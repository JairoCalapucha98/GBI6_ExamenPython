TI  - Heavy metals in vegetables: a review of status, human health concerns, andmanagement options.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22210-w [doi]
AB  - For sustainable global growth, food security is a prime concern issue, bothquantitatively and qualitatively. Adverse effects on crop quality fromcontaminants like heavy metals have affected food security and human health.Vegetables comprise the essential and nutritious part of the human diet as theycontain a lot of health-promoting minerals and vitamins. However, the inadvertentexcess accumulation of heavy metals (As, Cd, Hg, and Pb) in vegetables and their subsequent intake by humans may affect their physiology and metabolomics and has been associated with diseases like cancer, mental retardation, andimmunosuppression. Many known sources of hazardous metals are volcano eruptions, soil erosion, use of chemical fertilizers in agriculture, the use of pesticidesand herbicides, and irrigation with wastewater, industrial effluents, etc. thatcontaminate the vegetables through the soil, air and water. In this review, theproblem of heavy metal contamination in vegetables is discussed along with theprospective management strategies like soil amendments, application ofbioadsorbents, membrane filtration, bioremediation, and nanoremediation.

TI  - An umbrella review of systematic reviews with meta-analysis on the role ofvitamins in Parkinson's disease.
LID - 10.1007/s13760-022-02055-3 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This umbrella review aimed to systematically review the availableliterature and assess the association of dietary intake or serum levels ofdifferent vitamins and the risk of PD, to help find out more efficient treatmentsfor PD patients by replenishing the deficiency of vitamins. METHODS:Pubmed/Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar and hand searching bibliographies ofretrieved articles in duplicate, were used to detect all relevant meta-analysesinvestigating the relationship between vitamins and PD. After study selection,data were extracted from previously published meta-analyses and pooled by Review Manager version 5.4 and CMA software version 2.2.064 to achieve effect sizes.Level of statistical significance was set at P </= 0.05. RESULTS: 14meta-analyses were included in the meta-review. Serum vitamin D and B12 levelswere significantly lower in PD (SMD = -0.67 and SMD = -0.40 respectively).Homocysteine (Hcy) levels were significantly higher in PD patients (SMD = 1.26). Also the odds ratio for highest vs. lowest vitamin E intake was 0.73 which wassignificant. However, there was no significant difference between vitamin A, Cand B6 intake or serum levels in PD vs. control groups. CONCLUSION: Serum vitaminD and B12 levels were significantly lower in PD in comparison to healthyindividuals, while Hcy level was significantly higher in PD patients. Also highervitamin E intake was associated with significantly lower risk of development ofPD in comparison to lower vitamin E intake. However, there was no significantdifference between risk of PD and higher vitamin A, C and B6 intake or serumlevels of folate.

TI  - 'omics-guided prediction of the pathway for metabolism of isoprene by Variovorax sp. WS11.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.16149 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria which inhabit soils and the leaves of trees partially mitigate therelease of the abundant volatile organic compound, isoprene(2-methyl-1,3-butadiene). While the initial steps of isoprene metabolism wereidentified in Rhodococcus sp. AD45 two decades ago, the isoprene metabolicpathway still remains largely undefined. Limited understanding of the functionsof isoG, isoJ and aldH, and uncertainty in the route of isoprene-derived carboninto central metabolism have hindered our understanding of isoprene metabolism.These previously uncharacterised iso genes are essential in Variovorax sp. WS11, determined by targeted mutagenesis. Using combined 'omics-based approaches, wepropose the complete isoprene metabolic pathway. Isoprene is converted topropionyl-CoA which is assimilated by the chromosomally-encoded methylmalonyl-CoApathway, requiring biotin and vitamin B12, with the plasmid-encoded methylcitratepathway potentially providing robustness against limitations in these vitamins.Key components of this pathway were induced by both isoprene and its initialoxidation product, epoxyisoprene, the principal inducer of isoprene metabolism inboth Variovorax sp. WS11 and Rhodococcus sp. AD45. Analysis of the genomes ofdistinct isoprene-degrading bacteria indicated that the genetic components of themethylcitrate and methylmalonyl-CoA pathways are not always present in isoprenedegraders, although incorporation of isoprene-derived carbon via propionyl-CoAand acetyl-CoA is universally indicated.

TI  - The role of inflammation and the possibilities of inflammation reduction toprevent cardiovascular events.
PG  - oeac039
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeac039 [doi]
AB  - Chronic systemic inflammation is a risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease(CVD). Whether this relationship extends to subclinical inflammation, quantified by values of circulating markers associated with inflammation in the high rangeof the normal interval, remains debatable. This narrative review evaluatesevidence exploring this relationship. A review of pharmacological andnon-pharmacological interventions, including diet and lifestyle strategies,supplements, nutraceuticals, and other natural substances aimed at reducinginflammation was also conducted, since few reviews have synthesized thisliterature. PubMed and EMBASE were used to search the literature and severalwell-studied triggers of inflammation [oxidized LDL, Lp(a), as well as C-reactiveprotein (CRP)/high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP)] were included to increasesensitivity and address the lack of existing reviews summarizing their influence in the context of inflammation. All resulting references were assessed. Overall, there is good data supporting associations between circulating hs-CRP and CVoutcomes. However, the same was not seen in studies evaluating triggers ofinflammation, such as oxidized LDL or Lp(a). There is also insufficient evidence showing treatments to target inflammation and lead to reductions in hs-CRP resultin improvements in CV outcomes, particularly in those with normal baseline levelsof hs-CRP. Regarding pharmacological interventions, statins, bempedoic acid, and apabetalone significantly reduce circulating hs-CRP, unlike PCSK-9 inhibitors. A variety of natural substances and vitamins were also evaluated and none reducedhs-CRP. Regarding non-pharmacological interventions, weight loss was stronglyassociated with reductions in circulating hs-CRP, whereas various dietaryinterventions and exercise regimens were not, unless accompanied by weight loss.

AB  - Laver (Porphya sp.) containing vitamins and minerals has a high total number ofbacteria of 6-7 log CFU/g. Changes in microbial count in dried laver by lightpulse, ultrahigh pressure, electron beam, and superheated steam treatment werecompared. It was decreased by 1.3-1.7 log using IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) for30-60 s at an irradiation distance of 80 mm in dried and wet laver. The keyparameters of IPL are energy intensity, processing time and irradiation distance.Light pulse inactivation is based on destruction of microbial DNA structure.Electron beam irradiation at 7 and 10 kGy resulted reduction of 1.8-3.2 logCFU/g. Dried laver was treated at 500 MPa of ultra-high pressure for 3 min, totalbacterial number showed no change. Applying superheated steam at 150 degrees Cfor 10 s, about 3.3 log CFU/g sterilized. However, it is difficult to apply dueto severe damage to sensory quality such as browning.

TI  - Prenatal vitamin intake in first month of pregnancy and DNA methylation in cordblood and placenta in two prospective cohorts.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s13072-022-00460-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal vitamin use is recommended before and during pregnancies fornormal fetal development. Prenatal vitamins do not have a standard formulation,but many contain calcium, folic acid, iodine, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, zinc,and vitamins A, B6, B12, and D, and usually they contain higher concentrations offolic acid and iron than regular multivitamins in the US Nutrient levels canimpact epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation, but relationships betweenmaternal prenatal vitamin use and DNA methylation have been relativelyunderstudied. We examined use of prenatal vitamins in the first month ofpregnancy in relation to cord blood and placenta DNA methylation in twoprospective pregnancy cohorts: the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation(EARLI) and Markers of Autism Risk Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) studies.RESULTS: In placenta, prenatal vitamin intake was marginally associated with-0.52% (95% CI -1.04, 0.01) lower mean array-wide DNA methylation in EARLI, andassociated with -0.60% (-1.08, -0.13) lower mean array-wide DNA methylation inMARBLES. There was little consistency in the associations between prenatalvitamin intake and single DNA methylation site effect estimates across cohortsand tissues, with only a few overlapping sites with correlated effect estimates. However, the single DNA methylation sites with p-value < 0.01 (EARLI cord nCpGs =4068, EARLI placenta nCpGs = 3647, MARBLES cord nCpGs = 4068, MARBLES placentanCpGs = 9563) were consistently enriched in neuronal developmental pathways.CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings suggest that prenatal vitamin intake in thefirst month of pregnancy may be related to lower placental global DNA methylationand related to DNA methylation in brain-related pathways in both placenta andcord blood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dietary supplement (DS) use is widespread in the U.S. and contributeslarge amounts of micronutrients to users. Most studies have relied on data fromone assessment method to characterize the prevalence of DS use. Combiningmultiple methods enhances the ability to capture nutrient exposures from DS andexamine trends over time. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was tocharacterize DS use and examine trends in any DS as well asmicronutrient-containing (MN) DS use among a nationally representative sample of the U.S. population (>/=1y) from the 2007-2018 NHANES using a combined approach(i.e., DSMQ and/or >/=1 24HR). METHODS: NHANES obtains an in-home inventory with a frequency-based DS and Prescription Medicine Questionnaire (DSMQ), and two24-hr recalls (24HR). The objective of this study was to characterize DS use and examine trends in any and micronutrient-containing (MN) DS use among a nationallyrepresentative sample of the U.S. population (>/=1y) from the 2007-2018 NHANES,using a combined approach (i.e., DSMQ and/or >/=1 24HR). Trends in the prevalenceof use and selected types of products used were estimated for the population and by sex, age, race/Hispanic origin, family income (poverty-to-income ratio (PIR)),and household food security (food-secure vs. food-insecure). Linear trends weretested using orthogonal polynomials (significance set at p<0.05). RESULTS: DS useincreased from 50% in 2007 to 56% in 2018 (p = 0.001); use of MN productsincreased from 46% to 49% (p = 0.03), and single-nutrient DS (e.g., magnesium,vitamins B12 and D) use also increased (all p<0.001). In contrast,multivitamin-mineral use decreased (70% to 56%; p<0.001). Among adults (>/=19y), any (54% to 61%) and MN (49% to 54%) DS use increased, especially among men,non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics, and low-income adults (PIR</=130%). Amongchildren (1-18y), any DS use remained stable ( approximately 38%), as did MN use,except for food-insecure children, whose use increased from 24% to 31% over thedecade (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of any and MN DS use increasedover time in the U.S. This may be partially attributed to increased use ofsingle-nutrient products. Population subgroups differed in their DS use.

AB  - The potential for utilizing plant-derived components, such as plant proteins,polysaccharides, lipids, and phospholipids, to create targeted drug deliverysystems has been demonstrated in recent years. These colloidal delivery systemscan encapsulate, protect, and release pharmaceuticals, vitamins, andnutraceuticals, thereby improving their bioavailability and efficacy. Moreover,they have the potential to reduce the side effects associated with someconventional drug formulations, while still achieving controlled or targeteddelivery of pharmaceutical agents by various administration routes, includingoral, nasal, dermal and inhalation. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamicprofiles of drugs can be modulated by altering the composition, dimensions, andstructure of drug formulations created using plant-based colloidal deliverysystems. The utilization of plant-derived ingredients may also reduce theenvironmental impact and improve the sustainability of drug formulations.Initially, we provide an overview of the general characteristics and requirementsof drug delivery systems. The opportunities and challenges of using plant-derivedcomponents to fabricate colloidal particles for drug delivery applications isthen discussed. Finally, potential clinical applications of plant-based delivery drug systems are reviewed.

PG  - 1-14
LID - 10.1080/27697061.2022.2103852 [doi]
AB  - Spirulina is a blue-green algae which is cultivated not only for its maximumprotein content but also due to the presence of other essential nutrients such ascarbohydrates and vitamins (A, C and E). It is also a storehouse of mineralsincluding iron, calcium, chromium, copper, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus,potassium, sodium and zinc. Simultaneously, gamma- linolenic acid (an essentialfatty acid), as well as pigments such as chlorophyll A and phycobiliproteins(C-phycocyanin, allophycocyanin and beta-carotene), is also a major component of its rich nutritional profile. Spirulina is known to have various promisingeffects on the prevention of cancer, oxidative stress, obesity, diabetes,cardiovascular diseases and anemia. Moreover, it also plays a positive role intreating muscular cramps. The safety recommended dosage of Spirulina isapproximately 3-10 g/d for adults and it's biological value (BV) is 75 with a netprotein utilization (NPU) of 62. Spirulina does not have pericardium due to whichit does not hinder the absorption of iron by chelation with phytates or oxalates.On the contrasting note, it may have some adverse effects due to the toxins(microcystins, beta-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA)) produced by Spirulina whichmight contribute to acute poisoning, cancer, liver damage as well asgastrointestinal disturbances. Its long-term consumption may also lead to thepathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. The current reviewfocuses on the various aspects of spirulina including its cultivation,nutritional composition, extraction techniques, health benefits, adverse effects,industrial scope and market value which could be beneficial for its utilizationin the development of value-added products and supplementary foods due to itshigh content of protein and bioavailability of nutrients.

TI  - Vitamin C Sensitizes Pancreatic Cancer Cells to Erastin-Induced Ferroptosis byActivating the AMPK/Nrf2/HMOX1 Pathway.
PG  - 5361241
LID - 10.1155/2022/5361241 [doi]
AB  - Ferroptosis is a type of regulated cell death that displays a promisingtherapeutic pathway for drug-resistant tumor cells. However, some pancreaticcancer (PC) cells are less sensitive to erastin-induced ferroptosis, and normalpancreatic cells are susceptible to this newly discovered cell death. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find drugs to enhance the sensitivity of these PCcells to erastin while limiting side effects. Here, we found that the oxidizedform of vitamin C-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) can be transported into PC cellsexpressing high levels of GLUT1, resulting in ferroptosis. Moreover,pharmacological vitamin C combined with erastin can synergistically induceferroptosis of PC cells involving glutathione (GSH) reduction and ferrous ironaccumulation while inhibiting the cytotoxicity of normal cells. Mechanistically, as a direct system Xc(-) inhibitor, erastin can directly suppress the synthesisof GSH, and the recycling of vitamin C and DHA is performed through GSHconsumption, which is denoted as the classical mode. Furthermore, oxidativestress induced by erastin and vitamin C could enhance the expression of HMOX1 viathe AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor2 (NRF2) pathway to increase the labile iron level, which is named thenonclassical mode. In vivo experiments showed that erastin and vitamin C cansignificantly slow tumor growth in PC xenografts. In summary, the combination of erastin and vitamin C exerts a synergistic effect of classical and nonclassicalmodes to induce ferroptosis in PC cells, which may provide a promisingtherapeutic strategy for PC.

TI  - Vitamin D intake and gastric cancer in Viet Nam: a case-control study.
PG  - 838
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09933-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most recent laboratory studies have suggested a promising role ofvitamin D and its analogs as novel chemotherapeutic agents for cancer treatment. However, epidemiological evidence, especially regarding the effects of vitamin D on gastric cancer is still inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: Our research aimed toevaluate the associations between vitamin D intake and the risk of developinggastric cancer through a case-control study in North Vietnam. METHODS: Weaccessed databases of the previous completed case-control studies to derive 1182 incident gastric cancer cases and 2995 hospital controls selected from hospitals in Hanoi from 2003 to 2019. Vitamin D intake was computed by multiplying the foodfrequency intake with nutrient content based on the Viet Nam Food CompositionTables. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews by trainedinterviewers using the validated semi-quantitative food frequency and demographiclifestyle questionnaires. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (OR and95%CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: We observed a continual decline in gastric cancer risk according to the level-up of vitamin D intake in both genders, men, and women [Fifth vs. bottom quintile,OR, 95%CI: 0.68 (0.53, 0.86), OR, 95%CI: 0.72 (0.53, 0.97), OR, 95%CI: 0.58(0.38, 0.89), respectively. Per increment quintile, the statistically significantdecreased risk was seen by 7% in men and 13% in women. The significant inverseassociation between vitamin D intake remained in the subgroups of ever and never tobacco smoking; negative and positive H. pylori infection. CONCLUSION: Thefindings suggested that sufficient vitamin D intake was associated with a lowerrisk of Gastric Cancer in the Vietnamese population.

AB  - Sensitive quantification of protein biomarkers is highly desired for clinicaldiagnosis and treatment. Yet, unlike DNA/RNA which can be greatly amplified byPCR/RT-PCR, the amplification and detection of trace amount of proteins remain a great challenge. Here, we combined allosteric probe (AP) with magnetic bead (MB) for assembling an on-bead DNA synthesis system (named as APMB) to amplify proteinsignals. The AP is designed and conjugated onto the MB, enabling the proteinbiomarker to be separated and enriched. Once recognizing the biomarker, the APalters its conformation to initiate DNA synthesis on beads for primary signalamplification. During the DNA synthesis, biotin-dATPs are incorporated into thenewly synthesized DNA strands. Then, the biotin-labeled DNA specifically capturesstreptavidin (STR)-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (HRP), which is used tocatalyze a colorimetric reaction for secondary signal amplification. By usingcarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a protein model, the APMB can quantify protein biomarkers of as low as 0.01 ng/mL. The response values measured by APMB arelinearly related to the protein concentrations in the range 0.05 to 20 ng/mL.Clinical examination demonstrated good practicability of the APMB in quantifying serum protein biomarker. The on-bead DNA synthesis could be exploited to improve protein signal amplification, thus facilitating protein biomarker detection oflow abundance for early diagnosis.

AB  - Objectives: Studies have suggested that dietary intake of antioxidant vitaminslike vitamin C and vitamin E has a potential role in inhibiting gastriccarcinogenesis. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect ofantioxidant vitamins on the incidence of gastric intestinal metaplasia (GIM).Methods: Study participants were 67,657 Koreans free of GIM who periodicallyunderwent health check-up. Dietary intake was assessed by semi-quantitative FFQdeveloped based on the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.They were categorized into four groups by the quartile levels of dietary intakeof vitamin C and vitamin E. Cox proportional hazard assumption was used tomultivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for GIM.Results: Third and fourth quartile group of vitamin C intake had the lower riskof GIM than first quartile group (multivariable adjusted HR [95% CI] = 0.95 [0.88- 1.03] in 2nd quartile, 0.88 [0.81 - 0.97] in 3rd quartile and 0.85 [0.76 -0.95] in 4th quartile). Vitamin E intake more than second quartile level wassignificantly associated with the decreased risk of GIM than first quartile groupof vitamin E intake (multivariable adjusted HR [95% CI] = 0.90 [0.82 - 0.97] in2nd quartile, 0.90 [0.82 - 0.99] in 3rd quartile and 0.83 [0.74 - 0.94] in 4thquartile). This association was observed only in subgroup analysis for men.Conclusion: Increased dietary intake of vitamin C and vitamin E was associatedwith the decreased risk of GIM.

AB  - Beef represents an important source of high-quality dietary protein and severalmicronutrients including iron, zinc, and B vitamins. Consumption of lean meatincluding lean beef is recommended by the Dietary Guidelines for Americans2020-2025 as part of overall healthy diet. Given beef intake has been declining, the objective of this study was to provide updated evaluation of the nutritional contribution of beef types. Twenty-four-hour dietary recall data from adults age 19+ years (n = 19,766) participating in the National Health and NutritionExamination Survey 2011-2018 was used to assess intakes. On the day of recall,49.3%, 40.2%, 26.3%, and 15.3% adults consumed total beef, lean fresh beef,ground beef, and processed beef, respectively, with mean intakes of 45.6, 36.6,21.3, and 6.23 g/day, respectively. Intake of total beef contributed to dailyintakes of energy (5.4%), protein (14%), vitamin B12 (20%), zinc (21%), choline(11%), niacin (9.4%), vitamin B6 (8.3%), iron (7.6%), phosphorus (6.8%),potassium (5.6%), and magnesium (3%). Lean fresh beef contributed most to thedaily intakes of energy and nutrients followed by ground and processed beef. Beefintake also contributed to daily intakes of fat (8.7%), saturated fat (11%), and sodium (2.9%) and lean fresh beef contributed less intakes of fat and saturatedfat than ground and processed beef. Beef and particularly lean fresh beef wereefficient sources of nutrients and provided more nutrients per 100 kcal than the total diet. In conclusion, based on nutrient contribution, these findings provideevidence to support inclusion of beef (especially lean fresh beef) in dietaryrecommendations.

TI  - Changes in Rat Scleral Collagen Structure Induced by UVA-Riboflavin Crosslinking at Various Tissue Depths in Whole Globe Versus Scleral Patch.
PG  - 2
LID - 10.1167/tvst.11.8.2 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To investigate structural changes in scleral collagen fibers at various tissue depths before and after photosensitized crosslinking (CXL) both isolatedscleral patch versus whole globe using second-harmonic generation (SHG) imaging. Methods: Scleral tissues were harvested from Sprague-Dawley rats and separatedinto three groups: untreated sclera (control), full-thickness scleral patch forCXL (Free Scleral CXL group), and sclera in intact globe for CXL (Globe CXLgroup). The CXL groups were soaked in 0.1% riboflavin and irradiated with 365 nm ultraviolet-A light (power, 0.45 mW/cm2) for 30 minutes. SHG images were acquiredevery 5 microm between 10 and 60 microm from the outer scleral surface. Collagen fiber waviness was calculated as the ratio of the total length of a traced fiber and the length of a straight path between the fiber ends. Results: In the FreeScleral CXL group, collagen waviness was significantly increased compared to the control group at 35 to 50 microm (P < 0.05). In the Globe CXL group, collagenwaviness was decreased compared to control at all depths with statisticalsignificance (P < 0.05) achieved from 10 to 45 microm. Conclusions: Dependingupon its initial state (i.e., free scleral patch versus mechanically loadedintact globe under pressure), collagen may experience different structuralchanges after CXL. In addition, the extent of the CXL effects may vary atdifferent depths away from the surface. Translational Relevance: Understandingthe CXL effects on collagen structure may be important in optimizing the scleral crosslinking protocol for future clinical applications such as preventing myopic progression.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate how the application of vitamin Eaffected the levels of chemical elements in the brain tissues of epilepsy-inducedrats. The sample of 40 adult male rats was separated into 4 equal groups: Group1: control, Group 2: vitamin E; Group 3: penicillin to promote epileptic formactivity and Group 4: penicillin + vitamin E. After three months of treatment, anAtomic Absorption Spectrophotometer was used to analyze the presence of theelements in brain tissue sections (brain, brainstem, cerebellum) of thedecapitated animals. The levels of magnesium in the groups that received vitamin E (G2 and 4) were significantly higher than in the control group (G1) and thefirst epilepsy group (G3) (p.05).Chrome and zinc levels in brain, brainstem, and cerebellum tissue of the two epilepsy groups (G3-4) decreased significantlycompared to the control group (G1) and the vitamin E group (G2) (p.05). Thelevels of copper in the brainstem and lead in the cerebellum of the firstepilepsy group (G3) were higher than in all other groups (p.05). The findingsshowed that the application of vitamin E in experimental epilepsy may have alimited effect on element metabolism in brain tissue. A decline in zinc levels inthe brain, brainstem and cerebellum tissues in epilepsy groups constitutesanother result of our study. This should be examined further to determine whetherdecreased levels of zinc play a role in epilepsy pathogenesis.

AB  - There is an increasing demand for biomaterials with skull regeneration forclinical application. However, most of the current skull repair materials stillhave limitations, such as inadequate sources, poor cell adherence,differentiation, tissue infiltration, and foreign body sensation. Therefore, thisstudy developed porous microsphere-based scaffolds containing mouse embryonicosteoblast precursor cells (MC3T3-E1 cells) and calcitriol (Cal) using gelatinand gelatin/hydroxyapatite through green freeze-crosslinking and freeze-drying.Gelatin was employed to prepare porous microspheres with a particle size of100-300 mum, containing open pores of 2-70 mum and interconnected paths.Furthermore, the addition of Cal to porous gelatin microsphere-based scaffoldscontaining MC3T3-E1 cells (PGMSs-MC) and porous gelatin/hydroxyapatite composite microspheres containing MC3T3-E1 cells (HPGMSs-MC) improved theirosteoinductivity and cell proliferation and promoted the formation of mature and well-organized bone. The developed Cal-HPGMSs-MC and Cal-PGMSs-MC displayed agood porous structure and cytocompatibility, histocompatibility,osteoconductivity, and osteoinduction. Thus, the designed scaffolds provide apromising prospect for tissue-engineered constructs with skull growth andintegration, laying a foundation for further research on the reconstruction ofskull defects.

TI  - Microalgae and Bacteria Interaction-Evidence for Division of Diligence in theAlga Microbiota.
PG  - e0063322
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00633-22 [doi]
AB  - Microalgae are one of the most dominant forms of life on earth that is tightlyassociated with a distinct and specialized microbiota. We have previously shownthat the microbiota of Scenedesmus quadricauda harbors less than 10 distinctmicrobial species. Here, we provide evidence that dominant species are affiliatedwith the genera of Variovorax, Porphyrobacter, and Dyadobacter. Experimental and transcriptome-based evidence implies that within this multispecies interaction,Dyadobacter is a key to alga growth and fitness and is highly adapted to live in the phycosphere. While presumably under light conditions the alga provides theenergy source to the bacteria, Dyadobacter produces and releases mainly a largevariety of polysaccharides modifying enzymes. This is coherent with high-levelexpression of the T9SS in alga cocultures. The transcriptome data further implythat quorum-quenching proteins (QQ) and biosynthesis of vitamins B1, B2, B5, B6, and B9 are expressed by Dyadobacter at high levels in comparison to Variovoraxand Porphyrobacter. Notably, Dyadobacter produces a significant number ofleucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins and enzymes involved in bacterial reactiveoxygen species (ROS) tolerance. Complementary to this, Variovorax expresses thegenes of the biosynthesis of vitamins B2, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12, andPorphyrobacter is specialized in the production of vitamins B2 and B6. Thus, the shared currency between partners are vitamins, microalgae growth-promotingsubstances, and dissolved carbon. This work significantly enlarges our knowledge on alga-bacteria interaction and demonstrates physiological investigations ofmicroalgae and associated bacteria, using microscopy observations, photosyntheticactivity measurements, and flow cytometry. IMPORTANCE The current study gives adetailed insight into mutualistic collaboration of microalgae and bacteria,including the involvement of competitive interplay between bacteria. We provideexperimental evidence that Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Dyadobacter,Porphyrobacter, and Variovorax are the key players in a Scenedesmus quadricaudaalga-bacteria interaction. We impart strong evidence that Dyadobacter producesand releases polysaccharides degradation enzymes and leucine-rich repeatproteins; Variovorax supplies the consortium with auxins and vitamin B12, whilePorphyrobacter produces a broad spectrum of B vitamins. We show not only that themicroalgae collaborate with the bacteria and vice versa but also that thebacteria interact with each other via quorum-sensing and secretion systemmechanisms. The shared currency between partners appears to be vitamins,microalgae growth-promoting substances, and dissolved carbon.

TI  - Nutrition program, physical activity and gut microbiota modulation: a randomized controlled trial to promote a healthy lifestyle in students with vitamin D3deficiency.
PG  - 683-694
LID - 10.23736/S0026-4806.22.07992-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: University students are a high-risk group for stress, consumption of junk food and significant weight gain over a short period. Inadequate vitamin Dintake has been linked to many health issues, including chronic headache, apathy,aggression and depression. Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency led to dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. The purpose of our study was to estimate the effect of90-days healthy lifestyle programs along with gut microbiota modulation inuniversity students with vitamin D<inf>3</inf> deficiency. METHODS: In thisrandomized controlled trial, 130 students (18-25 years old) with vitamin Ddeficiency were recruited. Both the standard care group (N.=65) and theintervention group (N.=65) received a 3-months course of individually selectednutrition program and physical activity (8000-10,000 steps daily). Theintervention group received an additional treatment with synbiotic Acidolac andvitamin D<inf>3</inf> for 3 months. The psycho-emotional status of theparticipants was assessed by a validated questionnaire that examined situational anxiety. In all students, blood pressure, anthropometric variables, as well aslaboratory metabolic parameters, were recorded. RESULTS: In both groups, vitamin D<inf>3</inf> deficiency was associated with instability and lability of mentalprocesses, mood swings, bad sleep, high rates of stuck and agitation for anyproblem. Combined therapy (diet, physical activity and synbiotic) induced asignificant improvement in the psycho-emotional state of students. The 90-daystherapy vitamin D<inf>3</inf> increased the level of vitamin D<inf>3</inf> inserum in the intervention group. Lastly, we observed a decrease in the bodyweight, body mass index, waist circumference and fatty mass, only in studentsincluded in the interventional group. CONCLUSIONS: Nutrition program, physicalactivity, vitamin D<inf>3</inf> intake and gut microbiota modulation led to both the improvement in vitamin D levels in serum and emotional harmonization.

AB  - Vitamin D is essential for bone and muscle health with adequate status inchildhood crucial for normal skeletal development. We aimed to investigatevitamin D status in a convenience sample (n = 1226) of Irish children (aged 1-17 years) who had serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) tested by request of their GP at a Dublin Hospital between 2014 and 2020. We examined predictors including age,sex, season and socioeconomic status (SES). Vitamin D deficiency (<30 nmol/l) wasprevalent affecting 23 % and was more common in disadvantaged areas (34 %) and inthose aged >12 v. </=12 years (24 % v. 16 %, P = 0033). The greatest predictorwas SES (disadvantaged v. affluent, OR 218, CI 134, 353, P = 0002), followed byfemale sex (OR 157, CI 115, 214, P = 0005) and winter season (October toFebruary, OR 140, CI 107, 184, P = 0015). A quarter of our sample of childrenwere deficient, rising to one-third in those in disadvantaged areas. Females and those aged over 12 years had a higher prevalence of deficiency. Public healthstrategies to improve vitamin D status in Irish children, including systematicfood fortification may need to be considered to address this issue.

PG  - e58

AB  - The present study examined the effect of picture-based nutrition education onknowledge and adherence to pre-conception iron-folic acid supplement (IFAS) inEthiopia, a country where there is a high burden of neural tube defects (NTDs)and anaemia. In eastern Ethiopia, a parallel randomised controlled trial designwas employed among women planning to get pregnant. The interventional arm (n 122)received a preconception picture-based nutrition education and counselling along with an IFAS and the control arm (n 122) received only a preconception IFAS. The effects of the intervention between-group differences were assessed using a chi(2) and independent sample t-test. Bivariate and multivariable linear regression model was fitted to detect independent variables affecting the outcome. Theoutcome measures regarding the knowledge and adherence to the IFAS intake during the three months of the intervention period were deteremined. It was observedthat large proportion of women in the intervention group (426 %) had an adherenceto IFAS compared to the control group (33 %); (P < 00001). Based on bivariate andmultivariable linear regression analyses, among NTDs affecting pregnancy, thehistory of spontaneous abortion and knowledge were independently associated with adherence to the IFAS (P < 005). Preconception nutrition education with regularfollow-ups could be effective in improving knowledge and adherence to the IFASintake. This intervention is very short, simple, cost-effective and has thepotential for adaptation development to a large-scale implementation in theexisting healthcare system in Ethiopia to prevent NTDs and adverse birth outcomesamong women who plan to get pregnant. This clinical trial was registered on 6April 2021 under the ClinicalTrials.gov with an identifier numberPACTR202104543567379.

PG  - 9407888
LID - 10.1155/2022/9407888 [doi]
AB  - Background: The relationship between vitamin D and atopic dermatitis (AD) iscontroversial. This meta-analysis is aimed at exploring vitamin D level and itsdeficiency in pediatric AD and at evaluating the efficacy of vitamin Dsupplementation. Methods: PubMed, Medline, Embase, Ovid, Cochrane Library, ISIWeb of Science, and ClinicalTrials were searched. Binary variables and continuousvariables were measured by odds ratio (OR) and mean difference (MD) with 95%confidence intervals, respectively. The modified Jadad scale, Newcastle-OttawaScale (NOS), and Cochrane's bias risk tools were used to evaluate study qualityand the risk of bias of eligible studies, respectively. Results: A total of 22literature were included in the analysis. Serum 25 (OH) D level in pediatric ADpatients was significantly lower than that of the control group with a combinedMD value of -8.18 (95% CI: -13.15, -3.22). Patients with AD were more prone todevelop vitamin D deficiency with a combined OR value of 2.17 (95% CI: 1.15,4.11). According to the score of SCORAD, the level of serum 25 (OH) D level inpatients with severe AD was significantly lower than that in patients with mildAD (combined MD = 9.23, 95% CI: 6.92, 11.55). Both self-control studies andrandomized controlled trials showed improved SCORAD score and EASI score aftervitamin D supplementation. Conclusion: This meta-analysis showed lower serum 25(OH) D level and increased risk of vitamin D deficiency in pediatric AD patients as compared with healthy controls. The serum 25 (OH) D level in severe ADpatients was significantly lower than that in the mild AD patients. The SCORADand EASI score improved after vitamin D supplementation, suggesting itsbeneficial effect to AD patients. At the same time, more homogeneous studies are needed to reduce confounding factors and further evaluate the impact of vitamin Dtreatment on the outcome of AD patients.

AB  - Objective: To examine the clinical efficacy and safety of Vitamin D in thetreatment of ulcerative colitis in a systematic manner. Methods: RCT studies onVitamin D in the treatment of ulcerative colitis were searched from CNKI, WanfangData, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases. RevMan 5.4 softwarewas used for analysis. Results: 10 articles were included, including 1077patients. Meta-analysis results showed that when clinical efficacy was used asthe outcome index, the clinical efficacy of the oral vitamin group was higherthan that of the conventional treatment group (OR = 4.07, 95% CI 2.64-6.27), and the difference was statistically significant (Z = 6.38, P < 0.00001). When theMayo risk score was used as the outcome index, the difference was statisticallysignificant, indicating that oral Vitamin D significantly reduced the Mayo riskscore (MD: -0.41, CI = (-0.47, -0.34), Z = 13.09, P < 0.00001). Using theintestinal mucosal barrier as the outcome index, the results showed that (1) the MDA group (MD = -0.75, 95% CI (-0.96~-0.53), P < 0.00001), (2) the DAO group (MD = -1.17, 95% CI (-1.39-0.95), P < 0.00001), and the Vitamin D group couldeffectively improve intestinal mucosal barrier function after sensitivityanalysis (MD = -1.00, 95% CI (-1.08-0.92), P < 0.00001). When inflammatoryfactors were used as outcome indicators, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and CRP groups hadstatistical significance (MD = -4.50, 95% CI (-5.13-3.87), P < 0.00001); MD =-7.27, 95% CI (18.96-5.58), P < 0.00001; and MD = -1.49, 95% CI (-1.76~-1.23), P < 0.00001, respectively). When the incidence of adverse reactions was used as theoutcome indicator (OR = 0.73, 95% CI (0.34-1.32), P = 0.23), there was nosignificant difference between the two groups. Conclusion: Vitamin D combinedwith mesalazine is effective in the treatment of ulcerative colitis, by improvingthe Mayo score and intestinal barrier function, and reducing inflammatoryfactors, with no significant safety difference. However, due to the quality ofthe included researches, more RCT researches needed to provide sufficientevidence to support clinical application. This study is registered with INPLASY202250044.

TI  - Mucin 1 Inhibits Ferroptosis and Sensitizes Vitamin E to Alleviate Sepsis-InducedAcute Lung Injury through GSK3beta/Keap1-Nrf2-GPX4 Pathway.
PG  - 2405943
LID - 10.1155/2022/2405943 [doi]
AB  - Background: Ferroptosis is a nonapoptotic form of programmed cell death, whichmay be related to the occurrence and development of sepsis-induced acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/acute lung injury (ALI). Mucin 1 (MUC1) is akind of macromolecule transmembrane glycoprotein. Previous studies have shownthat MUC1 could relieve ALI in sepsis and predict whether sepsis patients woulddevelop into ARDS. However, the role of MUC1 in the ferroptosis of sepsis-inducedALI/ARDS remains unclear. Materials and Methods: Sera samples from 50 patientswith sepsis/septic shock were used to detect iron metabolism-related markers.Western blot and qRT-PCR were conducted to detect the expression levels offerroptosis-related genes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) wasperformed to evaluate inflammatory factors. Transmission electron microscopy(TEM) was used to assess morphological changes of cells. Results: The resultsshowed that the iron metabolism-related indicators in sepsis-induced ARDSpatients changed significantly, suggesting the iron metabolism disorder. Theexpression levels of ferroptosis-related genes in lung tissues of sepsis hadmarked changes, and the lipid peroxidation levels increased, while Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) could reverse the above results, which confirmed the occurrence offerroptosis. In terms of mechanism studies, inhibition of MUC1 dimerization couldincrease the expression level of Keap1, reduce the phosphorylation level ofGSK3beta, inhibit the entry of Nrf2 into the nucleus, further inhibit theexpression level of GPX4, enhance the lipid peroxidation level of lung tissues,trigger ferroptosis, and aggravate lung injury. Besides, inhibiting MUC1 reversedthe alleviating effect of vitamin E on ALI caused by sepsis, increased theaggregation of inflammatory cells in lung tissues, and aggravated alveolar injuryand edema. Conclusions: Our study was the first to explore the changes of ironmetabolism indicators in ALI/ARDS of sepsis, clarify the important role offerroptosis in ALI/ARDS induced by sepsis, and reveal the effects and specificmechanisms of MUC1 in regulating ferroptosis, as well as the sensitization onvitamin E.

PG  - 9506026
LID - 10.1155/2022/9506026 [doi]
AB  - Methods: This study was conducted among 60 rats, and groups consist of control,three separate groups for RJ, dimethylhydrazine (DMH), and vitamin E, and twoseparate treated groups with DMH + RJ and DMH + vitamin E. Additionally, thecytotoxicity of royal jelly was examined on HT-29 cell line. Findings. Based onthe in vitro assessment using MTT assay, the LC50 of royal jelly was 1.781 mg/ml,and the highest cytotoxicity was observed at 25 mg/ml concentration after 48hours. Meanwhile, in the in vivo study, after the 13th week, compared to the DMH group, the rats exposed to DMH + royal jelly experienced a significant lessoxidative stress (P < 0.05) and a significantly greater total antioxidantcapacity (TAC) level (P < 0.05). The expression of proliferating cell nuclearantigen (PCNA), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and carcinoembryonicantigen (CEA) proteins significantly decreased among the animals receiving DMH + royal jelly compared to the DMH group. The pathological examinations revealedless congestion, necrosis, inflammation, and cell proliferation in the colontissue of the RJ-treated group than that of the DMH group. Overall, thebiochemical indices were better in the treatment groups in comparison with theDMH group. Conclusion: The results represented the clinical usability of royaljelly, as a substance with anticancer properties, to prevent and treat colorectalcancer. This issue is related to its effective antioxidant potential, which even exhibits more effectiveness than the vitamin E, which is known as a strongantioxidant.

TI  - Association of Vitamins D, B9 and B12 with Obesity-Related Diseases and OralMicrobiota Composition in Obese Women in Croatia.
PG  - 135-144
LID - 10.17113/ftb.60.02.22.7478 [doi]
AB  - Research background: Oral microbiota has become an important factor in obesity,but its association with obesity-related diseases and serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH)D] and B complex amounts is still uncertain. The main aim of the paper is to determine the variation in oral microbiota composition as a response to thevitamin status and obesity-related diseases in obese females from Croatia. Wehypothesized that the prevalence of probiotic or pathogenic bacteria in the oral cavity of obese women in Croatia depends on the amounts of vitamin B9 (folicacid), B12 and 25(OH)D in serum and/or hypertension, diabetes and prediabetesdiagnosis. Experimental approach: To test the defined research hypothesis, femaleindividuals with body mass index (BMI)>/=30 kg/m(2) (N=70) were recruited toparticipate in this study. Obese women were divided into groups according to BMI value, diagnosis of obesity-related diseases and amount of micronutrient inblood. For the quantitative determination of folic acid, vitamin B12 and 25(OH)D in serum, an electrochemiluminescence protein binding assay (ECLIA) wasperformed. Microorganisms isolated from the saliva of obese women were analyzedby MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Results and conclusions: The presented results donot support the hypothesis that the prevalence of probiotic or pathogenicbacteria in the oral cavity of obese women in Croatia depends on the amount ofmicronutrients. On the other hand, hypertension and diabetes/prediabetes favourthe growth of oral pathogens, specifically increased levels of Candida sp.Novelty and scientific contribution: To the best of our knowledge, this is thefirst study showing the relationship between obesity, micronutrient amount, oral microbiota composition, and the incidence of obesity-related disease. We includedonly obese women from Croatia, so it is regionally specific. Also, we have shown that oral microbiota composition is not connected with micronutrient deficienciesbut only with obesity-related diseases.

AB  - Characterizing the gut microbiota of free-range and alternative poultryproduction systems provides information, which can be used to improve poultrywelfare, performance, and environmental sustainability. Gut microbiota influence not only the health and metabolism of the host but also the presence of zoonotic agents contaminating food of animal origin. In this study, the composition anddiversity of the cecal microbiota community of free-range grown chickens werecharacterized by 16S rDNA high-throughput Illumina sequencing. Significantdifferences were observed in the composition of chicken cecal microbiota at thetime points of 28 days of age (Indoor group) and 56 days of age (Outdoor group), i.e., before and after the outdoor access period of chicken groups. The Outdoorgroup showed a richer and more complex microbial community, characterized by the onset of new phyla such as Deferribacterota and Synergistota, while the Indoorgroup showed an increase in Campylobacterota. At the species level, it isnoteworthy that the occurrence of Mucispirillum schaedleri in Outdoor group isknown to potentially stimulate mucus layer formation in the distal intestinaltract, thus being associated with a healthy gut. We also report a significantdecrease in the Outdoor group of Helicobacter pullorum, highlighting that thelower abundance at the age of slaughter reduced the possibility to contaminatechickens' carcasses and, consequently, its zoonotic potential. As revealed by amutual exclusion study in network analysis, H. pullorum was present only ifBacteroides barnesiae, an uncultured organism of the genus Synergistes, andBacteroides gallinaceum were absent. Finally, microbiome predictive analysisrevealed an increase of vitamins and micronutrient biosyntheses such as queuosine(Q) and its precursor pre Q0, in the Outdoor group, suggesting that the outdoorevolved microbiota of chickens do contribute to the vitamin pool of the gut andthe biosynthesis of micronutrients involved in vital cell processes.

AB  - The genome of an organism is directly or indirectly correlated with itsenvironment. Consequently, different microbes have evolved to survive and sustainthemselves in a variety of environments, including unusual anaerobicenvironments. It is believed that their genetic material could have played animportant role in the early evolution of their existence in the past. Presently, out of the uncountable number of microbes found in different ecosystems we havebeen able to discover only one percent of the total communities. A large majorityof the microbial populations exists in the most unusual and extreme environments.For instance, many anaerobic bacteria are found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans, soil, and hydrothermal vents. The recent advancements in Metagenomics andNext Generation Sequencing technologies have improved the understanding of their roles in these environments. Presently, anaerobic bacteria are used in variousindustries associated with biofuels, fermentation, production of enzymes,vaccines, vitamins, and dairy products. This broad applicability brings focus to the significant contribution of their genomes in these functions. Although theanaerobic microbes have become an irreplaceable component of our lives, a majorand important section of such anaerobic microbes still remain unexplored.Therefore, it can be said that unlocking the role of the microbial genomes of theanaerobes can be a noteworthy discovery not just for mankind but for the entirebiosystem as well.

AB  - The use of rhizobacteria provide great benefits in terms of nitrogen supply,suppression of plant diseases, or production of vitamins and phytohormones thatstimulate the plant growth. At the same time, cyanobacteria can photosynthesize, fix nitrogen, synthesize substances that stimulate rhizogenesis, plant aerialgrowth, or even suppose an extra supply of carbon usable by heterotrophicbacteria, as well as act as biological control agents, give them an enormousvalue as plant growth promoters. The present study focused on the in vitroestablishment of consortia using heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria and thedetermination of their effectiveness in the development of tomato seedlings.Microbial collection was composed of 3 cyanobacteria (SAB-M612 and SAB-B866belonging to Nostocaceae Family) and GS (unidentified cyanobacterium) and twophosphate and potassium solubilizing heterotrophic bacteria (Pseudomonasputida-BIO175 and Pantoea cypripedii-BIO175). The results revealed the influence of the culture medium, incubation time and the microbial components of eachconsortium in determining their success as biofertilizers. In this work, the mostcompatible consortia were obtained by combining the SAB-B866 and GS cyanobacteriawith either of the two heterotrophic bacteria. Cyanobacteria GS promoted thegrowth of both rhizobacteria in vitro (increasing logarithmic units when theygrew together). While Cyanobacteria SAB-B866 together with both rhizobacteriastimulated the growth of tomato seedlings in planta, leading to greater aerialdevelopment of the treated seedlings. Parameters such as fresh weight and stemdiameter stood out in the plants treated with the consortia (SAB-B866 and bothbacteria) compared to the untreated plants, where the values doubled. However,the increase was more discrete for the parameters stem length and number ofleaves. These results suggest that the artificial formulation of microbialconsortia can have positive synergistic effects on plant growth, which is ofenormous agro-biotechnological interest.

TI  - Clinical Outcomes of S-1 Monotherapy and Modified FOLFIRINOX Therapy afterGemcitabine plus Nab-paclitaxel Therapy in Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer.
PG  - 2255-2261
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.8736-21 [doi]
AB  - Objective S-1 and modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) were often used as the second-linechemotherapies after failure of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (GnP) inunresectable pancreatic cancer (UPC) until nanoliposomal irinotecan plus5-fluorouracil/leucovorin therapy was approved as an alternative in Japan in2020. However, the clinical outcomes of S-1 and mFFX after GnP have scarcely beenreported. Therefore, we retrospectively studied them. Methods We extracted theclinical data of 86 patients with UPC who received second-line chemotherapy afterGnP between 2015 and 2020. Among the patients who had a good organ functions and no massive ascites, 41 patients treated with S-1 and 21 treated with mFFX wereenrolled. Results Compared to S-1, mFFX tended to be used for younger patientswith a good general condition (median age, 63 vs. 71 years, p<0.01; andperformance status 0, 67% vs. 37%, p<0.05). The median progression-free andoverall survival were similar between the S-1 (3.7 and 7.2 months, respectively) and mFFX (3.3 and 7.4 months, respectively) groups. The response rate in patientswith measurable lesions was 4% (n=1/23) in the S-1 group and 17% (n=2/12) in the mFFX group. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was 20% in the S-1 groupand 57% (neutrophil count decreased in 43%) in the mFFX group (p<0.01).Conclusion S-1 and mFFX were both acceptable second-line chemotherapies after GnPtherapy for UPC, although attention should be paid to myelosuppression duringmFFX treatment. Further studies involving nanoliposomal irinotecan plus5-fluorouracil/leucovorin therapy are necessary to facilitate the selection ofthe optimal regimen for each patient.

AB  - The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are one of the largest families ofmembrane-bound proteins and exist in almost all living organisms from eubacteria to mammals. They transport diverse substrates across membranes utilizing theenergy of ATP hydrolysis as a driving force and play an essential role incellular homeostasis. In humans, four ABC transporters classified as subfamily D have been identified. ABCD1-3 are localized to peroxisomal membranes and involvedin the transport of various acyl-CoAs from the cytosol to the peroxisomal lumen. ABCD4 functions on the lysosomal membranes and transports vitamin B12 (cobalamin)from lysosomes into the cytosol. The mutation of genes encoding ABCD1, ABCD3, andABCD4 are responsible for genetic diseases called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, congenital bile acid synthesis defect 5, and cobalamin deficiency, respectively. In this review, we summarize the targeting mechanism and physiological functions of the ABCD transporters and discuss insights that have been obtained on thetransport mechanism based on disease-causing mutations and cryo-electronmicroscopy (EM) structural studies.

AB  - Maintenance of mitochondrial health, which is supported in part by dietaryantioxidants such as selenium (Se) and vitamin E (vitE), is pertinent tooptimizing athletic performance. Deficiencies in Se and vitE negatively impactmuscle health but mitochondrial adaptations to various levels of dietary Se andvitE are poorly understood. Young Quarter Horses (mean +/- SD: 17.6 +/- 0.9 mo)undergoing submaximal exercise training were used to test the hypothesis that aproprietary antioxidant blend containing elevated Se yeast (EconomasE, Alltech,Inc., Nicholasville, KY) would improve mitochondrial characteristics compared to Se at current requirements, even with reduced vitE intake. Horses were balancedby age, sex, body weight (BW), and farm of origin and randomly assigned to one ofthree custom-formulated concentrates fed at 1% BW (dry matter, DM basis) for 12wk: 1) 100 IU vitE/kg DM and 0.1 mg Se/kg DM (CON, n = 6); 2) no added vitE plus EconomasE to provide 0.1 mg Se/kg DM (ESe1, n = 6); or 3) no added vitE plusEconomasE to provide 0.3 mg Se/kg DM (ESe3, n = 6). Samples collected at week 0and 12 were analyzed for serum Se and middle gluteal glutathione peroxidase (GPx)and mitochondrial enzyme activities by kinetic colorimetry and mitochondrialcapacities by high-resolution respirometry. Data were analyzed using mixed linearmodels in SAS v9.4 with repeated measures (time) and fixed effects of time, diet,and time x diet; horse(diet) served as a random effect. Serum Se tended toincrease in all horses by week 12 (P = 0.08) but was unaffected by diet. MuscleGPx activity remained similar among all horses throughout the duration of thestudy. Mitochondrial volume density (citrate synthase [CS] activity), integrativefunction (cytochrome c oxidase [CCO] activity per mg protein), and integrative(per mg tissue) oxidative (P) and electron transfer (E) capacities increased fromweek 0 to 12 in all horses (P </= 0.01). Intrinsic (relative to CS) CCO activity decreased in all horses (P = 0.001), while intrinsic P and E capacities decreasedonly in ESe1 horses from week 0 to 12 (P </= 0.002). These results suggest thatfeeding EconomasE to provide 0.3 mg Se/kg DM may prevent adverse effects ofremoving 100 IU dietary vitE/kg DM on mitochondria in young horses. More researchis needed to determine optimal dietary Se and vitE levels in performance horsesto maximize mitochondrial energy production.

OAB - Mitochondria, colloquially referred to as the powerhouses of the cell, areessential for sustained energy production, which is particularly important forathletic performance. During exercise, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are producedas a normal byproduct of muscle contraction. ROS act as critical signalingmolecules and are essential to stimulate adaptation to exercise and otherstressors. However, if excess ROS are produced and not sequestered byantioxidants, they may damage cellular components such as lipids, proteins, andDNA. Selenium (Se) and vitamin E (vitE) are two primary dietary antioxidants thataid in quenching excess ROS. To evaluate the impact of Se and vitE onmitochondria, three diets differing in Se and vitE levels were provided tolightly exercising young horses for 12 wk. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial capacitywas negatively impacted by the reduction of dietary vitE, which was rescued with elevated dietary Se. The results highlight the importance of determining optimal levels of minerals and vitamins in performance horse diets to ensure properenergy production during exercise.

TI  - Effect of combined maternal and post-hatch dietary 25-hydroxycholecalciferolsupplementation on broiler chicken Pectoralis major muscle growth characteristicsand satellite cell mitotic activity.
LID - skac192 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jas/skac192 [doi]
AB  - Skeletal muscle growth is largely dependent on the proliferation anddifferentiation of muscle-specific stem cells known as satellite cells (SC).Previous work has shown that dietary inclusion of the vitamin D3 metabolite,25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25OHD3), also called calcidiol, can promote skeletalmuscle growth in post-hatch broiler chickens. Improving vitamin D status ofbroiler breeder hens by feeding 25OHD3 in addition to vitamin D3 has also beenshown to positively impact progeny. Yet, whether combined pre- and post-hatchsupplementation with 25OHD3 produces an additive or synergistic SC-mediated,skeletal muscle growth response remains unanswered. To evaluate the effect ofcombined maternal and post-hatch dietary 25OHD3 supplementation on the growth andSC mitotic activity of the Pectoralis major (PM) muscles in broiler chickens, arandomized complete block design experiment with the main effects of maternaldiet (MDIET) and post-hatch diet (PDIET) arranged in a 2 x 2 factorial treatment structure was conducted. From 25 to 36 wk of age, broiler breeder hens were fed 1of 2 MDIET formulated to provide 5,000 IU D3 (MCTL) or 2,240 IU of D3 + 2,760 IU of 25OHD3 per kg of feed (M25OHD3). Their male broiler chick offspring (n = 400) hatched from eggs collected from 35 to 36 wk of age were reared in raised floorpens. Broilers were fed 1 of 2 PDIET formulated to provide 5,000 IU of D3 per kg of feed (PCTL) or 2,240 IU of D3 + 2,760 IU of 25OHD3 per kg of feed (P25OHD3).Muscle was collected at days 4, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and stored untilimmunofluorescence analysis. Data were analyzed as a 2-way ANOVA with SASGLIMMIX. Dietary 25OHD3 was effectively transferred from hen plasma to egg yolks (P = 0.002) and to broiler progeny plasma (days 4 to 22; P </= 0.044). Including 25OHD3 in either MDIET or PDIET altered PM hypertrophic growth prior to day 29 (P>/= 0.001) and tended to reduce Wooden Breast severity (P </= 0.089). Mitotic SC populations were increased in PM of MCTL:P25OHD3 and M25OHD:PCTL-fed broilers at d 4 (P = 0.037). At d 8, the PM mitotic SC populations were increased 33% byP25OHD3 (P = 0.054). The results of this study reveal that combined maternal and post-hatch 25OHD3 supplementation does not produce additive or synergisticeffects on SC-mediated broiler muscle growth. However, vitamin D statusimprovement through dietary 25OHD3 inclusion in either the maternal or post-hatchdiet stimulated broiler breast muscle growth by increasing proliferating SCpopulations.

Overall, this work answers not onlypractical questions for the broiler industry regarding the possible benefits ofcombining maternal and post-hatch dietary 25OHD3 supplementation but alsoimproves our understanding of vitamin D's role in pre- and post-hatch broilerskeletal muscle growth.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of in ovo injection ofhigh-yield broiler embryos with nicotinamide riboside (NR) on pectoralis majormuscle (PMM) development, growth, and gene expression. Fertilized Cobb 700broiler eggs were randomly assigned to one of four treatments within a 2 x 2factorial design. Factor 1 consisted of NR dose (DOS) with eggs receiving 0 or2.5 mM NR. Factor 2 consisted of injection location (LOC), with treatmentsinjected into either the yolk sac or albumen. At day 10 of incubation, 100 muL ofthe assigned NR dose was injected into the yolk sac of the developing embryo and chicks were euthanized within 24 h of hatching. Chick PMM and individual fibermorphometrics, and expression of genes associated with cell cycle progressionwere analyzed. There were DOS x LOC interactions for hatched chick PM weight and length (P < 0.04). When NR was injected into the albumen, PMM weight decreased (P< 0.05); when NR was injected into the yolk, PMM weight increased (P < 0.05).Pectoralis major length was not affected (P > 0.05) when NR was injected into thealbumen but was increased (P < 0.05) when NR was injected into the yolk. Therewas a DOS x LOC interaction (P = 0.04) for muscle fiber density and tended to be a DOS x LOC interaction (P = 0.07) for muscle fiber CSA. Pectoralis major muscle fiber density was not affected when NR was injected into the albumen (P > 0.05), but density increased when NR was injected into the yolk (P < 0.05). There wereDOS x LOC interactions for hatched chick COXII, cyclin D, and SIRT1 expression (P</= 0.04), which may indicate NR improves skeletal muscle development and growth by enhancing myoblast proliferation during embryonic development.

OAB - Broiler chicken weight gain is a result of genetics and nutrition, with increasedmuscle mass attributed to accelerated embryonic myogenesis and posthatch musclegrowth. During the avian incubation period, in ovo injection may be used as astrategy to deliver exogenous supplements into growing embryos for improvingskeletal muscle development and growth. Nicotinamide riboside (NR), a vitamin B3 analog, is a human performance supplement used to stimulate mitochondriabiogenesis and elevate tissue NAD+ levels. Research showed injecting NR into the chick embryonic yolk sac increased breast muscle weight and muscle satellite cellnumbers and proliferation rate. Therefore, our objective was to determine theeffects of in ovo injection of high-yield broilers with NR on broiler breastmuscle development and growth. Our study showed in ovo injection of NR into theyolk sac increased hatched chick breast muscle morphometrics, which coincidedwith an increase in muscle fiber density and tended to decrease fibercross-sectional area. Increased Sirtuin1 and cyclin D mRNA expression of hatched chicks from eggs injected with 2.5 mM NR into yolk sac indicate a potential NRregulated Sirtuin1/cyclin D molecular mechanism mediating chicken muscle earlydevelopment.

AB  - Leucaena leucocephala growing in the tropics and subtropics serves as potentialforage for livestock because its foliage is rich in protein, fiber, and minerals.However, its use for livestock feed has been hindered by toxic nonprotein aminoacid mimosine. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a method to reduce oreliminate mimosine from foliage. A previous study found that the fermentation of L. leucocephala foliage reduced the mimosine content and prompted the authors to isolate potent mimosine degrading microorganisms and characterize the mimosinase for the complete elimination of mimosine in the L. leucocephala foliage. The soilscreening of the L. leucocephala tree surroundings led to the isolation ofArthrobacter sp. Ryudai-S1, which can degrade and assimilate mimosine as anitrogen and carbon source. Mimosinase in this strain was found to bethermostable and showed strong activity. Docking model's inspection and theinteraction energy calculation between mimosine-pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP)complex and the active site of this enzyme identified 11 important amino acidresidues that stabilized the binding. Of these amino acid residues, mutationexperiment suggested that Tyr-263' and Phe-34 stabilizes the substrate bindingand play a critical role in guiding the substrate to proper positions toaccomplish high catalytic efficacy and selectivity. These observations suggestthat Arthrobacter sp. Ryudai-S1 could be potentially useful for the developmentof L. leucocephala feed with reduced mimosine content.

AB  - Hypercalcemia is a rare condition in pregnancy. It is most commonly caused byprimary hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid hormone-related peptid(PTHrP)-producing malignant tumours, less frequently by increased intestinalcalcium absorption, vitamin D intoxication, milk-alkali syndrome, andgranulomatous diseases or lymphomas, in which vitamin D 1alpha-hydroxylaseexpression is increased. Rarely, gestational hypercalcaemia may be caused by adisorder of vitamin D catabolism caused by loss-of-function mutations in theCYP24A1 gene. We report the case of a 34-year-old Caucasian female patient. Shewas diagnosed with hypercalcaemia, normal intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level and lower left parathyroid adenoma. Investigations for malignancy showed noevidence of abnormality. The lower-left parathyroid adenoma was removed followed by cessation of hypercalcaemia. Fifteen months later, she had a spontaneousmiscarriage at a gestational age of 8 weeks, when serum calcium was at the upper limit of normal. 25 months following parathyroid surgery, as a 12-week pregnant, our patient manifested with symptomatic, PTH-independent hypercalcaemia.25-hydroxy-vitamin-D and PTHrP were within reference ranges while 1,25(OH)2Dlevel was clearly elevated. Compound heterozygosity within the CYP24A1 gene wasconfirmed. By conservative treatment, no other complications were observed duringpregnancy, and she finally gave birth to a healthy girl with a term. We presentthe difficulties of diagnosing and treating hypercalcaemia observed duringpregnancy. According to our knowledge, our patient represents the first case ofCYP24A1 gene defect diagnosed in Hungary. Orv Hetil. 2022; 163(31): 1237-1242.

PG  - 13093

AB  - Vitamin C (Vit C) is an essential micronutrient and antioxidant for human health.Unfortunately, Vit C cannot be produced in humans and is ingested through dietwhile severe deficiencies can lead to scurvy. However, consumption is ofteninconsistent, and foods vary in Vit C concentrations. Biofortification, thepractice of increasing micronutrient or mineral concentrations, can improve thenutritional quality of crops and allow for more consistent dietary levels ofthese nutrients. Of the three leading biofortification practices (i.e.,conventional, transgenic, and agronomical), the least explored approach toincrease Vit C in microgreens is agronomically, especially through thesupplemental application of ascorbic acid. In this study, biofortification of VitC in microgreens through supplemental ascorbic acid was attempted and provenachievable. Arugula (Eruca sativa 'Astro') microgreens were irrigated with fourconcentrations of ascorbic acid and a control. Total Vit C (T-AsA) and ascorbicacid increased in microgreens as supplementary concentrations increased. Inconclusion, biofortification of Vit C in microgreens through supplementalascorbic acid is achievable, and consumption of these bio-fortified microgreenscould help fulfill the daily Vit C requirements for humans, thereby reducing the need for supplemental vitamins.

TI  - Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 autoantibody(ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj)-associated autoimmune cerebellar ataxia, encephalitis andperipheral neuropathy: review of the literature.
PG  - 196
LID - 10.1186/s12974-022-02545-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 2014, we first described novel autoantibodies to the inositol1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj) in patients withautoimmune cerebellar ataxia (ACA) in this journal. Here, we provide a review of the available literature on ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj, covering clinical and paraclinicalpresentation, tumour association, serological findings, and immunopathogenesis.METHODS: Review of the peer-reviewed and PubMed-listed English languageliterature on ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj. In addition, we provide an illustrative reporton a new patient with ITPR1-IgG-associated encephalitis with cognitive declineand psychosis. RESULTS: So far, at least 31 patients with serum ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sjhave been identified (clinical information available for 21). The most commonmanifestations were ACA, encephalopathy with seizures, myelopathy, and(radiculo)neuropathy, including autonomic neuropathy. In 45% of cases, anunderlying tumour was present, making the condition a facultative paraneoplastic neurological disorder. The neurological syndrome preceded tumour diagnosis in allbut one case. In most cases, immunotherapy had only moderate or no effect. Theassociation of ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj with manifestations other than ACA iscorroborated by the case of a 48-year-old woman with high-titre ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sjantibodies and rapid cognitive decline, affecting memory, attention and executivefunction, and psychotic manifestations, including hallucinations, investigatedhere in detail. FDG-PET revealed right-temporal glucose hypermetabolismcompatible with limbic encephalitis. Interestingly, ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj mainlybelonged to the IgG2 subclass in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in thisand further patients, while it was predominantly IgG1 in other patients,including those with more severe outcome, and remained detectable over the entirecourse of disease. Immunotherapy with intravenous methylprednisolone, plasmaexchange, and intravenous immunoglobulins, was repeatedly followed by partial or complete recovery. Long-term treatment with cyclophosphamide was paralleled byrelative stabilization, although the patient noted clinical worsening at the end of each treatment cycle. CONCLUSIONS: The spectrum of neurological manifestationsassociated with ITPR1 autoimmunity is broader than initially thought.Immunotherapy may be effective in some cases. Studies evaluating the frequency ofITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj in patients with cognitive decline and/or psychosis of unknown aetiology are warranted. Tumour screening is essential in patients presentingwith ITPR1-IgG/anti-Sj.

TI  - Neglected vitamin K deficiency causing coagulation dysfunction in an olderpatient with pneumonia: a case report.
PG  - 628
LID - 10.1186/s12877-022-03327-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The development of coagulation disorders can be dangerous and fatalin the older people, especially those with multiple medical conditions. VitaminK-dependent coagulation disorders are easily overlooked when anticoagulant drugs are not used and the patient shows no signs of bleeding. CASE PRESENTATION: Wereport a case of a 71-year-old male suffering from pulmonary infection withsevere coagulation disorder without bleeding symptoms. He also had a history ofParkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and cardiac insufficiency. Coagulationtests were normal at the time of admission, prothrombin time (PT) is 13.9(normal, 9.5-13.1) seconds and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT)is 30.2 (normal, 25.1-36.5) seconds. But it turned severely abnormal after 20days (PT: 136.1 s, APTT: 54.8 s). However, no anticoagulants such as warfarin wasused and no bleeding symptoms were observed. Subsequent mixing studies withnormal plasma showed a decrease in prothrombin times. Vitamin K deficiency wasthought to be the cause of coagulation disorders considering long-term antibiotictherapy, especially cephalosporins, inadequate diet and abnormal liver function. After supplementation with 20 mg of vitamin K, coagulation dysfunction wasrescued the next day and serious consequences were effectively prevented.CONCLUSIONS: Overall, timely vitamin K supplementation with antimicrobials thataffect vitamin K metabolism requires clinician attention, especially in olderpatients who are multimorbid, frail or nutritionally compromised, and areadmitted to hospital because of an infection that needs antimicrobial therapy areat risk of clotting disorders due to abnormal vitamin K metabolism secondary toaltered gut flora, which can exacerbate existing nutritional deficiencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An inverse association between vitamin D status and cardiometabolicrisk has been reported but this relationship may have been affected by residualconfounding from adiposity and physical activity due to imprecise measures ofthese variables. We aimed to investigate the relationship between serum25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and cardiometabolic risk factors, with adjustmentfor objectively-measured physical activity and adiposity. METHODS: This was apopulation-based cross-sectional study in 586 adults in Cameroon (63.5% women).We assessed markers of glucose homoeostasis (fasting blood glucose (BG), 2 h postglucose load BG, HOMA-IR)) and computed a metabolic syndrome score by summing thesex-specific z-scores of five risk components measuring central adiposity, blood pressure, glucose, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides. RESULTS: Mean+/-SD age was 38.3 +/- 8.6 years, and serum 25(OH)D was 51.7 +/- 12.5 nmol/L. Mean 25(OH)D was higher in rural (53.4 +/- 12.8 nmol/L) than urban residents (50.2 +/- 12.1nmol/L), p = 0.002. The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency (<50 nmol/L) was45.7%. There was an inverse association between 25(OH)D and the metabolicsyndrome score in unadjusted analyses (beta = -0.30, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.05),which became non-significant after adjusting for age, sex, smoking status,alcohol intake and education level. Serum 25(OH)D was inversely associated withfasting BG (-0.21, -0.34 to -0.08)), which remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, education, smoking, alcohol intake, the season of data collection, BMI and physical activity (-0.17, -0.29 to -0.06). There was an inverseassociation of 25(OH)D with 2-h BG (-0.20, -0.34 to -0.05) and HOMA-IR (-0.12,-0.19 to -0.04) in unadjusted analysis, but these associations becamenon-significant after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSION: Vitamin Dinsufficiency was common in this population. This study showed an inverseassociation between vitamin D status and fasting glucose that was independent of potential confounders, including objectively measured physical activity andadiposity, suggesting a possible mechanism through insulin secretion.

AB  - Two Gram-stain-positive, aerobic, chemoheterotrophic, non-motile, rod-shaped, andyellow-pigmented bacterial strains, designated IMCC34837(T) and IMCC34838(T),were isolated from a freshwater stream. Results of 16S rRNA gene-basedphylogenetic analyses showed that strains IMCC34837(T) and IMCC34838(T) shared96.3% sequence similarity and were most closely related to Flavihumibacterprofundi Chu64-6-1(T) (99.6%) and Flavihumibacter cheonanensis WS16(T) (96.4%),respectively. Complete whole-genome sequences of strains IMCC34837(T) andIMCC34838(T) were 5.0 Mbp and 4.3 Mbp of genome size with 44.5% and 47.9% of DNA G + C contents, respectively. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA- DNA hybridization (dDDH) values between the two strains were 70.0% and 17.9%,repectively, revealing that they are independent species. The two strains showed </= 75.2% ANI and </= 19.3% dDDH values to each closely related species of thegenus Flavihumibacter, indicating that the two strains represent each novelspecies. Major fatty acid constituents of strain IMCC34837(T) were iso-C15:0,iso-C15:1 G and anteiso-C15:0 and those of strain IMCC34838(T) were iso-C15:0 andiso-C15:1 G. The predominant isoprenoid quinone detected in both strains wasmenaquinone-7 (MK-7). Major polar lipids of both strains werephosphatidylethanolamine, aminolipids, and glycolipids. Based on the phylogeneticand phenotypic characterization, strains IMCC34837(T) and IMCC34838(T) wereconsidered to represent two novel species within the genus Flavihumibacter, forwhich the names Flavihumibacter fluminis sp. nov. and Flavihumibacter rivuli sp. nov. are proposed with IMCC34837(T) (= KACC 21752(T) = NBRC 115292(T)) andIMCC34838(T) (= KACC 21753(T) = NBRC 115293(T)) as the type strains,respectively.

TI  - Association between MTHFR polymorphism and seizure control in epileptic patients with hyperhomocysteinaemia
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1684/epd.2022.1470 [doi]
AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate possible associations betweenMTHFR polymorphism and seizure control of epileptic patients withhyperhomocysteinaemia. Methods: A total of 81 epileptic patients withhyperhomocysteinaemia treated with oxcarbazepine monotherapy were enrolled inthis study. All patients were offered vitamin B supplementation (2.5 mg/d folate and 1.5 mg/d mecobalamine) for six months. MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms, serum homocysteine, folate and vitamin B12 levels as well as seizure frequencyand score based on the Hamilton depression scale (HAMD) were evaluated atbaseline and after six months of follow-up. Results: Spearman correlationanalysis showed that the extent of decline of seizure frequency positivelycorrelated with a dynamic change in serum homocysteine concentration betweenbaseline and after six months of follow-up (t=0.241, p=0.015 [Spearman'scoefficient]). For the MTHFR C677T polymorphism, compared to the CC genotype, theTT genotype was associated with a significant downtrend of homocysteine (19.69 vs10.28 mmol/L, p=0.006) and uptrend of folate (6.21 vs 2.49 ng/mL; p=0.004). Thedecrease in homocysteine (17.94 vs 12.52 mmol/L, p=0.001) and increase of folate (5.08 vs 2.86 ng/mL; p=0.003) were significantly greater in patients with the Tallele compared to those with the C allele. Also, the TT genotype (2.33 vs 1.4,p=0.056) and T allele (1.95 vs 1.38, p=0.037) were associated with a greaterdecrease in seizure frequency compared to the CC genotype or C allele. The A1298Cpolymorphism alone was not associated with elevated homocysteine or decreasedfolate levels at baseline, and showed little association with response to vitaminB supplementation in epileptic patients with hyperhomocysteinaemia. However, inpatients with combined 677TT/1298AA or 677TT/1298AC polymorphisms, the changes inhomocysteine and folate levels and seizure frequency were more obvious.Significance: MTHFR C677T polymorphism was associated with seizure control inepileptic patients with hyperhomocysteinaemia; individuals with the 677TTgenotype or T allele demonstrated better seizure control.

TI  - A Pilot Pre and Post 4 Week Intervention Evaluating the Effect of a Proprietary, Powdered, Plant Based Food on Micronutrient Status, Dietary Intake, and Markersof Health in a Healthy Adult Population.
PG  - 945622
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.945622 [doi]
AB  - Background: A "balanced, adequate, and varied diet" is recommended as the basisof nutritionally sound diet by the World Health Organisation and national public health agencies. Huel is a proprietary, on-the-go, powdered, plant based food,providing all 26 essential vitamins and minerals, protein, essential fats,carbohydrate, fibre, and phytonutrients. Objectives: Assessing the effect ofsolely consuming Huel on micronutrient status, dietary intake and markers ofhealth was achieved through a 4-week intervention of solely Huel powder. Methods:Habitual energy intake was assessed through a one-week lead in period withhealthy adult participants (aged 18 or over) logging their food intake, afterwhich only Huel was consumed for 4 weeks. Blood samples and body composition was assessed before and after the lead in week as well the end of the intervention.Thirty participants were recruited with 20 (11 females, median age 31, range22-44) completing the study, 19 sets of blood samples were collected. 22 bloodmarkers were analysed along with weight, BMI, waist circumference, visceraladipose tissue (VAT), and body composition. All blood micronutrients, except for Thyroid Stimulating Hormone and choline were sent to Royal Victoria InfirmaryNHS, Newcastle Laboratory (Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom) for analysis.Results: Fourteen of the parameters significantly changed over the course of the study with circulating haemoglobin, iron, vitamins B12 and D as well as selenium significantly increasing (p < 0.05). HbA1c, total and non-HDL cholesterol,vitamins A and E, potassium, BMI, VAT, and waist circumference all significantly decreased (p < 0.05) post intervention. Conclusion: Although energy intakedecreased during the intervention period, the adherence to recommendedmicronutrient intake, as quantified by the dietary Total Adherence Score,significantly increased which tallies with the preservation or improvement ofmicronutrient status. This study potentially demonstrates that consuming onlyHuel for 4 weeks does not negatively affect micronutrient status.

AB  - The use of scientific evidence to support the process of formulating andimplementing public policies might be biased by studies funded by thepharmaceutical and food industry, which more often than not meet corporateinterests. This review aimed to analyze the occurrence of conflict of interest(COI) in academic production regarding vitamin D and COVID-19, considering thefacility offered during the pandemic for academic publications of heterogeneousquality. A scoping review of observational studies published in Medline, Lilacs, and Google Scholar databases was carried out. The selected studies were publishedbetween December 2019 and August 2021, focused on the relationship betweenvitamin D and prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in non-institutionalizedindividuals, with no language restrictions. Twenty-nine studies met eligibilitycriteria. COI was disclosed in five papers and further identified by reviewauthors in eight other papers, meaning COI was present in thirteen papers(44.8%). Studies were funded by companies in the diagnostics, pharmaceutical and food sectors. Conclusions favorable to vitamin D supplementation were moreprevalent in papers where COI was identified (9/13, 69.2%) than among paperswhere COI was not found (4/16, 25.0%). Omissions of disclosure of COI, fundingsource, and sponsor functions were observed. The identification of possiblecorporate political activities in scientific papers about vitamin D publishedduring the COVID-19 pandemic signals a need for greater transparency andguideline development on the prevention of COI in scientific production.

COIS- Among included studies, five reported COI with industries (42, 44, 49, 51, 53)and 24 reported absence of COI or did not report on COI (25-41, 43, 45-48, 50,52). After analyzing the funding section as well as other papers published byauthors in 2020 and 2021, eight studies were found to have ties with industries(25, 26, 28, 33, 36, 38, 46, 48), totaling 13 studies (44.8% of the sample) whereCOI was identified. In addition to COI, other CPA were evaluated. No "strikingtitles" were identified. No attempt to discredit other studies was identifiedeither. Regarding the reporting of limitations and bias, only one study (33) did not objectively report on it. Exposures and outcomes were considered adequate to respond each study's questions. However, in eight of the 29 studies (25, 26,30-33, 42, 51) authors suggested supplementation of vitamin D for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 in the conclusion, even though this was not one of thestudy's stated aims. Of these eight studies which support vitamin Dsupplementation unsupported by their own data, five (62.5%) were identified ashaving COI (25, 26, 33, 42, 51). The flowchart of the identification of COI andCPA situations is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2Conflict of Interest and CorporatePolitical Activities identification flowchart.Diagnostics-, pharmaceuticals- and food- companies were the source of COI in the analyzed papers. A relationshipwith diagnostic industry was observed in five of the 13 studies (42, 44, 46, 48, 53), seven of the studies had COI due to their links with the pharmaceuticalindustry (25, 26, 28, 33, 36, 38, 51), while one study had ties to bothpharmaceutical and food industries (49) (Table 2).

Authors of two of these studies (39, 41) statedthat the sponsoring company did not play a role in the selection ormethodological evaluation of the included studies, nor in the interpretation ofthe results or conclusions reached. No COI were identified in 16 studies in thesample. Of these, 12 acknowledge funding via grants from governments,universities or academic research centers (25, 27, 31, 33-35, 37, 41, 43, 45, 47,52) and three studies explicitly stated that there had been no sources of fundingand no sponsorships (30, 40, 50). One study did not mention whether or notfunding was available (32). In studies where COI was identified, the chance of a conclusion recommending vitamin D supplementation for the prevention or treatmentof COVID-19 was higher than among studies where COI was not identified [OR: 6.75 (1.32, 34.57)]. In the whole sample, most of the studies (16/29, 55.2%) concludedthat vitamin D was not associated with the prevention or treatment of COVID-19(28, 29, 33, 34, 37-41, 43-45, 47, 48, 50, 52). Among independent studies, theprevalence of a lack of association was even higher (12/16, 75.0%). Regarding thestudies where COI was identified (25, 26, 33, 36, 42, 46, 49, 51, 53), themajority concluded in favor of an association between vitamin D and prevention ortreatment of COVID-19 (9/13, 69.2%, p = 0.027), as described in Table 3.

AB  - Objective: Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) refers to the complete or partial lackof pituitary growth hormone synthesis and secretion. This study is aimed atinvestigating the efficacy of vitamin D and recombinant human growth hormone(rhGH) in children with GHD. Methods: A total of 100 children with GHD at ourhospital were included between 1(st) January 2018 and 31(st) October 2020. Thepatients were divided into a study group (n = 70, received vitamin D combinedwith rhGH) and a control group (n = 30, received rhGH). The growth anddevelopment (bone age, growth rate, and height), bone metabolism (bone alkalinephosphatase (BAP), beta-collagen degradation product (beta-CTX), osteocalcin(OC), and amino-terminal propeptide type I procollagen (PINP)), insulin-likegrowth factor 1 (IGF-1), ghrelin, and adverse reactions in the two groups weremeasured before and 12 months after treatment. Results: There were no significantdifferences in the bone age, growth rate, and height between the two groupsbefore treatment. After 12 months of treatment, the bone age, growth rate, andheight of the study group were significantly higher than those of the controlgroup. After 12 months of treatment, the levels of serum BAP, PINP, and OC in thestudy group were significantly higher than those in the control group, while the levels of beta-CTX in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group. The serum IGF-1 level in the study group was significantly higher than that in the control group, while the ghrelin level in the study group waslower. There was no significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups. Conclusion: Combined rhGH and vitamin D treatment canpromote growth and development, improve bone metabolism, and regulate IGF-1 andghrelin levels.

AB  - Crassocephalum rubens and Crassocephalum crepidioides are plant species native toAfrica, but grow in most tropical and subtropical regions of the world. They are rich in vitamins, minerals, and essential oils and are traditional leafyvegetables and medicinal plants in Sub-Saharan Africa. The plants are stillmainly collected from the wild but shall be taken into cultivation and animportant aim in the domestication of these species is to improve traits that arerelevant for crop production. Here, seed formation and germination capacities in C. crepidioides and C. rubens were investigated, and it was found that C.crepidioides exhibits a higher level of seed dormancy, which could be broken withlight, and was correlated with higher amounts of abscisic acid (ABA), a planthormone that promotes seed dormancy. ABA is also very well-known for its role in abiotic stress tolerance, and it is shown that tetraploid C. crepidioidesexhibits a higher level of resistance against drought and heat stress thandiploid C. rubens, traits that will benefit the cultivation of these plants,particularly in rain-fed cropping systems. The potential of Crassocephalum toimprove nutrition and increase the resilience of marginal cropping systems inAfrica is discussed.

AB  - Ejaculate quality can be regarded as multifactorial, with nutrition being afactor that could directly influence sperm parameters. The present study aimed toevaluate seminal quality associated with seasonal fat-soluble vitaminsupplementation of boars. Seven sexually mature boars were randomly allotted toone of the three groups, and fed one of the three supplementary diets for 32weeks: (1) control treatment (COD), without supplementation of fat-solublevitamins, (2) treatment containing 100% fat-soluble vitamin supplementationadministered intramuscularly, which was based on fat soluble vitaminsupplementation (A, D3, E) (FVD1), and (3) treatment containing 50% offat-soluble vitamin supplementation (FVD 1 2 ). Semen was collected at 7-dayintervals. Semen samples were analyzed to assess several sperm parameters usingthe Computer-Assisted Semen Analysis (CASA) ISAS((R))v1 system. Results showedthat groups receiving FVD1 and FVD 1 2 supplementation had an increased semenvolume. The percentages of motile and progressively motile sperm were increasedby FVD1 treatment. A statistically significant interaction between treatment and season was found in the percentage of motility and progressive motility (p <0.05). Sperm concentrations showed significant differences (p < 0.05) betweentreatments. Velocity variables (VSL, VCL, and VAP) were higher (p < 0.05) inboars that received fat-soluble vitamin supplementation in comparison to controlsreceiving no supplementation. The FVD1 treatment presented spermatozoa withgreater head size and more elongated heads (p < 0.05). Overall, the utilizationof dietary fat-soluble vitamin supplementation significantly improved the semenquality of boar ejaculates. This highlights the importance of fat-soluble vitaminsupplementation in sexually active boars.

This study mappedgeospatial patterns underlying VAS coverage across two policy-relevantadministrative unit levels (states and districts) in India. The relationshipbetween spatial distribution of VAS coverage and vitamin A deficiency (VAD)prevalence was also investigated. METHODS: The study draws on nationallyrepresentative cross-sectional data collected during National Family and HealthSurvey 4 (NFHS-4) and Comprehensive National Nutritional Survey (CNNS). VAScoverage was estimated using information obtained during NFHS-4 from mothersabout whether their children (n=204 645) had received VAS within 6 months of the survey. VAD prevalence estimates were based on serum retinol measurements during CNNS in under-five children (n=9563). State-level and district-level choroplethmaps of VAS coverage were constructed. Spatial patterns were probed using Moran'sstatistics, scatter plots and local indicators of spatial association (LISA).Relationship between VAS coverage (as an explanatory variable) and VAD prevalencewas explored using spatial autoregressive models. RESULTS: VAS coverage in India (overall 60.5%) ranged from 29.5% (Nagaland) to 89.5% (Goa) across the variousstates/union territories. Among districts, it ranged from 12.8% (Longlengdistrict, Nagaland) to 94.5% (Kolar district, Karnataka). The coverage exhibited positive spatial autocorrelation, more prominently at the district-level(univariate Moran's I=0.638, z-value=25.614, pseudo p value=0.001). LISA mapsidentified spatial clusters of high coverage and low coverage districts. Nosignificant spatial association was observed between VAS coverage and VADprevalence in the states during spatial error (R(2)=0.07, lambda=0.30, pvalue=0.14) and spatial lag (R(2)=0.05, rho=0.25, p value=0.23) regression.CONCLUSION: Two out of every five eligible Indian children were not supplemented with vitamin A. The coverage was geographically heterogeneous with discerniblespatial patterns. Their consequences on vitamin A status and associated healtheffects in the community deserve close monitoring.

AB  - COVID-19 is a rapidly spreading disease, which has caught the world by surprise. Millions of people suffer from illness, and the mortality rates are dramatically high. Currently, there is no specific and immediate treatment for this disease.Remedies are limited to supportive regiments and few antiviral andanti-inflammatory drugs. The lack of a definite cure for COVID-19 is the reasonbehind its high mortality and global prevalence. COVID-19 can lead to a critical illness with severe respiratory distress and cytokine release. Increasedoxidative stress and excessive production of inflammatory cytokines are vitalcomponents of severe COVID-19. Micronutrients, metalloids, and vitamins such asiron, manganese, selenium, Zinc, Copper, vitamin A, B family, and C are among theessential and trace elements that play a pivotal role in human nutrition andhealth. They participate in metabolic processes that lead to energy production.In addition, they support immune functions and act as antioxidants. Therefore,maintaining an optimal level of micronutrients intake, particularly those withantioxidant activities, is essential to fight against oxidative stress, modulate inflammation, and boost the immune system. Therefore, these factors could play a crucial role in COVID-19 prevention and treatment. In this review, we aimed tosummarize antiviral properties of different vitamins and minerals. Moreover, wewill investigate the correlation between them and their effects in COVID-19patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An utmost increase of breast cancer burden during the last severaldecades was reported in Asian countries. Findings from literature confirm thatrisk factors of breast cancers can be modifiable and non-modifiable in nature.OBJECTIVE: The present study is designed to identify specific modifiable andnon-modifiable risk factors associated with breast cancer. METHODS: A matchedcase-control study was conducted considering 187 cases as women diagnosed withbreast cancer and 187 hospital-controls as women without having breast cancervisiting the hospital. Other than standard risk factors, stress is measured usingPerceived Stress Scale (PSS) and stress is measured using Pittsburgh SleepQuality Index (PSQI). Several modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors wereassessed using conditional logistic regression to find out significantassociation with breast cancer. RESULTS: Regular multi-vitamin uptake (OR = 3.38;95%CI = 1.69 - 6.77; p-value = 0.001), poor sleep (OR = 11.29; 95%CI = 4.36 -29.25; p-value < 0.001), irregular sleep (OR = 34.11; 95%CI = 10.03 - 115.92;p-value < 0.001) and severe stress (OR = 6.74; 95%CI = 3.06 - 14.81; p-value <0.001) were found to be the highest odds ratio among all modifiable risk factorof breast cancer. Also, age at first childbirth less than 30 years (OR = 0.44;95%CI = 0.25 - 0.78; p-value = 0.005) was found protective against breast cancer.CONCLUSION: In our study, stress, sleeping pattern, and regular multi-vitaminuptake were found to be significant modifiable risk factors of breast cancer.None of the non-modifiable risk factors were found to be significantly associatedwith the risk of breast cancer.

TI  - NXP031 prevents dopaminergic neuronal loss and oxidative damage in theAAV-WT-alpha-synuclein mouse model of Parkinson's disease.
PG  - e0272085
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272085 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized byinclusions of aggregated alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn). Oxidative stress plays acritical role in nigrostriatal degeneration and is responsible for alpha-Synaggregation in PD. Vitamin C or ascorbic acid acts as an effective antioxidant toprevent free radical damage. However, vitamin C is easily oxidized and oftenloses its physiological activity, limiting its therapeutic potential. Theobjective of this study was to evaluate whether NXP031, a new compound wedeveloped consisting of Aptamin C and Vitamin C, is neuroprotective againstalpha-synucleinopathy. To model alpha-Syn induced PD, we stereotacticallyinjected AAV particles overexpressing human alpha-Syn into the substantia nigra(SN) of mice. One week after AAV injection, NXP031 was administered via oralgavage every day for eight weeks. We found that oral administration of NXP031ameliorated motor deficits measured by the rotarod test and prevented the loss ofnigral dopaminergic neurons caused by WT-alpha-Syn overexpression in the SN.Also, NXP031 blocked the propagation of aggregated alpha-Syn into the hippocampusby alleviating oxidative stress. These results indicate that NXP031 can be apotential therapeutic for PD.

LID - 10.1017/S0007114522002446 [doi]
AB  - The transfer of one-carbon units between molecules in metabolic pathways isessential for maintaining cellular homeostasis, but little is known about whetherthe circulating concentrations of metabolites involved in the one-carbonmetabolism are affected by the prandial status. Epidemiological studies do notalways consistently use fasting or non-fasting blood samples, or may lackinformation on the prandial status of the study participants. Therefore, the mainaim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a light breakfast onserum concentrations of selected metabolites and B-vitamins related to theone-carbon metabolism; i.e., the methionine-homocysteine cycle, the folate cycle,the choline oxidation pathway, and the transsulfuration pathway. Sixty-threehealthy adults (36 women) with BMI >/=27 kg/m(2) were included in the study.Blood was collected in the fasting state and 60 and 120 minutes after intake of astandardised breakfast consisting of white bread, margarine, white cheese,strawberry jam and orange juice (2218 kJ). The meal contained low amounts ofcholine, betaine, serine, and vitamins B2, B3, B6, B9 and B12. Serumconcentrations of total homocysteine, total cysteine, flavin mononucleotide,nicotinamide and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate were significantly decreased, andconcentrations of choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, sarcosine, cystathionine andfolate were significantly increased following breakfast intake (P < 0.05). Ourfindings demonstrate that intake of a light breakfast with low nutrient contentaffected serum concentrations of several metabolites and B-vitamins related tothe one-carbon metabolism.

TI  - [Vitamin D like one of few prevention possibilities for autoimmune diseases?]
LID - D6894 [pii]
AB  - Data from elderly Americans of an age of >/=50 years that were included in alarge nationwide, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prevention trial, show that vitamin D supplementation, alone or in combination with omega-3 fattyacids, reduces autoimmune disease risk with 22%. These Americans were treatedwith 2000 IU/day cholecalciferol (vitamin D) for a period of 5 years alone or in combination with 1g/day omega-3 fatty acids. Both treatments resulted in asignificant reduction of the incidence of autoimmune diseases. The findings were more pronounced after two years after the start of the supplementation. Having a lower body index seems to be beneficial for the vitamin D effects. The questionis via which pathophysiological mechanism(s) does vitamin D work. More and moreof the secrets of the effects of vitamin D on the immune system and in particularon T cells are becoming identified and this study motivates to dig further.

AB  - The vertebrate sodium-iodide symporter (NIS or SLC5A5) transports iodide into thethyroid follicular cells that synthesize thyroid hormone. The SLC5A proteinfamily includes transporters of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Disruption of SLC5A5 function by perchlorate, a pervasive environmental contaminant, leads tohuman pathologies, especially hypothyroidism. Perchlorate also disrupts thesexual development of model animals, including threespine stickleback(Gasterosteus aculeatus) and zebrafish (Danio rerio), but the mechanism of actionis unknown. To test the hypothesis that SLC5A5 paralogs are expressed in tissues necessary for the development of reproductive organs, and therefore are plausiblecandidates to mediate the effects of perchlorate on sexual development, we first investigated the evolutionary history of Slc5a paralogs to better understandpotential functional trajectories of the gene family. We identified two clades ofslc5a paralogs with respect to an outgroup of sodium/choline cotransporters(slc5a7); these clades are the NIS clade of sodium/iodide and lactatecotransporters (slc5a5, slc5a6, slc5a8, slc5a8, and slc5a12) and the SGLT cladeof sodium/glucose cotransporters (slc5a1, slc5a2, slc5a3, slc5a4, slc5a10, andslc5a11). We also characterized expression patterns of slc5a genes duringdevelopment. Stickleback embryos and early larvae expressed NIS clade genes inconnective tissue, cartilage, teeth, and thyroid. Stickleback males and femalesexpressed slc5a5 and its paralogs in gonads. Single-cell transcriptomics(scRNA-seq) on zebrafish sex-genotyped gonads revealed that NIS clade-expressing cells included germ cells (slc5a5, slc5a6a, and slc5a6b) and gonadal soma cells(slc5a8l). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that perchlorateexerts its effects on sexual development by interacting with slc5a5 or itsparalogs in reproductive tissues. These findings show novel expression domains ofslc5 genes in stickleback and zebrafish, which suggest similar functions acrossvertebrates including humans, and provide candidates to mediate the effects ofperchlorate on sexual development.

TI  - Functional, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Aspects of Bile.
PG  - 105-120
LID - 10.2147/CEG.S360563 [doi]
AB  - Bile is a unique body fluid synthesized in our liver. Enterohepatic circulationpreserves bile in our body through its efficient synthesis, transport,absorption, and reuptake. Bile is the main excretory route for bile salts,bilirubin, and potentially harmful exogenous lipophilic substances. The primaryway of eliminating cholesterol is bile. Although bile has many organic andinorganic contents, bile acid is the most physiologically active component. Bile acids have a multitude of critical physiologic functions in our body. Theseinclude emulsification of dietary fat, absorption of fat and fat-solublevitamins, maintaining glucose, lipid, and energy homeostasis, sustenance ofintestinal epithelial integrity and epithelial cell proliferation, reducinginflammation in the intestine, and prevention of enteric infection due to itsantimicrobial properties. But bile acids can be harmful in certain alteredconditions like cholecystectomy, terminal ileal disease or resection,cholestasis, duodenogastric bile reflux, duodenogastroesophageal bile reflux, andbile acid diarrhea. Bile acids can have malignant potentials as well. There arealso important diagnostic and therapeutic roles of bile acid and bile acidmodulation.

TI  - Structural and Functional Analysis of the Pyridoxal Phosphate Homeostasis ProteinYggS from Fusobacterium nucleatum.
LID - 4781 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27154781 [doi]
AB  - Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the active form of vitamin B6, but it is highlyreactive and poisonous in its free form. YggS is a PLP-binding protein found inbacteria and humans that mediates PLP homeostasis by delivering PLP to targetenzymes or by performing a protective function. Several biochemical andstructural studies of YggS have been reported, but the mechanism by which YggSrecognizes PLP has not been fully elucidated. Here, we report a functional andstructural analysis of YggS from Fusobacterium nucleatum (FnYggS). The PLPmolecule could bind to native FnYggS, but no PLP binding was observed forselenomethionine (SeMet)-derivatized FnYggS. The crystal structure of FnYggSshowed a type III TIM barrel fold, exhibiting structural homology with severalother PLP-dependent enzymes. Although FnYggS exhibited low (&lt;35%) amino acidsequence similarity with previously studied YggS proteins, its overall structure and PLP-binding site were highly conserved. In the PLP-binding site of FnYggS,the sulfate ion was coordinated by the conserved residues Ser201, Gly218, andThr219, which were positioned to provide the binding moiety for the phosphategroup of PLP. The mutagenesis study showed that the conserved Ser201 residue inFnYggS was the key residue for PLP binding. These results will expand theknowledge of the molecular properties and function of the YggS family.

AB  - Rising global populations and enhanced standards of living in so-calleddeveloping countries have led to an increased demand of food, in particular meat,worldwide. While increasing the production of broiler meat could be a potentialsolution to this problem, broiler meat is plagued by health concerns, such as thedevelopment of antimicrobial resistance and lower meat quality. For this reason, the supplementation of poultry feed with vitamins and antioxidant compounds, suchas polyphenols, has become an attractive prospect for research in this sector.Such supplements could be obtained by extraction of agricultural byproducts (inparticular, grape pomaces and artichoke leaves and bracts), thus contributing to reductions in the total amount of waste biomass produced by the agriculturalindustry. In this review, the effects of poultry feed supplementation withbioactive extracts from grape pomace (skins and/or seeds), as well as extractsfrom artichoke leaves and bracts, were explored. Moreover, the various methodsthat have been employed to obtain extracts from these and other agriculturalbyproducts were listed and described, with a particular focus on novel,eco-friendly extraction methods (using, for example, innovative and biocompatiblesolvents like Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs)) that could reduce the costs andenergy consumption of these procedures, with similar or higher yields compared tostandard methods.

AB  - Carotenoids are naturally abundant, fat-soluble pigmented compounds with dietary,antioxidant and vision protection advantages. The dietary carotenoids, BetaCarotene, Lutein, and Zeaxanthin, complexed with in bovine serum albumin (BSA) inaqueous solution, were explored using Raman spectroscopy to differentiate andquantify their spectral signatures. UV visible absorption spectroscopy wasemployed to confirm the linearity of responses over the concentration rangeemployed (0.05-1 mg/mL) and, of the 4 Raman source wavelengths (785 nm, 660 nm,532 nm, 473 nm), 532 nm was chosen to provide the optimal response. Afterpreprocessing to remove water and BSA contributions, and correct forself-absorption, a partial least squares model with R(2) of 0.9995, resulted inan accuracy of the Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction for Beta Carotene of0.0032 mg/mL and Limit of Detection 0.0106 mg/mL. Principal Components Analysisclearly differentiated solutions of the three carotenoids, based primarily onsmall shifts of the main peak at ~1520 cm(-1). Least squares fitting analysis of the spectra of admixtures of the carotenoid:protein complexes showed reasonablecorrelation between norminal% and fitted%, yielding 100% contribution when fittedwith individual carotenoid complexes and variable contributions with multipleratios of admixtures. The results indicate the technique can potentially be used to quantify the carotenoid content of human serum and to identify theirdifferential contributions for application in clinical analysis.

TI  - Effect of Ester Moiety on Structural Properties of Binary Mixed Monolayers ofAlpha-Tocopherol Derivatives with DPPC.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27154670 [doi]
AB  - Phospholipid membranes are ubiquitous components of cells involved inphysiological processes; thus, knowledge regarding their interactions with other molecules, including tocopherol ester derivatives, is of great importance. Thesurface pressure-area isotherms of pure alpha-tocopherol (Toc) and itsderivatives (oxalate (OT), malonate (MT), succinate (ST), and carbo analog (CT)) were studied in Langmuir monolayers in order to evaluate phase formation,compressibility, packing, and ordering. The isotherms and compressibility resultsindicate that, under pressure, the ester derivatives and CT are able to formtwo-dimensional liquid-condensed (LC) ordered structures with collapse pressures ranging from 27 mN/m for CT to 44 mN/m for OT. Next, the effect of length ofester moiety on the surface behavior of DPPC/Toc derivatives' binary monolayersat air-water interface was investigated. The average molecular area, elasticmodulus, compressibility, and miscibility were calculated as a function of molar fraction of derivatives. Increasing the presence of Toc derivatives in DPPCmonolayer induces expansion of isotherms, increased monolayer elasticity,interrupted packing, and lowered ordering in monolayer, leading to itsfluidization. Decreasing collapse pressure with increasing molar ratio ofderivatives indicates on the miscibility of Toc esters in DPPC monolayer. Theinteractions between components were analyzed using additivity rule andthermodynamic calculations of excess and total Gibbs energy of mixing. Calculatedexcess area and Gibbs energy indicated repulsion between components, confirmingtheir partial mixing. In summary, the mechanism of the observed phenomena ismainly connected with interactions of ionized carboxyl groups of ester moietieswith DPPC headgroup moieties where formed conformations perturb alignment of acylchains, resulting in increasing mean area per molecule, leading to disorderingand fluidization of mixed monolayer.

TI  - Boron Nitride Nanoparticles Loaded with a Boron-Based Hybrid as a Promising Drug Carrier System for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23158249 [doi]
AB  - The search for an innovative and effective drug delivery system that can carryand release targeted drugs with enhanced activity to treat Alzheimer's diseasehas received much attention in the last decade. In this study, we first designed a boron-based drug delivery system for effective treatment of AD by integratingthe folic acid (FA) functional group into hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)nanoparticles (NPs) through an esterification reaction. The hBN-FA drug carriersystem was assembled with a new drug candidate and a novel boron-based hybridcontaining an antioxidant as BLA, to constitute a self-assembled AD nanotransport system. We performed molecular characterization analyses by usingUV-vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer (FTIR),scanning electron microscope (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS)and Zeta potential investigations. Second, we tested the anti-Alzheimerproperties of the carrier system on a differentiated neuroblastoma (SHSY5-Y) cellline, which was exposed to beta-amyloid (1-42) peptides to stimulate anexperimental in vitro AD model. Next, we performed cytotoxicity analyses ofsynthesized molecules on the human dermal fibroblast cell line (HDFa) and theexperimental AD model. Cytotoxicity analyses showed that even higherconcentrations of the carrier system did not enhance the toxicological outcome inHDFa cells. Drug loading analyses reported that uncoated hBN nano conjugate couldnot load the BLA, whereas the memantine loading capacity of hBN was 84.3%. On theother hand, memantine and the BLA loading capacity of the hBN-FA construct wasfound to be 95% and 97.5%, respectively. Finally, we investigated theneuroprotective properties of the nano carrier systems in the experimental ADmodel. According to the results, 25 microg/mL concentrations of hBN-FA+memantine (94% cell viability) and hBN-FA+BLA (99% cell viability) showed ameliorativeproperties against beta-amyloid (1-42) peptide toxicity (50% cell viability).These results were generated through the use of flow cytometry,acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and antioxidant assays. In conclusion, the developed drug carrier system for AD treatment showed promising potential for furtherinvestigations and enlightened neuroprotective capabilities of boron molecules totreat AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, enzymeactivity, systematic toxicity analyses, and animal studies should be performed tounderstand neuroprotective properties of the designed carrier systemcomprehensively.

TI  - Tackling Atherosclerosis via Selected Nutrition.
LID - 8233 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158233 [doi]
AB  - The development and pathogenesis of atherosclerosis are significantly influenced by lifestyle, particularly nutrition. The modern level of science and technology development promote personalized nutrition as an efficient preventive measureagainst atherosclerosis. In this survey, the factors were revealed thatcontribute to the formation of an individual approach to nutrition: geneticcharacteristics, the state of the microbiota of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and environmental factors (diets, bioactive components, cardioprotectors, etc.). In the course of the work, it was found that in order to analyze thepredisposition to atherosclerosis associated with nutrition, genetic featuresaffecting the metabolism of nutrients are significant. The genetic featuresinclude the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of genes andepigenetic factors. The influence of telomere length on the pathogenesis ofatherosclerosis and circadian rhythms was also considered. Relatively new is the study of the relationship between chrono-nutrition and the development ofmetabolic diseases. That is, to obtain the relationship between nutrition andatherosclerosis, a large number of genetic markers should be considered. In this relation, the question arises: "How many genetic features need to be analyzed in order to form a personalized diet for the consumer?" Basically, companies engagedin nutrigenetic research and choosing a diet for the prevention of a number ofmetabolic diseases use SNP analysis of genes that accounts for lipid metabolism, vitamins, the body's antioxidant defense system, taste characteristics, etc.There is no set number of genetic markers. The main diets effective against thedevelopment of atherosclerosis were considered, and the most popular were theketogenic, Mediterranean, and DASH-diets. The advantage of these diets is thecontent of foods with a low amount of carbohydrates, a high amount of vegetables,fruits and berries, as well as foods rich in antioxidants. However, due to therestrictions associated with climatic, geographical, material features, thesediets are not available for a number of consumers. The way out is the use offunctional products, dietary supplements. In this approach, the promisingbiologically active substances (BAS) that exhibit anti-atherosclerotic potential are: baicalin, resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin and other plant metabolites.Among the substances, those of animal origin are popular: squalene, coenzyme Q10,omega-3. For the prevention of atherosclerosis through personalized nutrition, itis necessary to analyze the genetic characteristics (SNP) associated with themetabolism of nutrients, to assess the state of the microbiota of the GIT. Based on the data obtained and food preferences, as well as the individual capabilitiesof the consumer, the optimal diet can be selected. It is topical to excludenutrients of which their excess consumption stimulates the occurrence andpathogenesis of atherosclerosis and to enrich the diet with functional foods(FF), BAS containing the necessary anti-atherosclerotic, and stimulatingmicrobiota of the GIT nutrients. Personalized nutrition is a topical preventivemeasure and there are a number of problems hindering the active use of thisapproach among consumers. The key factors include weak evidence of the influence of a number of genetic features, the high cost of the approach, and difficulties in the interpretation of the results. Eliminating these deficiencies willcontribute to the maintenance of a healthy state of the population throughnutrition.

TI  - Metformin Enhances the Anti-Cancer Efficacy of Sorafenib via SuppressingMAPK/ERK/Stat3 Axis in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
LID - 8083 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23158083 [doi]
AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) incidence, as well as related mortality, has been steadily increasing in the USA and across the globe, partly due to the lack ofeffective therapeutic options for advanced HCC. Though sorafenib is consideredstandard-of-care for advanced HCC, it only improves median survival by a fewmonths when compared to placebo. Sorafenib is also associated with severalunpleasant side effects that often lead to early abatement of therapy. Here, weinvestigate whether a combination regimen including low-dose sorafenib and anon-toxic dose of anti-diabetic drug metformin can achieve effective inhibitionof HCC. Indeed, combining metformin with low-dose sorafenib inhibited growth,proliferation, migration, and invasion potential of HCC cells. We observed a 5.3-and 1.9-fold increase in sub-G1 population in the combination treatment compared to sorafenib alone. We found that the combination of metformin enhanced theefficacy of sorafenib and inhibited the MAPK/ERK/Stat3 axis. Our in vivo studies corroborated the in vitro findings, and mice harboring HepG2-derived tumorsshowed effective tumor reduction upon treatment with low-dose sorafenib andmetformin combination. This work sheds light on a therapeutic strategy aiming to augment sorafenib efficacy or dose-de-escalation that may prove beneficial incircumventing sorafenib resistance as well as minimizing related side effects.

TI  - Shift Work and Serum Vitamin D Levels: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 8919 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19158919 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency are highly prevalent conditions worldwide due to several factors, including poor sun exposure. Shift workers may be exposedto the risk of hypovitaminosis D due to fewer opportunities for sunlight exposurecompared to day workers. A systematic review of the PubMed, SCOPUS, and EMBASEdatabases was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for SystemicReviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement to investigate the effect of shiftwork on vitamin D levels. Mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)of serum 25-OH-D levels in shift workers and non-shift workers were calculated. Atotal of 13 cross-sectional studies were included in the meta-analysis. We found significantly lower levels of serum 25-OH-D in shift workers compared withnon-shift workers (MD: -1.85, 95% CI [-2.49 to -1.21]). Heterogeneity amongincluded studies was high (I(2) = 89%, p &lt; 0.0001), and neither subgroupanalysis nor meta-regression were able to identify specific sources of theheterogeneity that may be related to the different characteristics of shift work among studies. The monitoring of serum vitamin D levels and prompt correction of any deficiencies should be considered in shift workers. Notably, since a largepart of the observations are derived from Koreans, larger epidemiological studiesare needed in other populations.

AB  - The main targets of this were to screen the factors that may influence thedistribution of 25-hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D] reference value in healthy elderlypeople in China, and further explored the geographical distribution differencesof 25(OH)D reference value in China. In this study, we collected the 25(OH)D of25,470 healthy elderly from 58 cities in China to analyze the correlation between25(OH)D and 22 geography secondary indexes through spearman regression analysis. Six indexes with significant correlation were extracted, and a ridge regressionmodel was built, and the country's urban healthy elderly'25(OH)D reference value was predicted. By using the disjunctive Kriging method, we obtained thegeographical distribution of 25(OH)D reference values for healthy elderly people in China. The reference value of 25(OH)D for healthy elderly in China wassignificantly correlated with the 6 secondary indexes, namely, latitude ( degrees), annual temperature range ( degrees C), annual sunshine hours (h), annual mean temperature ( degrees C), annual mean relative humidity (%), and annualprecipitation (mm). The geographical distribution of 25(OH)D values of healthyelderly in China showed a trend of being higher in South China and lower in NorthChina, and higher in coastal areas and lower in inland areas. This study lays afoundation for further research on the mechanism of different influencing factorson the reference value of 25(OH)D index. A ridge regression model composed ofsignificant influencing factors has been established to provide the basis forformulating reference criteria for the treatment factors of the vitamin Ddeficiency and prognostic factors of the COVID-19 using 25(OH)D reference valuein different regions.

AB  - This study aimed to help determine the effect of dietary supplements on symptomcourse and quality of life in patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection. DESIGN: We modified the Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey (WURSS) toconduct a 3 arm, parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial,enrolling patients with mild-to-moderate symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Patientstook placebo (n = 34), vitamin C 1000 mg (n = 32), or melatonin 10 mg (n = 32)orally for 14 days. OUTCOMES: Ninety Eight (98 out of 104 recruited; mean age =52 years) patients completed the study. Outcomes were calculated as differencesfrom baseline scores on each of 2 WURSS-derived surveys and analyzed using aspline regression analysis. Regarding symptom progression, those patients taking placebo and vitamin C progressed at the same rate. When compared with thosetaking placebo (coefficient = -1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.39 to-0.8) the group taking melatonin had a faster resolution of symptoms (coefficient= -0.63 [95% CI -1.02 to -0.21] P = .003). By day 14 all 3 groups had reachedplateau.Quality-of-life impact analysis demonstrated that the group takingvitamin C improved at the same rate as the group taking placebo (coefficient =-0.71 (95% CI = -1.11 to -0.3)). The group taking melatonin (coefficient = -1.16 (95% CI = -1.75 to - 0.57) P < .005) had a faster improvement in quality-of-life.By day 14 all 3 groups had reached plateau. CONCLUSION: Vitamin C 1000 mg oncedaily has no effect on disease progression. Melatonin 10 mg daily may have astatistically significant effect but it is unclear if this represents aclinically significant benefit to those with mild-to-moderate symptoms ofCOVID-19 infection. Further study is warranted.

AB  - Here we report the first case of an association between cystic fibrosis andWernicke's encephalopathy. The patient had a history of cystic fibrosis diagnosedin her early 60s associated with pancreatitis and chronic lung disease. Shepresented with a traumatic hip fracture requiring operative repair. Onexamination, she was found to have bilateral nystagmus. MRI revealed enhancement of the mammillary bodies. Laboratory results were notable for thiaminedeficiency, which in context of the radiographic and physical examinationfindings, confirmed a diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy. The cause of herlow thiamine was thought to be poor dietary intake, weight loss and malabsorptionassociated with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in the setting of a history of recurrent pancreatitis. The patient had complete resolution of her symptoms with the initiation of thiamine supplementation and pancreatic enzymes. Althoughclassically associated with fat soluble vitamin deficiencies, there areincreasing reports of water-soluble vitamin deficiencies associated with cysticfibrosis.

TI  - Phase II Study of a Multi-center Randomized Controlled Trial to Evaluate OralVitamin B12 Treatment for Vitamin B12 Deficiency After Total Gastrectomy inGastric Cancer Patients.
PG  - 3963-3970
LID - 10.21873/anticanres.15891 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: This prospective multi-central randomized phase II trialevaluated the efficacy and safety of oral Vitamin B12 500 mug/day replacementcompared with oral Vitamin B12 1,500 mug/day in patients with Vitamin B12deficiency after total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral Vitamin B12 500 mug/day orVitamin B12 1,500 mug/day in a 1:1 ratio with a minimization method. The primary endpoint was the incidence of a normal serum Vitamin B12 level at three monthsafter treatment. RESULTS: From January 2018 to December 2021, 3 institutionscollaborated with the present study, and 74 patients were registered from these 3institutions. The study was prematurely closed due to poor accrual after reachingalmost 50% of its goal. Among the 74 recruited patients, 36 were allocated to theVitamin B12 500 mug/day arm and 38 to Vitamin B12 1,500 mug/day arm. Theincidences of patients with a normal Vitamin B12 level at 3 months (serum VitaminB12 level >200 pg/ml) were 91.7% (33/36) in the Vitamin B12 500 mug/day arm and100% (38/38) in the Vitamin B12 1,500 mug/day arm (p=0.3587). The types ofclinical symptoms with Vitamin B12 deficiency that improved with Vitamin B12treatment and the degree of improvement were also similar. CONCLUSION: Althoughthe primary endpoint of the present study was not met, it was found that oralVitamin B12 500 mug/day replacement is as effective and safe as oral Vitamin B12 1,500 mug/day replacement for Vitamin B12 deficiency.

TI  - Comparison Between FOLFIRINOX and nal-IRI/FL as Second-line Treatment AfterGemcitabine Plus Nab-paclitaxel for Pancreatic Cancer.
PG  - 3889-3894
LID - 10.21873/anticanres.15882 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: The regimen of nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5-fluorouracil andleucovorin (Nal-IRI/FL) was approved in Japan as second-line chemotherapy aftergemcitabine-based treatment for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) in 2020. We examined the difference in outcome between patients treated with second-linefolinic acid, fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX)and those treated with nal-IRI/FL after first-line gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel(GnP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The outcomes of 34 patients with PDAC who receivedsecond-line FOLFIRINOX (n=21) or nal-IRI/FL (n=13) after GnP at our Departmentfrom January 2016 to June 2021 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Patientbackgrounds did not differ between the groups. Dose reduction was more frequentlyrequired for treatment with FOLFIRINOX than with nal-IRI/FL (86% vs. 46%,p=0.022). Pegfilgrastim and aprepitant were used more frequently in theFOLFIRINOX group (both p<0.01). Progression-free survival (5.9 vs. 8.3 months)and overall survival (9.1 vs. 11.2 months) did not differ significantly betweenthe groups. The frequency of grade 3 (Common Terminology Criteria for AdverseEvents) or higher adverse events was similar between the groups. All-gradeperipheral neuropathy was more common in the FOLFIRINOX group (100% vs. 77%,p=0.048). CONCLUSION: FOLFIRINOX and nal-IRI/FL as second-line therapy after GnP provided similar prognoses, although supportive treatment and dose reduction weremore frequently required for FOLFIRINOX.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate intake of micronutrients in lactating women was prevalent worldwide. In particular, to our knowledge, there has been little reportconcerning Ethiopian lactating women regarding their micronutrient intake. Ourobjective was to assess micronutrient intake inadequacy and its associatedfactors among lactating women in Bahir Dar city, Northwest Ethiopia, 2021.METHODS: Community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February 15 to March 05, 2021. Four hundred thirteen respondents were selected throughsystematic random sampling. Data were collected by interviewer-administeredsemi-structured questionnaire and a single multiphasic 24 hours dietary recallwas used to assess dietary assessment. Data entry and analysis were carried outusing EpiData and SPSS respectively. The ESHA food processor, Ethiopian foodcomposition table, and world food composition table have used the calculation of nutrient values of the selected micronutrient. The nutrient intakes were assessedby Nutrient Adequacy Ratio (NAR) and Mean Adequacy Ratio (MAR). Multivariablebinary logistic regression analysis was done to identify the factors of overallmicronutrient intake inadequacy. RESULT: The overall prevalence of micronutrient intake inadequacy across 12 nutrients was 39.9% [95% CI (34.9, 45.0)]. Theinadequate intake of vitamin A was 98.2%. Similarly, the inadequate intake of Bvitamins ranges from 13.4% to 68.5%. The insufficient intakes of calcium, iron,and zinc were 70.9%, 0%, and 4.7%, respectively. Around 36 and 91.6% of therespondents had inadequate intake of selenium and sodium, respectively. Onmultivariable logistic regression analysis; Being divorced was 2.7 times morelikely to have overall micronutrient intake inadequacy than being married [AOR = 2.71, 95% CI (1.01, 7.33)]. The odds of overall micronutrient intake inadequacywere 2.6 higher in merchants than in housewives [AOR = 2.63, 95% CI (1.40,4.93)]. Lactating women who had poor nutritional knowledge were 2.7 times morelikely to have overall micronutrient intake inadequacy than those who had goodnutritional knowledge [AOR = 2.71, 95% CI (1.47, 4.99)]. CONCLUSION ANDRECOMMENDATION: Overall, the micronutrient intake in lactating women was lowerthan the recommended levels. Therefore; educating lactating women aboutappropriate dietary intake is essential.

TI  - Suppressed serological vitamin A in patients with liver cirrhosis is associatedwith impaired liver function and clinical detoriation.
LID - 10.1097/MEG.0000000000002418 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The liver is of critical importance for the homeostasis of metabolic and immunomodulatory properties as well as the storage of vitamins, especiallyvitamin A. In this prospective analysis, the incidence of serological vitamin Adeficiency and the association with disease severity as well as clinicalcomplications in patients with liver cirrhosis were investigated. METHOD: FromMay 2017 to May 2018, 159 patients with primarily alcohol-associated andnon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-associated preexisting liver cirrhosis were prospectively enrolled and vitamin A status was collected. Clinical complicationsand infections were followed and recorded over a period of 1-year follow-up.Selected findings were validated in an independent cohort of 44 patients.RESULTS: At study inclusion, 77% of patients showed decreased serological vitaminA. Suppressed vitamin A was more common in alcoholic (52 vs. 8%) andNASH-associated liver cirrhosis (16 vs. 9%) than in viral-associated livercirrhosis. MELD score as well as Child-Pugh score were significantly associatedwith suppressed vitamin A (P < 0.001). The association between the degree ofvitamin A suppression and liver function was confirmed in univariate andmultivariate regression analysis. After 1 year of follow-up, 57 patients died and21 patients received a liver transplant. In addition, low vitamin A levels weremore commonly observed in patients with severe ascites (P = 0.001), hepaticencephalopathy (P = 0.002) and hepatorenal syndromes (P = 0.008). In addition,patients with reduced vitamin A showed an increased incidence of infections (P = 0.02), especially respiratory infections (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Suppressedserological Vitamin A is common in patients with liver cirrhosis and isassociated with liver function. Clinical complications and infections are morefrequent in patients with liver cirrhosis and vitamin A suppression.

AB  - Arsenic (As) is a heavy metal and aquatic pollutant and adversely impacts thereproduction of male fish. As a chain-breaking antioxidant, ascorbic acid (AA)has high water solubility and low toxicity. In this context, the current studywas performed to assess the protective role of AA (1 mM) on the sperm cells ofthe rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed to sublethal concentrations of As(8, 16 and 32 mg/L). Sperm quality parameters were analyzed using a sperm classanalyzer system. Lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme levels were used asindicators of oxidative stress. The fertilization, eyeing and hatching rates weredetermined as gamete markers. Reduced sperm quality parameters and fertilitycapacity resulted from in vitro exposure to As (P < 0.05). The oxidative stressin sperm cells increased after As exposure (P < 0.05). The presence of AAimproved sperm movement parameters and fertility potential (P < 0.05). Overall,AA had a positive effect on oxidative stress and fertility ability against Astoxicity and AA supplementation ameliorated detrimental effects of As in spermcells.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe ascorbic acid (AA) concentrations, plasma antioxidantcapacity (PAC) and markers of oxidative stress, as measured by derivatives ofreactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs), in healthy foals at birth and during thefirst month of life. SAMPLES: Venous blood samples were collected from healthyStandardbred (n = 13) and Quarter Horse (n = 10) foals. Plasma AA, PAC, and dROMswere assessed at 3 to 12 hours, 3 days, and 1, 2, and 4 weeks of age. PROCEDURES:AA was measured via high-performance liquid chromatography. PAC and dROMs weremeasured with a free radical analytical system. Comparisons of AA, PAC, and dROMsat different time points were assessed. RESULTS: Mean +/- standard deviation AAconcentrations at 3 to 12 hours (44.7 +/- 19.6 mumol/L; P </= .01), 1 (48.6 +/-22.5 mumol/L; P </= .001), and 2 weeks (41.8 +/- 15.8 mumol/L; P </= .001) werehigher than at 4 weeks of age (28.5 +/- 12.7 mumol/L). Both PAC and dROMssignificantly increased at different time points compared to 3 to 12 hours ofage. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Healthy foals have higher plasma AA concentrationsshortly after birth, which then gradually decrease throughout the first month of life, suggesting that AA may represent a key antioxidant in the postnatal period.The concurrent increase in PAC and dROMs suggests that dynamic development ofoxidative balance occurs after birth in foals. Development of AA, PAC, and dROMreference ranges in healthy foals could be used to guide therapeuticinterventions and monitor during disease states characterized by increasedoxidative stress.

TI  - Reconsidering vitamin D optimal values based on parathyroid hormone levels in aNorth Algerian cohort: stratification by gender and season.
PG  - 100
LID - 10.1007/s11657-022-01137-2 [doi]
AB  - "Health-based threshold value" is used to define the optimal cutoff of vitamin D.This approach is based on the hypothesis of a secondary hyperparathyroidismassociated with hypovitaminosis D. We define the optimal values in a NorthAlgerian population. The optimal value is 25.0 ng/ml in men and 30.0 ng/ml inwomen. PURPOSE/INTRODUCTION: There is no consensus defining the vitamin D optimalvalues. The aim of this study is to establish vitamin D optimal values in theNorthern Algerian population, based on its skeletal effects as represented by theinverse relationship between 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH) D) and parathyroidhormone (PTH). METHODS: 451 healthy volunteers of both genders, aged 19 to 79years, were enrolled in a cross-sectional study conducted at the medical analysislaboratory of the University Hospital of Blida, Algeria. 25(OH) D was assessed bya sequential competitive immuno-fluoroassay technique. Determination of vitamin Doptimal values was performed based on the kinetic relationship between 25(OH) Dand PTH, as explored by inverse nonlinear regression on a spline plots curve. Theoptimal value represents the 25(OH) D level at which PTH ceases to increase andreaches a virtual plateau. RESULTS: In men and women, respectively, the 25 (OH) Dthresholds are estimated at 25.0 ng/ml and 30 ng/ml, above this value, PTHstabilizes in a virtual plateau, estimated at 22.3 pg/ml and 26.8 pg/ml. In warm and cold seasons, respectively, the 25 (OH) D cut-offs are estimated at 30.0ng/ml and 25.0 ng/ml, from these values, the PTH stabilizes in a virtual plateau,estimated at 21.5 pg/ml and 27.7 pg/ml. CONCLUSION: In this study, the optimalvalues of 25(OH) D were defined for the first time in a North Algerian adultpopulation. The optimal value is 25.0 ng/ml in men and 30.0 ng/ml in women.

TI  - Profiling vitamin D, its mediators and proinflammatory cytokines in rheumatoidarthritis: A case-control study.
PG  - e676
LID - 10.1002/iid3.676 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The active form of vitamin D has immunomodulatory andanti-inflammatory effect. Vitamin D is implicated in pathogenesis of rheumatoidarthritis (RA) and its deficiency leads to increased inflammation. Moreover, its production is dependent on concentration of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH). Cytokines mediates inflammation in RA synovium. This studyevaluated vitamin D, its mediators and proinflammatory cytokines among RApatients. METHODS: In a case-control study, 78 RA patients from Komfo AnokyeTeaching Hospital rheumatology clinic and 60 healthy blood donors were recruited.Chemistry analyzer and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits were used tomeasure biochemical parameters and cytokines. RESULTS: We found significantlyhigher levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in RA patients compared with controls (p <.05). There was a significant positive correlation between intact parathyroidhormone (iPTH) and IL-10 (r = .30, p < .05) and a negative correlation betweenIL-6 (r = -0.28, p > .05), IL-1beta (r = -0.25, p > .05), TNF-alpha (r = -0.26, p> .05), IFN-gamma (r = -0.24, p > .05), and iPTH. There was a significantnegative correlation between IL-1beta (r = -0.33, p < .05), IFN- gamma (r =-0.29, p < .05), and calcium. CONCLUSION: Reduced PTH, calcium, and phosphorus isassociated with higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines which may worsen RAdisease condition. Vitamin D is therefore not an independent regulator ofproinflammatory cytokines in RA.

TI  - Dietary vitamins, carotenoids, and their sources in relation to age-relatedmacular degeneration risk in China: A population-based case-control study.
PG  - 1-22
LID - 10.1017/S0007114522002161 [doi]
AB  - Mechanistic studies have suggested that antioxidants have beneficial effects onage-related macular degeneration (AMD). This study aimed to investigate theassociation between the types and sources of dietary vitamin and carotenoidintakes and AMD risk in China. A matched case-control study of 260 patients whowere clinically diagnosed with AMD and 260 matched controls was performed. Theparticipants were interviewed for dietary information and potential confounders, and comprehensive ophthalmic examinations were performed. Conditional logisticmodels were used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI)across the categories of specific vitamins and carotenoids and their mainsources. When comparing the extreme quartiles, the ORs(95% CI) were 0.30 (0.10,0.88) for lutein and 0.28 (0.11, 0.74) for beta-cryptoxanthin. The associationsbetween AMD and other dietary vitamin and carotenoid intakes were generallyweaker and non-significant. Higher intakes of spinach and egg, which areimportant sources of lutein, were associated with a reduced odds of AMD, with an OR comparing the highest and lowest categories of spinach being 0.42 (95%CI:0.20, 0.88) and that comparing the highest and lowest categories of the egg being0.52 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.98). Participants who were in the highest category of both egg intake and spinach intake had a much greater reduced odds of having AMD (OR: 0.23; 95%CI: 0.08, 0.71) than those in the lowest category of egg intake andspinach intake. In conclusion, a higher intake of lutein and lutein-rich foodswas associated with a significantly decreased odds of AMD. These findings providefurther evidence of the benefits of lutein and lutein-rich foods in theprevention of AMD.

TI  - Underutilized legumes, Cajanus cajan and Glycine max may bring about antisicklingeffect in sickle cell disease by modulation of redox homeostasis in sicklederythrocytes and alteration of its functional chemistry.
PG  - e14322
LID - 10.1111/jfbc.14322 [doi]
AB  - The antisickling and anti-oxidative effect of the Cajanus cajan, Glycine max, andtheir blends were investigated in sickled erythrocytes. The powdered samples wereanalyzed for their nutritional and anti-nutritional constituents. Their aqueousextracts were analyzed for in vitro antioxidant activities. The extracts wereincubated with sickled erythrocytes at 37 degrees C for 6 hours and theantisickling effect examined via microscopic analysis. The blend was the mostactive and its incubated cells were subjected to anti-oxidative analysis whichcovers for GSH, SOD, catalase, and lipid peroxidation (LPO). Chemical functional group of the treated cells was analyzed with FTIR spectroscopy. The in silicobinding of the predominant amino acid to hemoglobin was also investigated. Anincreased concentration of leucine was observed in the blend compared to that of C. cajan and G. max, respectively. Vitamins C, B6, and B9 were the only vitamins observed in the blend. Phytate and oxalate were present in all samples. Allextracts displayed significant (p < .05) scavenging activities. Treatment withthe blend exacerbated SOD and catalase activities as well as the GSH level, whilesuppressing LPO. FTIR analysis of the treated cells showed the presence ofhydrophobic functional groups. Leucine was the predominant amino acid, and itshowed a potent molecular interaction with HIS-87 residue of the alpha chain of1HCO. C. cajan and G. max blend inhibited sickling activities of sickleerythrocytes, while concomitantly exacerbating their endogenous antioxidantenzymes activity and modification of the functional chemistry. PRACTICALAPPLICATIONS: Cajanus cajan and Glycine max are among the common underutilizedlegumes in Nigeria. Aside their nutritional properties, these legumes have beenused from time immemorial for the treatment and management of various ailments.Sickle cell anemia is a class of hemoglobinopathy common in Sub-Saharan Africa.There have been concerns about its treatment owing to the increasing scourge ofthe disease coupled to the financial burden of its management. This study reportsthe ability of the potentials of the legumes to prevent sickling activities ofsickled erythrocytes and the possible biochemical mechanism involved.

AB  - The extraskeletal effect of vitamin D on adipose tissue biology and modulation inhuman obesity is of great interest and has been extensively investigated. Currentevidence from preclinical and clinical studies in human adipose tissue suggeststhat the anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D are evident and consistent,whereas the effects of vitamin D on adipocyte differentiation, adipogenesis, and energy metabolism and the effects of vitamin D supplementation on adipokinelevels are inconclusive. Interventional studies related to medical and surgicalweight loss in humans have shown small or no improvement in vitamin D status.Additionally, the benefit of vitamin D supplementation for the reduction invisceral adipose tissue has only been demonstrated in a few studies. Overall, thefindings on the relationship between vitamin D and visceral adipose tissue inhumans are still inconclusive. Further studies are required to confirm thebeneficial effects of vitamin D on ameliorating adipose tissue dysfunction.

TI  - Low Vitamin D Status Relates to the Poor Response of Peripheral Pulse WaveVelocity Following Acute Maximal Exercise in Healthy Young Men.
LID - 3074 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153074 [doi]
AB  - The primary objective of this study was to determine the effects of vitamin Dlevels on peripheral pulse wave velocity (pPWV) following acute maximal exercise in healthy young adults. Fifty male healthy adults from National Chung ChengUniversity participated in the study. Participants were divided into the25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) sufficiency group (n = 28, 25(OH)D >/= 50 nmol/L)and deficiency group (n = 22, 25(OH)D &lt; 50 nmol/L). The acute maximal exercisewas performed using an incremental cycling test to exhaustion. Additionally, the pPWV and blood pressure were obtained at rest and 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 min afteracute maximal exercise. The results show that 25(OH)D deficiency group had higherpPWV at post-exercise (5.34 +/- 0.71 vs. 4.79 +/- 0.81 m/s, p &lt; 0.05),post-exercise 15 min (5.13 +/- 0.53 vs. 4.48 +/- 0.66 m/s, p &lt; 0.05) andpost-exercise 30 min (5.26 +/- 0.84 vs. 4.78 +/- 0.50 m/s, p &lt; 0.05) than the sufficiency group. Furthermore, there was a significant inverse correlationbetween 25(OH)D levels and pPWV following acute maximal exercise. Our studydemonstrated that low vitamin D status relates to the poor response of pPWVfollowing maximal exercise in healthy young men. Vitamin D deficiency mayincrease the risk of incident cardiovascular events after acute exhaustiveexercise, even in healthy and active adults.

AB  - It is unclear whether vitamin D benefits inpatients with COVID-19. Objective: To examine the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 outcomes. Design: Cohort study. Setting: National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C) database. Patients:158,835 patients with confirmed COVID-19 and a sub-cohort with severe disease (n = 81,381) hospitalized between 1 January 2020 and 31 July 2021. Methods: Weidentified vitamin D prescribing using codes for vitamin D and its derivatives.We created a sub-cohort defined as having severe disease as those who requiredmechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), hadhospitalization &gt;5 days, or hospitalization ending in death or hospice. Using logistic regression, we adjusted for age, sex, race, BMI, Charlson ComorbidityIndex, and urban/rural residence, time period, and study site. Outcomes ofinterest were death or transfer to hospice, longer length of stay, and mechanicalventilation/ECMO. Results: Patients treated with vitamin D were older, had morecomorbidities, and higher BMI compared with patients who did not receive vitamin D. Vitamin D treatment was associated with an increased odds of death or referralfor hospice (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.10: 95% CI 1.05-1.14), hospital stay&gt;5 days (AOR 1.78: 95% CI 1.74-1.83), and increased odds of mechanicalventilation/ECMO (AOR 1.49: 95% CI 1.44-1.55). In the sub-cohort of severeCOVID-19, vitamin D decreased the odds of death or hospice (AOR 0.90, 95% CI0.86-0.94), but increased the odds of hospital stay longer &gt;5 days (AOR 2.03, 95% CI 1.87-2.21) and mechanical ventilation/ECMO (AOR 1.16, 95% CI 1.12-1.21).Limitations: Our findings could reflect more aggressive treatment due to higherseverity. Conclusion: Vitamin D treatment was associated with greater odds ofextended hospitalization, mechanical ventilation/ECMO, and death or hospicereferral.

TI  - Vitamin D and the Ability to Produce 1,25(OH)2D Are Critical for Protection from Viral Infection of the Lungs.
LID - 3061 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153061 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D supplementation is linked to improved outcomes from respiratory virusinfection, and the COVID-19 pandemic renewed interest in understanding thepotential role of vitamin D in protecting the lung from viral infections.Therefore, we evaluated the role of vitamin D using animal models of pandemicH1N1 influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2)infection. In mice, dietary-induced vitamin D deficiency resulted in lunginflammation that was present prior to infection. Vitamin D sufficient (D+) anddeficient (D-) wildtype (WT) and D+ and D- Cyp27B1 (Cyp) knockout (KO, cannotproduce 1,25(OH)2D) mice were infected with pandemic H1N1. D- WT, D+ Cyp KO, and D- Cyp KO mice all exhibited significantly reduced survival compared to D+ WTmice. Importantly, survival was not the result of reduced viral replication, asinfluenza M gene expression in the lungs was similar for all animals. Based onthese findings, additional experiments were performed using the mouse and hamstermodels of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In these studies, high dose vitamin Dsupplementation reduced lung inflammation in mice but not hamsters. A trend tofaster weight recovery was observed in 1,25(OH)2D treated mice that survivedSARS-CoV-2 infection. There was no effect of vitamin D on SARS-CoV-2 N geneexpression in the lung of either mice or hamsters. Therefore, vitamin Ddeficiency enhanced disease severity, while vitamin D sufficiency/supplementationreduced inflammation following infections with H1N1 influenza and SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Serum Vitamin D Concentrations, Time to Pregnancy, and Pregnancy Outcomes amongPreconception Couples: A Cohort Study in Shanghai, China.
LID - 3058 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153058 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D in reproductive health is still unclear. Thisstudy aimed to assess the effect of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), amongpreconception couples, on fecundity, and the associations between 25(OH)Dconcentrations before and during pregnancy, and pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: 200 preconception couples attempting to conceive were recruited and were followed-up until childbirth. Time to pregnancy was collected via telephone every two months or obtained via a questionnaire during pregnancy. Blood samples were collected tomeasure serum 25(OH)D levels from both partners at enrollment and from womenduring the second and third trimester of pregnancy. RESULTS: Couples had higherconception rates within six months (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 3.72, 95% CI:1.16, 11.9) and reduced time to pregnancy (adjusted fecundability ratio (aFR):1.50, 95% CI: 1.01, 2.23) if male partners had sufficient 25(OH)D compared withinsufficient 25(OH)D. Compared to pregnant women with insufficient 25(OH)D in thethird trimester of pregnancy, sufficient 25(OH)D was associated with reduced oddsof anemia (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.82), longer gestational age (beta: 0.53, 95%CI: 0.04, 1.01) and newborns' higher ponderal index (beta: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.01,0.19). CONCLUSIONS: Sufficient serum 25(OH)D levels among preconception men orduring pregnancy were associated with better reproductive health.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the analytical and densitometric changes 2years after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Aretrospective study of a prospectively collected database was performed. Morbidlyobese patients undergoing RYGB or SG, as primary bariatric procedures, wereincluded. Weight loss; analytical levels of parathormone (PTH), vitamin D, andcalcium; and densitometric parameters were investigated. In total, 650 patientswere included in the study, and 523 patients (80.5%) underwent RYGB and 127(19.5%) SG. There were no significant differences in excess weight loss at 24months between both groups. When comparing preoperative and postoperative values,a significantly greater increase in PTH values was observed in the RYGB group,whereas there were no significant differences in calcium and vitamin D levels.The mean t-score values decreased after surgery at all the locations and in both groups. The reduction in the t-score was significantly greater in the RYGB group at the femoral trochanter and lumbar spine. A decrease in bone mineral density(BMD) was observed after both techniques. The mean BMD decrease was significantlygreater in the femoral trochanter and lumbar spine after RYGB.

LID - 10.3390/nu14153048 [doi]
AB  - Retrospective studies showed a relationship between vitamin D status and COVID-19severity and mortality, with an inverse relation between SARS-CoV-2 positivityand circulating calcifediol levels. The objective of this pilot study was toinvestigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the length of hospitalstay and clinical improvement in patients with vitamin D deficiency hospitalized with COVID-19. The study was randomized, double blind and placebo controlled. Atotal of 50 subjects were enrolled and received, in addition to the bestavailable COVID therapy, either vitamin D (25,000 IU per day over 4 consecutivedays, followed by 25,000 IU per week up to 6 weeks) or placebo. The length ofhospital stay decreased significantly in the vitamin D group compared to theplacebo group (4 days vs. 8 days; p = 0.003). At Day 7, a significantly lowerpercentage of patients were still hospitalized in the vitamin D group compared tothe placebo group (19% vs. 54%; p = 0.0161), and none of the patients treatedwith vitamin D were hospitalized after 21 days compared to 14% of the patientstreated with placebo. Vitamin D significantly reduced the duration ofsupplemental oxygen among the patients who needed it (4 days vs. 7 days in theplacebo group; p = 0.012) and significantly improved the clinical recovery of thepatients, as assessed by the WHO scale (p = 0.0048). In conclusion, this studydemonstrated that the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients requiringhospitalization was improved by administration of vitamin D.

AB  - Migraine is related to brain energy deficiency. Niacin is a required coenzyme in mitochondrial energy metabolism. However, the relationship between dietary niacinand migraines remains uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the relationship betweendietary niacin and migraine. This study used cross-sectional data from peopleover 20 years old who took part in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1999 and 2004, collecting details on their severe headaches ormigraines, dietary niacin intake, and several other essential variables. Therewere 10,246 participants, with 20.1% (2064/10,246) who experienced migraines.Compared with individuals with lower niacin consumption (Q1, </=12.3 mg/day), theadjusted OR values for dietary niacin intake and migraine in Q2 (12.4-18.3mg/day), Q3 (18.4-26.2 mg/day), and Q4 (>/=26.3 mg/day) were 0.83 (95% CI:0.72-0.97, p = 0.019), 0.74 (95% CI: 0.63-0.87, p &lt; 0.001), and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58-0.88, p = 0.001), respectively. The association between dietary niacinintake and migraine exhibited an L-shaped curve (nonlinear, p = 0.011). The OR ofdeveloping migraine was 0.975 (95% CI: 0.956-0.994, p = 0.011) in participantswith niacin intake &lt; 21.0 mg/day. The link between dietary niacin intake andmigraine in US adults is L-shaped, with an inflection point of roughly 21.0 mg/d.

TI  - Lower Serum Calcium Levels Associated with Disrupted Sleep and Rest-ActivityRhythm in Shift Workers.
LID - 3021 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153021 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in many developed countries, and severalstudies suggest that vitamin D plays an essential role in brain function. Arecent study showed that vitamin D deficiency was closely associated with daytimesleepiness and shorter sleep time. The relationshipbetween vitamin D levels andcalcium levels is well established, and calcium level regulates slow-wave sleepgeneration. It is conceivable that the sleep disturbance in vitamin D deficiency may be due to an altered calcium level. Nonetheless, calcium levels, sleepdisturbances, and activity rhythms have not been investigated directly.Therefore, we hypothesized that calcium and vitamin D levels might be importantin regulating sleep and activity rhythm, and we analyzed the correlation withcalcium levels by actigraphy analysis. Interestingly, a negative correlation was found between calcium level and sleep latency, total sleep time, use of sleepmedicine, and daytime dysfunction among shift workers. In contrast, non-shiftworkers showed a negative correlation between the calcium level and the circadianphase. These findings suggest that low serum calcium levels may disruptsleep-wake control and rest-activity rhythm, even if they are within the normalrange.

LID - 10.3390/nu14153018 [doi]
AB  - For at least 1.2 billion years, eukaryotes have been able to synthesize sterolsand, therefore, can produce vitamin D when exposed to UV-B. Vitamin Dendocrinology was established some 550 million years ago in animals, when thehigh-affinity nuclear receptor VDR (vitamin D receptor), transport proteins andenzymes for vitamin D metabolism evolved. This enabled vitamin D to regulate, viaits target genes, physiological process, the first of which were detoxificationand energy metabolism. In this way, vitamin D was enabled to modulate theenergy-consuming processes of the innate immune system in its fight againstmicrobes. In the evolving adaptive immune system, vitamin D started to act as anegative regulator of growth, which prevents overboarding reactions of T cells inthe context of autoimmune diseases. When, some 400 million years ago, speciesleft the ocean and were exposed to gravitation, vitamin D endocrinology took overthe additional role as a major regulator of calcium homeostasis, being important for a stable skeleton. Homo sapiens evolved approximately 300,000 years ago inEast Africa and had adapted vitamin D endocrinology to the intensive exposure of the equatorial sun. However, when some 75,000 years ago, when anatomically modernhumans started to populate all continents, they also reached regions withseasonally low or no UV-B, i.e., and under these conditions vitamin D became avitamin.

LID - 3009 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153009 [doi]
AB  - The association between vitamin D deficiency and especially critical shortage of active vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, calcitriol) with the development ofsecondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) is a well-known fact in patients withchronic kidney disease (CKD). The association between sHPT and important clinicaloutcomes, such as kidney disease progression, fractures, cardiovascular events,and mortality, has turned the prevention and the control of HPT into a core issueof patients with CKD and on dialysis. However, vitamin D therapy entails the riskof unwanted side effects, such as hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Thisreview summarizes the developments of vitamin D therapies in CKD patients of the last decades, from calcitriol substitution to extended-release calcifediol. Inview of the study situation for vitamin D insufficiency and sHPT in CKD patients,we conclude that the nephrology community has to solve three core issues: (1)What is the optimal parathyroid hormone (PTH) target level for CKD and dialysispatients? (2) What is the optimal vitamin D level to support optimal PTHtitration? (3) How can sHPT treatment support reduction in the occurrence of hardrenal and cardiovascular events in CKD and dialysis patients?

LID - 10.3390/nu14153010 [doi]
AB  - Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain (CMP) arediffuse suffering syndromes that interfere with normal activities. Controversyexists over the role of vitamin D in the treatment of these diseases. We carried out a systematic literature review of randomized controlled trials (RCT) toestablish whether vitamin D (25OHD) deficiency is more prevalent in CMP patients and to assess the effects of vitamin D supplementation in pain management inthese individuals. We searched PubMed, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro),and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for RCTspublished in English from 1 January 1990 to 10 July 2022. A total of 434 studies were accessed, of which 14 satisfied the eligibility criteria. In our reviewthree studies, of which two had the best-quality evidence, a correlation between diffuse muscle pain and 25OHD deficiency was confirmed. Six studies, of whichfour had the best-quality evidence, demonstrated that appropriate supplementationmay have beneficial effects in patients with established blood 25OHD deficiency. Eight studies, of which six had the best-quality evidence, demonstrated that25OHD supplementation results in pain reduction. Our results suggest a possiblerole of vitamin D supplementation in alleviating the pain associated with FMS andCMP, especially in vitamin D-deficient individuals.

TI  - The Influence of Maternal Vitamin D Supplementation in Pregnancies Associatedwith Preeclampsia: A Case-Control Study.
LID - 3008 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153008 [doi]
AB  - Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific illness that is hypothesized to occur due tovitamin D deficiency during pregnancy. Therefore, vitamin D supplementation inearly pregnancy should be explored for preventing preeclampsia and promotingneonatal well-being. The present study follows a case-control analysis that aims to determine the effect of vitamin D supplements on reducing the probability ofrecurrent preeclampsia. We identified 59 patients for the control group withoutvitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, while 139 patients were included inthe cases group of pregnant women with a history of preeclampsia who confirmedtaking daily vitamin D supplements in either 2000 UI or 4000 UI until the 36thweek of pregnancy. There were 61 (80.3%) patients with a normal serum vitamin Dlevel measured at 32 weeks in the pregnant women who took a daily dose of 4000 UIvitamin D and 43 (68.3%) in those who took a 2000 UI dose of vitamin D, compared to just 32 (54.2%) in those who did not take vitamin D at all. Regarding theblood pressure of pregnant women measured at 32 weeks, it was observed that 20.3%were hypertensive in the no supplementation group, compared to only 11.1% and6.6% in those who were taking vitamin D during pregnancy (p-value = 0.049). Serumvitamin D levels at 32 weeks were measured at an average value of 23.9 ng/mL,compared with 28.4 ng/mL in the group taking a 2000 UI daily dose and 33.6 inthose who supplemented with 4000 UI daily (p-value &lt; 0.001). Proteinuria wasidentified more often in the group at risk for preeclampsia who did not takevitamin D supplements, while systolic blood pressure (p-value = 0.036) as well asdiastolic blood pressure (p-value = 0.012), were all identified to havesignificantly higher values in the pregnant women with a history of preeclampsia that did not take vitamin D during the current pregnancy. The significant riskfactors for preeclampsia development in pregnant patients at risk are:insufficient vitamin D serum levels (&lt;20 ng/mL), OR = 2.52; no vitamin Dsupplementation, OR = 1.46; more than two pregnancies, OR = 1.89; gestationaldiabetes mellitus, OR = 1.66; and cardiovascular comorbidities, OR = 2.18. These findings imply that vitamin D has a role in the preservation of placentalfunction and, therefore, in the prevention of the development of latepreeclampsia. Pregnant mothers who supplemented their diets with vitamin D wereprotected against preeclampsia recurrence. Vitamin D supplementation duringpregnancy may aid in the prevention of gestational hypertension and preeclampsia.

TI  - Differential Effects of Three Nutritional Supplements on the Nutrient Intake ofPregnant Women Enrolled in a Conditional Cash Transfer Program in Mexico: ACluster Randomized Trial.
LID - 3003 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153003 [doi]
AB  - Supplementation in malnourished pregnant women should not displace naturalhealthy foods. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the differential effects of threenutritional supplements on macro- and micronutrient intake of pregnant womenbeneficiaries of the conditional cash transfer program Prospera (CCT-POP).METHODS: Prospective cluster randomized trial. Communities were randomly assignedto receive a fortified beverage (Beverage), micronutrient tablets (Tablets), ormicronutrient powder (MNP). Pregnant women (at &lt;25 weeks) were recruited. The food frequency questionnaire was applied at 25 and 37 weeks of pregnancy and atone and three months postpartum (mpp). Differential effects of the threesupplements on the median change in nutrient intake from baseline to eachfollow-up stage were estimated. RESULTS: Median change in protein intake fromdietary and supplement sources were significantly lower for MNP and Tablets than for Beverages (baseline to 37 w: -7.80 +/- 2.90 and -11.54 +/- 3.00,respectively; baseline to 1 mpp: -7.34 +/- 2.90 for MNP, p &lt; 0.001). Compared to Beverages, median increases were higher for the MNP for vitamins C (31.2 +/-11.7, p &lt; 0.01), E (1.67 +/- 0.81, p &lt; 0.05), and B12 (0.83 +/- 0.27, p&lt; 0.01) from baseline to 37 wk; from baseline to 1 mpp, there was a highermedian increase in B12 (0.55 +/- 0.25, p &lt; 0.05) and folate (63.4 +/- 24.3, p &lt; 0.01); and from baseline to 3 mpp, a higher median increase in iron (2.38+/- 1.06, p &lt; 0.05) and folate (94.4 +/- 38.1, p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS:Intake of micronutrients was higher for MNP and Tablets, likely due to fooddisplacement among Beverage consumers. Although iron bioavailability andabsorption inhibitors were not considered for the present analyses, thedistribution of Tablets or MNP had several advantages in this context wheremicronutrient deficiency remains high among pregnant women, but macronutrientintake is generally adequate or even high.

TI  - Quantification of Phytochemicals, Cellular Antioxidant Activities andAntiproliferative Activities of Raw and Roasted American Pistachios (Pistaciavera L.).
LID - 3002 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14153002 [doi]
AB  - The consumption of pistachios has been linked to many potential health benefits. Phytochemicals in pistachios, including phenolics, vitamin E and carotenoids,have been considered to make contributions to the health benefits. The objectivesof this study were (1) to explore the phytochemical profiles (total phenolics andtotal flavonoids, including both free and bound forms), selected phytochemicals, vitamin E and carotenoids of raw and roasted pistachios; (2) to determine totalantioxidant activity and cellular antioxidant activity (CAA); and (3) to explore antiproliferative activities of pistachio extracts against human breast, liverand colon cancer cells in vitro. Both raw and roasted pistachios contained hightotal phenolics, at 479.9 +/- 10.2 (raw) and 447.9 +/- 9.4 (roasted) mg GAE/100g, respectively, and high flavonoids, at 178.4 +/- 10.6 (raw) and 144.1 +/- 7.4(roasted) mg GAE/100 g, respectively. The contributions of the free form to thetotal phenolics in pistachios were 82% (raw) and 84% (roasted), respectively, andthe contributions of the free form to the total flavonoids in pistachios were 65%(raw) and 70% (roasted), respectively. Gentisic acid and catechin were the major phenolics in raw and roasted pistachios, respectively. Both raw and roastedpistachios had similar total antioxidant activity evaluated byOxygen-Radical-Scavenging Capacity (ORAC) assay, at 7387.9 +/- 467 (raw) and7375.3 +/- 602 (roasted) mumol TE/100 g, respectively. Both raw and roastedpistachio extracts exhibited cellular antioxidant activity inhibitingperoxyradical radical-induced oxidation, with CAA values of 77.39 +/- 4.25 (wash)and 253.71 +/- 19.18 (no wash) mumol QE/100 g of raw pistachios and 115.62 +/-3.02 (wash) and 216.76 +/- 6.6 (no wash) mumol QE/100 g of roasted pistachios.Roasted pistachios contained more vitamin E when compared with raw pistachios,while raw pistachios contained more carotenoids than the roasted pistachios.Additionally, the free form of roasted pistachios extracts exhibited superiorantiproliferation activity against HepG2, Caco-2 and MDA-MB-231 cancer cells in adose-dependent manner, with EC50 34.73 +/- 1.64, 36.66 +/- 3.3 and 7.41 +/- 0.82 mg per mL, respectively. These results provided new knowledge about thephytochemical profiles, antioxidant activity, cellular antioxidant activity andantiproliferative activity of raw and roasted pistachios.

LID - 10.3390/ph15080907 [doi]
AB  - Royal jelly is a yellowish-white substance with a gel texture that is secretedfrom the hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands of young worker bees. It consistsmainly of water (50-56%), proteins (18%), carbohydrates (15%), lipids (3-6%),minerals (1.5%), and vitamins, and has many beneficial properties such asantimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, antioxidant, antidiabetic,immunomodulatory, and anti-aging. Royal jelly has been used since ancient timesin traditional medicine, cosmetics and as a functional food due to its highnutritional value. The main bioactive substances are royalactin, and10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10-HDA). Other important bioactive molecules withantioxidant and photoprotective skin activity are polyphenols. However, theypresent difficulties in extraction and in use as they are unstablephysicochemically, and a higher temperature causes color change and componentdegradation. In the present study, a new encapsulation and delivery systemconsisting of liposomes and cyclodextrins incorporating royal jelly has beendeveloped. The new delivery system aims to the elimination of the stabilitydisadvantages of royal jelly's sensitive component 10-HDA, but also to thecontrolled release of its ingredients and, more particularly, 10-HDA, for anenhanced bioactivity in cosmeceutical applications.

AB  - Coconut is a tropical fruit whose flesh has high flavor quality and nutritionalvalue; however, the differences between coconut varieties are still unclear.Here, volatiles and non-volatiles were profiled at three ripening stages byHS-SPME/GC-MS and UHPLC-MS/MS in two coconut varieties (Hainan Tall, HT and GreenDwarf, GD). Four metabolite classes of volatiles were associated with good aroma including hydrocarbons, benzenoids, alcohols and esters, and these volatiles weregenerally higher in GD, especially at 7 and 9 months of coconut growth.Pathway-based metabolomics revealed that flavonols and their derivatives weresignificantly enriched in HT, and some of these metabolites were key determinantsof HT flesh bitterness, including kaempferol 7-O-glucoside, a known bittermetabolite. Despite the overall accumulation of amino acids, including L-alanine,L-serine and L-methionine in GD, comparative metabolomics revealed that HT flesh provides a higher content of vitamins than GD. This study sheds light on themetabolic pathways and key metabolites differentiating the flesh flavor qualityand nutritional value among coconut varieties, and reveals the possiblemechanisms of flavor formation and regulation in coconut fruits.

TI  - Level of Knowledge and Awareness of Female Undergraduate Students andDeterminants of Knowledge of Folic Acid and Supplementation.
LID - 986 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina58080986 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: Folic acid (FA) is a necessary ingredient for numerousbodily activities including pregnancy. Because of this, women should haveknowledge and awareness of the health benefits of FA supplementation. Thus, weaimed to investigate the level of knowledge on the importance of FA and determineassociated factors for knowledge among female college students at King SaudUniversity in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Material and Methods: We conducted across-sectional study using a questionnaire between January 2020 and February2021 among female college students aged 17 to 26 years old. The questionnaireadapted with permission from Alnaami et al. included questions on the demographicprofile of the participants as well as questions related to their knowledge andawareness of FA, FA supplementation, the importance of supplementation and their sources of knowledge of FA. Results: A total of 437 female undergraduate studentsparticipated in the study, 285 (65.2%) of whom were from the non-health colleges and 152 (34.8%) from the health colleges. The majority of participants werebetween ages 17 and 21 years old (n = 361, 82.6%). Half of the respondents werein their 3rd and 4th year of study (n = 122, 50.8%), 138 respondents (31.6%) weremarried, and 111 of these married women (80.4%) had children. There were 266respondents (61.0%) who had heard and had knowledge of FA, 241 (55.3%) knew of FAtiming of intake, 243 (55.7%) of FA duration of intake and 362 (83.0%) knew ofthe diseases prevented by FA supplementation. Linear regression analysis showedthat being in the health college (B = 1.464, t = 11.37, p &lt; 0.001, 95% CI =1.211, 1.717) and a higher educational year level (B = 0.139, t = 2.442, p =0.015, 95% CI = 0.027, 0.251) were the significant predictors of knowledge of FA.Conclusions: Knowledge of FA and FA supplementation was low at 61% consideringthat our study population were college students. Being enrolled in a healthcollege and in a higher educational year level were significant positivecorrelates of higher knowledge of FA and FA supplementation. Despite this, there exists a gap of information regarding FA and FA supplementation particularlyamong single women and college educated women in the early years of their collegelife as well as those in non-health colleges.

TI  - Role of Multiple Vitamin D-Related Polymorphisms in Multiple Sclerosis Severity: Preliminary Findings.
LID - 1307 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13081307 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial disease whosepathogenesis is the result of interaction among genetic, epigenetic, andenvironmental factors. Among these, a role for vitamin D hypovitaminosis hasemerged in recent decades. Vitamin D levels are influenced by both environmental and genetic factors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes codifyingfor molecules involved in vitamin D metabolism have been associated with anincreased risk of developing MS. However, few studies assessed the association ofsuch SNPs with the severity of the disease. The aim of this observational studywas to evaluate the potential association among vitamin D status, MS severity,and vitamin D-related SNPs, alone or in combination. METHODS: In a cohort of 100 MS patients, we genotyped 18 SNPs in the following genes: NAD synthetase 1,CYP2R1, vitamin D binding protein, vitamin D receptor, Retinoid X Receptor-alpha,KLOTHO, CYP24A1, and CYP27A1. Serum 25(OH)D3 levels were measured byhigh-performance liquid chromatography. Genotyping was performed by real-timepolymerase chain reaction or PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: We did not find any associationbetween SNPs, alone or in combination, and MS severity. CONCLUSION: In thisstudy, we make an initial evaluation of the possible influence of several SNPs invitamin D-related genes on MS severity.

TI  - Quercetin: A Molecule of Great Biochemical and Clinical Value and Its Beneficial Effect on Diabetes and Cancer.
LID - 37 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diseases10030037 [doi]
AB  - Quercetin belongs to the broader category of polyphenols. It is found, inparticular, among the flavonols, and along with kaempferol, myricetin andisorhamnetin, it is recognized as a foreign substance after ingestion in contrastto vitamins. Quercetin occurs mainly linked to sugars with the most commoncompounds being quercetin-3-O-glucoside or as an aglycone, especially in theplant population. The aim of this review is to present a recent bibliography onthe mechanisms of quercetin absorption and metabolism, bioavailability, andantioxidant and the clinical effects in diabetes and cancer. The literaturereports a positive effect of quercetin on oxidative stress, cancer, and theregulation of blood sugar levels. Moreover, research-administered drug dosages ofup to 2000 mg per day showed mild to no symptoms of overdose. It should be noted that quercetin is no longer considered a carcinogenic substance. The daily intakeof quercetin in the diet ranges 10 mg-500 mg, depending on the type of productsconsumed. This review highlights that quercetin is a valuable dietaryantioxidant, although a specific daily recommended intake for this substance has not yet been determined and further studies are required to decide a beneficialconcentration threshold.

TI  - Effect of Antioxidant Supplementation on Milk Yield and Quality in ItalianMediterranean Lactating Buffaloes.
LID - 1903 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12151903 [doi]
AB  - Buffaloes are raised mainly to obtain milk that is nutritionally very rich. Thetechnological characteristics of buffalo milk are optimal for processing intocheese, and it is mainly used to produce mozzarella cheese. Under stressfulconditions, buffaloes, like other animals, produce milk qualitatively poorly. Thestressors that can affect the quality of production are, in addition to otherfactors, deficiencies in nutrients such as vitamins, antioxidants, and minerals. In this study, we evaluated the effect of antioxidant supplementation on thequality of buffalo milk. Sixty-six buffaloes were enrolled and subdivided intotwo balanced groups of 33 each. The ZnSe group received 0.2 kg/head/day of BufaloPlus((R)) containing antioxidants and barley meal, CaCO3 and MgCO3 mix; thecontrol group was supplemented with 0.2 kg/head/day of barley meal, CaCO3 andMgCO3 mix. The two groups were fed ad libitum with a total mixed ration (TMR).The amount of diet distributed was recorded daily, and the residue in the trough manger was recorded three times per week. TMR samples were taken every two weeks for each group. Daily milk yield was recorded twice a week. Milk samples werecollected every four weeks and analysed for chemical and technologicalproperties. Furthermore, milk total antioxidant capacity was determined. Theresults obtained showed that the antioxidant supplement had no effect on feedintake, feeding behaviour, and feed efficiency. The treatment positivelyinfluenced milk production while it did not affect the chemical characteristicsof the milk. In addition, the supplement of antioxidants improved the milkclotting properties (MCP). The supplement did not affect the antioxidant activityof the milk.

LID - 10.3390/bios12080558 [doi]
AB  - Tumor accurate imaging can effectively guide tumor resection and accuratefollow-up targeted therapy. The development of imaging-stable, safe, andmetabolizable contrast agents is key to accurate tumor imaging. Herein,ultra-small and metabolizable dual-mode imaging probe Au/Gd@FA NCs is rationally engineered by a simple hydrothermal method to achieve accurate FL/MRI imaging of tumors. The probes exhibit ultra-small size (2.5-3.0 nm), near-infraredfluorescence (690 nm), high quantum yield (4.4%), and a better T1 nuclearmagnetic signal compared to commercial MRI contrast agents. By modifying thefolic acid (FA) molecules, the uptake and targeting of the probes are effectivelyimproved, enabling specific fluorescence imaging of breast cancer. Au/Gd@FA NCswith good biosafety were found to be excreted in the feces after imaging without affecting the normal physiological metabolism of mice. Intracellular reactiveoxygen species (ROS) increased significantly after incubation of Au/Gd@FA NCswith tumor cells under 660 nm laser irradiation, indicating that Au/Gd@FA NCs canpromote intracellular ROS production and effectively induce cell apoptosis. Thus,metabolizable Au/Gd@FA NCs provide a potential candidate probe for multimodalimaging and tumor diagnosis in clinical basic research. Meanwhile, Au/Gd@FA NCsmediated excessive intracellular production of ROS that could help promote tumor cell death.

TI  - Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensors with Magnetic Sandwich Hybrids for SignalAmplification.
LID - 554 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12080554 [doi]
AB  - The conventional signal amplification strategies for surface plasmon resonance(SPR) biosensors involve the immobilization of receptors, the capture of targetanalytes and their recognition by signal reporters. Such strategies work at theexpense of simplicity, rapidity and real-time measurement of SPR biosensors.Herein, we proposed a one-step, real-time method for the design of SPR biosensorsby integrating magnetic preconcentration and separation. The target analytes werecaptured by the receptor-modified magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), and then thebiotinylated recognition elements were attached to the analyte-bound MNPs to forma sandwich structure. The sandwich hybrids were directly delivered to theneutravidin-modified SPR fluidic channel. The MNPs hybrids were captured by thechip through the neutravidin-biotin interaction, resulting in an enhanced SPRsignal. Two SPR biosensors have been constructed for the detection of target DNA and beta-amyloid peptides with high sensitivity and selectivity. This work,integrating the advantages of one-step, real-time detection, multiple signalamplification and magnetic preconcentration, should be valuable for the detectionof small molecules and ultra-low concentrations of analytes.

LID - 10.1080/10717544.2022.2067600 [doi]
AB  - Non-small cell lung cancer comprises 85% of the global lung cancer cases.Conventional chemotherapeutics possess certain limitations like systemic toxicityand drug resistance that requires the development of new therapeutic agents forsuccessful treatment of lung cancer. Actinonin, a human peptide deformylaseinhibitor, has demonstrated anti-cancerous properties in various leukemias andsolid cancer types. However, it has limited therapeutic application because ofits low bioavailability and systemic toxicity if administered in free form. This limitation can be overcome by using nano-delivery systems that will increase the therapeutic efficacy of actinonin. In the present study, human serum albuminactinonin nanoparticles were prepared using a desolvation technique and folicacid was conjugated to lysine residues of albumin for effective delivery to thelung. The lung adenocarcinoma model was established 24 weeks afterintraperitoneal administration of urethane and chemotherapeutic efficacy of free as well as nanoencapsulated actinonin was evaluated. This study demonstratedanti-proliferative potential of folic acid conjugated human serum albuminnanoparticles encapsulating actinonin. The intraperitoneally administerednanoformulation exhibited sustain release profile of actinonin with longerhalf-life and mean retention time. The reduced dose frequency resulted intherapeutic efficacy comparable to free drug in vivo in terms of 100% survivaland reduced tumor burden along with downregulation of epidermal growth factorreceptor, folate receptor alpha and peptide deformylase expression in lungadenocarcinoma mice model. Therefore, actinonin encapsulated albuminnanoparticles-based therapy holds great potential as an alternative strategy toimprove its anti-cancerous activity against lung adenocarcinoma.

AB  - In the last two decades, numerous studies have been carried out to findcorrelations between vitamin D and the efficiency of the lungs and respiratorysystem. This study aimed to find the relationship of taking vitamin D with therisks of the severity of infection with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) andthe risk of infection of patients with chronic diseases. A total of 100 COVID-19 patients (61 males and 39 females) were included in the study and divided intogroups, namely never taken vitamin D and taken a dose of 50 and 1,000 IU. Theeffects of gender, chronic diseases (i.e., hypertension and diabetes), andrequiring intensive care unit (ICU) were evaluated. The results showed thatfemales were at lower risks of infection with COVID-19 than males and taking 50IU of vitamin D could lower the severe cases by 33%. It was also revealed thatpatients with chronic disease were more sensitive to COVID-19 and administering50 units of vitamin D in these patients decreased the need for ICU from 49% to9%. Given that vitamin D enhances the immune system and respiratory function, thefindings of this research indicated that vitamin D reduced the risk of COVID-19; however, it was not able to prevent it.

TI  - Hypoprothrombinemia During Cefmetazole Treatment: A Case Report.
PG  - e936712
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.936712 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Cefmetazole (CMZ), containing an N-methyl-tetrazole-thiol (NMTT) side chain, is a therapeutic option for diverticulitis in Japan. Cephems containing anNMTT, a methyl-thiadiazol, and a thiadiazolethiol side chain are known to induce coagulation disorders. CASE REPORT A 76-year-old woman developedhypoprothrombinemia after receiving oral levofloxacin (LVFX) 250 mg q24h for 2days followed by intravenous CMZ 2 g q8h for sigmoid diverticulitis. On day 5 of CMZ administration (after 12 doses in total), black stool was observed. On thefollowing day (after 14 doses), prothrombin time (PT) prolongation was noted; PT and international normalized ratio (INR) were 37.1 s and 2.47, respectively. Wediagnosed the patient with hypoprothrombinemia because of vitamin K deficiencycaused by markedly elevated protein levels induced by vitamin K absence orantagonist-II on day 6 of CMZ administration. Intravenous vitamin Kadministration and CMZ cessation rapidly restored PT and led to the disappearanceof black stool. CONCLUSIONS The causes of vitamin K deficiency were considered tobe an impaired vitamin K cycle due to CMZ and decreased vitamin K intake because of malnutrition. These findings are consistent with CMZ's reported adverseeffects. Decreased vitamin K production due to alterations in the gut bacterialflora by LVFX and CMZ was also postulated as a cause. If a bleeding tendency isnoted during diverticulitis treatment with NMTT-containing cephems, switching to intravenous quinolones or carbapenems is recommended. It remains unclear how thisreaction can be avoided; however, prudent monitoring of bleeding signs and PT-INRis recommended.

TI  - Distinct Binding Properties of Neutravidin and Streptavidin Proteins toBiotinylated Supported Lipid Bilayers: Implications for Sensor Functionalization.
LID - 5185 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22145185 [doi]
AB  - The exceptional strength and stability of noncovalent avidin-biotin binding iswidely utilized as an effective bioconjugation strategy in various biosensingapplications, and neutravidin and streptavidin proteins are two commonly usedavidin analogues. It is often regarded that the biotin-binding abilities ofneutravidin and streptavidin are similar, and hence their use is interchangeable;however, a deeper examination of how these two proteins attach to sensor surfacesis needed to develop reliable surface functionalization options. Herein, weconducted quartz crystal microbalance-dissipation (QCM-D) biosensing experiments to investigate neutravidin and streptavidin binding to biotinylated supportedlipid bilayers (SLBs) in different pH conditions. While streptavidin binding tobiotinylated lipid receptors was stable and robust across the tested pHconditions, neutravidin binding strongly depended on the solution pH and wasgreater with increasingly acidic pH conditions. These findings led us to propose a two-step mechanistic model, whereby streptavidin and neutravidin binding tobiotinylated sensing interfaces first involves nonspecific protein adsorptionthat is mainly influenced by electrostatic interactions, followed by structuralrearrangement of adsorbed proteins to specifically bind to biotin functionalgroups. Practically, our findings demonstrate that streptavidin is preferable to neutravidin for constructing SLB-based sensing platforms and can improve sensing performance for detecting antibody-antigen interactions.

LID - 10.3390/plants11141843 [doi]
AB  - Hippophae rhamnoides widely known as sea buckthorn berries (SB) are rich invitamins and phytonutrients. The subspecies ssp. sinensis and ssp. mongolica are highly valued for their medicinal properties and vitamin contents, hencedomesticated widely across Eurasia and Southeast Asia. Due to the frequent usage of these two subspecies, accurate identification is required to preventeconomically motivated adulteration. In this study, we report the singlenucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based molecular markers to easily distinguish thesetwo subspecies at 45S nrDNA region. From the determined 45S rDNA region, wedesigned two primers (5' sinensis and 5' mongolica) and developed a multiplex PCRprofile. The developed primers effectively distinguished the sea buckthornsubspecies in commercial products as well. Along with the development ofsubspecies specific primers, we have profiled vitamin contents from H. rhamnoidesssp. sinensis and ssp. mongolica and found ascorbic acid and riboflavin contents were high in both ssp. sinensis and spp. mongolica, yet the content of folic acidwas high only in ssp. mongolica. Thus, we provide species specific primers andvitamin profile as an effective authentication of H. rhamnoides.

LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics14071480 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, gastro-resistant microparticles (MPs) were produced usingthe spray-drying technique as controlled-release systems for some modelliposoluble vitamins, including retinyl-palmitate, retinyl-acetate,beta-carotene, cholecalciferol and alpha-tocopherol. The gastroprotective action of three different gastro-resistant excipients, the anionic methacrylic copolymer(Eudraguard((R)(R)) Biotic, E1207), the cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) andwhey proteins (WPs), was compared. The latter was used to produce a noveldelivery system manufactured with only food-derived components, such as milk, andshowed several improvements over the two synthetic gastro-resistant agents.Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed a quite homogeneous sphericalshape of all microparticle batches, with an average diameter between 7 and 15mum. FTIR analysis was used to evaluate the effective incorporation of vitaminswithin the microparticles and the absence of any degradation to the components ofthe formulation. The comparison graphs of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)confirmed that the spray drying technique generates a solid in which the physicalinteractions between the excipients and the vitamins are very strong. Releasestudies showed a prominent pH-controlled release and partially a delayed-release profile. Ex vivo permeation studies of retinyl palmitate, retinyl acetate andalpha-tocopherol revealed greater transmucosal permeation capacity formicroparticles produced with the WPs and milk.

TI  - Rapidly Increasing Serum 25(OH)D Boosts the Immune System, againstInfections-Sepsis and COVID-19.
LID - 2997 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142997 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is a global public health problem, a pandemic that commonly affects the elderly and those with comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes,hypertension, respiratory disorders, recurrent infections, immune deficiency, andmalignancies, as well as ethnic minorities living in temperate countries. Thesame groups were worst affected by COVID-19. Since vitamin D deficiency weakensthe immune system, it increases the risk of infections, complications, anddeaths, such as from sepsis and COVID-19. Deficiency can be remediedcost-effectively through targeted food fortification, supplementation, and/ordaily safe sun exposure. Its endocrine functions are limited to mineralmetabolism, musculoskeletal systems, specific cell membrane interactions, andparathyroid gland functions. Except for the rapid, endocrine, and cellmembrane-based non-genomic functions, all other biological and physiologicalactivities of vitamin D depend on the adequate intracellular synthesis of1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol) in peripheral target cells via the genome. Calcitriolmediates autocrine (intracrine) and paracrine signalling in immune cells, whichprovides broader, protective immune functions crucial to overcoming infections.The synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol) in peripheral target cells is dependent on diffusion and endocytosis of D3 and 25(OH)D from the circulation into them,which requires maintenance of serum 25(OH)D concentration above 50 ng/mL.Therefore, in acute infections such as sepsis and respiratory infections likeCOVID-19, it is necessary to rapidly provide its precursors, D3 and 25(OH)D,through the circulation to generate adequate intracellular calcitriol. Immunedefence is one of the crucial non-hormonal functions of vitamin D. A single oral (bolus) dose or divided upfront loading doses between 100,000 and 500,000 IU,using 50,000 IU vitamin D3 increase the serum 25(OH)D concentrations to atherapeutic level of above 50 ng/mL that lasts between two to three months. This takes three to five days to raise serum 25(OH)D. In contrast, a single oral dose of calcifediol (0.014 mg/kg body weight) can generate the needed 25(OH)Dconcentration within four hours. Considering both D3 and 25(OH)D enter immunecells for generating calcitriol, using the combination of D3 (medium-term) andcalcifediol (immediate) is cost-effective and leads to the best clinical outcome.To maximise protection against infections, particularly to reduceCOVID-19-associated complications and deaths, healthcare workers should advisepatients on safe sun exposure, adequate vitamin D supplementation and balanceddiets containing zinc, magnesium, and other micronutrients to support the immune system. Meanwhile, governments, the World Health Organisation, the Centers forDisease Control, and governments should consider similar recommendations tophysicians and the public, change the outdated vitamin D and other micronutrient recommendations directed to their population, and organise targetted foodfortification programs for the vulnerable groups. This article discusses arational approach to maintaining a sustained serum 25(OH)D concentration above 50ng/mL, necessary to attain a robust immune system for overcoming infections. Suchwould cost-effectively improve the population's health and reduce healthcarecosts. It also describes three cost-effective, straightforward protocols forachieving and sustaining therapeutic serum 25(OH)D concentrations above 50 ng/mL (&gt;125 nmol/L) to keep the population healthy, reduce absenteeism, improveproductivity, and lower healthcare costs.

AB  - This study recorded the dietary intakes of young male ice hockey players (10-13year (yr)) for 3 consecutive days while participating in a 5-day summer hockeycamp. Players were categorized as older children (OC, n = 10; 10.7 +/- 0.2 yr;37.1 +/- 1.5 kg; 147.9 +/- 2.1 cm) and young adolescents (YA, n = 10; 12.9 +/-0.1 yr; 45.2 +/- 1.5 kg; 157.0 +/- 2.4 cm). Players consumed their usual dailyintakes. Parents recorded food intake in the mornings and evenings, while theresearchers recorded food intake at camp. Energy intake was higher in both groupswhen compared to data for age-matched young Canadian (CDN) males (OC, 2967 +/-211 vs. 2000 kcal/day; YA, 2773 +/- 91 vs. 2250 kcal/day). Carbohydrate (CHO)(OC, 11.2 +/- 0.8 vs. YO, 8.9 +/- 0.5 g/kg body mass/day) and protein (OC, 3.2+/- 0.3; YO, 2.4 +/- 0.1 g/kg/day) intakes were higher than reported for youngCDN males (CHO, 3.6 and protein, 1.0 g/kg/day) and were within the AcceptableMacronutrient Distribution Range (AMDR; CHO, 56 +/- 2.3; 57.4 +/- 0.8%; protein, 16.1 +/- 1.0; 15.7 +/- 0.7%). Fat intake was also within the AMDR in both groups (OC, 29.8 +/- 1.6%; YA, 28.3 +/- 1.0%). Micronutrient intake was adequate except for Vitamin D intakes that were below the recommended 15 ug/day at 6.3 +/- 0.7(OC) and 5.0 +/- 1.5 ug/day (YA). In summary, energy and macronutrient intakes ofthe OC (10-11 yr) and YA (12-13 yr) players were high and well above the agematched CDN norms. The older children had higher energy intakes/kg body mass thanthe young adolescents. Higher energy intakes allowed for micronutrients intakesto be met in these young active males, except for vitamin D intake.

TI  - Citicoline/Coenzyme Q10/Vitamin B3 Fixed Combination Exerts SynergisticProtective Effects on Neuronal Cells Exposed to Oxidative Stress.
LID - 2963 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142963 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to investigate the rationale and efficacy of using a citicoline, coenzyme Q10 (CAVAQ10) and vitamin B3 fixed combination incombating inflammation and oxidation in neuronal cells exposed to oxidativestress. METHODS: HypoE22 cells and isolated hypothalamic specimens were selected as in vitro models to conduct the experiments. The efficacy of citicoline,CAVAQ10, and vitamin B3, with their fixed combination, were assayed after theexposure of hypothalamic cells to hydrogen peroxide (concentration range 1 nM-10 microM), in order to evaluate the biocompatibility of treatments. The activity ofneuroprotective and pro-inflammatory factors, namely, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), involved in the neuronal cell damage in neurodegenerative diseases, were assayed in isolated hypothalamus. RESULTS: Neither citicoline, CAVAQ10, nor vitamin B3significantly altered hypothalamic cell viability, thus suggesting thebiocompatibility of single ingredients and fixed combination in the concentrationrange considered for the study. In the same condition, citicoline and CAVAQ10were also effective in reducing the gene expression of monoaminoxidase-B,involved in dopamine degradation. However, only citicoline demonstrated anability to reduce dopamine levels. Conversely, all compounds were effective inreducing the gene expression of IL-6, and TNFalpha, and in inducing the geneexpression of BDNF, with the co-administration of citicoline/CAVAQ10/vitamin B3being generally more effective than single ingredients. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings support the beneficial and synergistic effects of citicoline, CAVAQ10,and vitamin B3 in fixed combination in reducing inflammation and oxidation, andin stimulating neurotrophin production in neuronal cells.

TI  - Profile of Folate in Breast Milk from Chinese Women over 1-400 Days Postpartum.
LID - 2962 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142962 [doi]
AB  - Folate is an essential nutrient for growth in early life. This study aimed todetermine the levels and compositions of folate in Chinese breast milk samples.This study was part of the Maternal Nutrition and Infant Investigation (MUAI)study. A total of 205 healthy mothers were randomly recruited in Chengdu over1-400 days postpartum. Five different species of folate, includingtetrahydrofolate (THF), 5-methyl-THF, 5,10-methenyl-THF,5-formyl-THF andunmetabolized folic acid (UMFA), were measured for liquid chromatography-tandemmass spectrometry (LC-MS). The median levels of total folate ranged from 12.86 to56.77 ng/mL in the breast milk of mothers at 1-400 days postpartum, graduallyincreasing throughout the lactating periods. The median levels of 5-methyl-THF,minor reduced folate (the sum of THF, 5,10-methenyl-THF and 5-formyl-THF) andUMFA were in the ranges of 8.52-40.65 ng/mL, 3.48-16.15 ng/mL and 0.00-1.24 ng/mLduring 1-400 days postpartum, respectively. 5-Methyl-THF accounted for more than 65% of the total folate in all breast milk samples. The levels of UMFA in mature breast milk samples were higher in supplement users than nonusers, but not forcolostrum and transitional milk samples (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the levelof total folate in the breast milk changed along with the prolonged lactatingperiods, but 5-methyl-THF remains the dominant species of folate in the breastmilk of Chinese populations across all entire lactating periods.

TI  - Ischemic Stroke and Dietary Vitamin B12 Deficiency in Old-Aged Females: Impaired Motor Function, Increased Ischemic Damage Size, and Changed Metabolite Profilesin Brain and Cecum Tissue.
LID - 2960 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142960 [doi]
AB  - A vitamin B12 deficiency (vit. B12 def.) is common in the elderly, because ofchanges in metabolism. Clinical studies have reported that a vit. B12 def.results in worse outcome after stroke, and the mechanisms through which a vit.B12 def. changes the brain requires further investigation. This studyinvestigated the role of vit. B12 def. on stroke outcome and mechanisms usingaged female mice. Eighteen-month-old females were put on a control or vit. B12def. diet for 4 weeks, after which an ischemic stroke was induced in thesensorimotor cortex. After damage, motor function was measured, the animals were euthanized, and tissues were collected for analysis. Vit. B12 def. animals hadincreased levels of total homocysteine in plasma and liver, and choline levelswere also increased in the liver. Vit. B12 def. animals had larger damage volume in brain tissue and more apoptosis. The cecum tissue pathway analysis showeddysfunction in B12 transport. The analysis of mitochondrial metabolomics in braintissue showed reduced levels of metabolites involved in the TCA cycle in vit. B12def. animals. Motor function after stroke was impaired in vit. B12 def. animals. A dietary vit. B12 def. impairs motor function through increased apoptosis andchanges in mitochondrial metabolism in brain tissue.

TI  - Vitamin A in Skin and Hair: An Update.
LID - 2952 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142952 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin A is a fat-soluble micronutrient necessary for the growth of healthy skinand hair. However, both too little and too much vitamin A has deleteriouseffects. Retinoic acid and retinal are the main active metabolites of vitamin A. Retinoic acid dose-dependently regulates hair follicle stem cells, influencingthe functioning of the hair cycle, wound healing, and melanocyte stem cells.Retinoic acid also influences melanocyte differentiation and proliferation in adose-dependent and temporal manner. Levels of retinoids decline when exposed toultraviolet irradiation in the skin. Retinal is necessary for thephototransduction cascade that initiates melanogenesis but the source of thatretinal is currently unknown. This review discusses new research on retinoids andtheir effects on the skin and hair.

TI  - Vitamin K2 Improves Osteogenic Differentiation by Inhibiting STAT1 via the Bcl-6 and IL-6/JAK in C3H10 T1/2 Clone 8 Cells.
LID - 2934 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142934 [doi]
AB  - Osteogenic activity of vitamin K2 (VK2), a small molecular nutrient, has beensuggested. However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated.Therefore, this study aimed to explore the mechanisms by which VK2 promotesosteogenic differentiation. The effects of VK2 on osteogenic differentiationindicators were determined in C3H10 T1/2 clone 8 cells. The RNA-seq analysis was used to explore the hypothesis that VK2 promotes osteogenic differentiation.Small interfering RNA (siRNA) assay and plasmid transfection assay were used todetermine the potential role of VK2 in the modulation of Bcl-6/STAT axis andIL-6/JAK/STAT signaling pathway. VK2 significantly increased alkaline phosphatase(ALP) activity, ALP, osteocalcin (OCN), and RUNX2 abundance, and RUNX2 proteinexpression. RNA-seq analysis showed that there were 314 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) upregulated and 1348 DEGs downregulated by VK2. PPI analysisdetermined the top 10 hub genes upregulated or downregulated by VK2.Overexpression of Bcl-6 increased osteogenic differentiation and decreasedexpression of STAT1. Administration with VK2 restored the inhibition by siBcl-6in osteogenic differentiation. Knockdown of IL-6 decreased the mRNA levels ofgenes associated with the JAK/STAT signaling pathway, and increased markers ofosteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, treatment with VK2 improved inhibitionin osteogenic differentiation and decreased enhancement of JAK/STAT signalingpathway related genes by overexpression of IL-6. Our study suggests that VK2could improve osteogenic differentiation via the Bcl-6/STAT axis andIL-6/JAK/STAT signaling pathway.

LID - 10.3390/nu14142932 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes mellitus has become a troublesome and increasingly widespread condition.Treatment strategies for diabetes prevention in high-risk as well as in affected individuals are largely attributed to improvements in lifestyle and dietarycontrol. Therefore, it is important to understand the nutritional factors to beused in dietary intervention. A decreased risk of diabetes is associated withdaily intake of millet-based foods. Pearl millet is a highly nutritious grain,nutritionally comparable and even superior in calories, protein, vitamins, andminerals to other large cereals, although its intake is confined to lower income segments of society. Pearl millet contains phenolic compounds which possessantidiabetic activity. Thus, it can be used to prepare a variety of food productsfor diabetes mellitus. Moreover, it also has many health benefits, includingcombating diabetes mellitus, cancer, cardiovascular conditions, decreasing tumouroccurrence, lowering blood pressure, heart disease risk, cholesterol, and fatabsorption rate. Therefore, the current review addresses the role of pearl milletin managing diabetes.

TI  - Anthropometrics, Hemoglobin Status and Dietary Micronutrient Intake amongTanzanian and Mozambican Pigeon Pea Farmers.
LID - 2914 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142914 [doi]
AB  - Inadequate consumption of micronutrient-dense and protein-rich foods such asvegetables, legumes and meat is an important contributing cause for anemia anddeficiencies of vitamin A and iron in rural communities of Tanzania andMozambique. A cross-sectional study was conducted to assess the nutritionalstatus (anthropometrics and hemoglobin) and diets in particular micronutrientintake of female and male pigeon pea farmers from Lindi, Tanzania, and Gurue, theZambezia province of Mozambique. A total of 1526 farmers (669 from Tanzania, 857 from Mozambique) were studied, of whom 16% were overweight and 35% were anemic.The highest prevalence of overweight and anemia, at 35% and 48%, was observed in Tanzanian and Mozambican women, respectively. Overall, only a small proportion ofwomen and men reached the recommended daily dietary intake of vitamin A (10%),iron (51%) and zinc (44%). Multiple regression models revealed that dark greenleafy vegetables (DGLVs) highly predicted vitamin A intake, whereas legumes inTanzania and starchy plants in Mozambique were actually the dominant sources ofvitamin A. Cereals covered over half of the iron and the zinc intake in bothcountries. An increased consumption of micronutrient-rich DGLVs and legumes,while reducing the high amounts of refined maize or polished rice, is suggestedto counteract the high prevalence of anemia and overweight among smallholderfarmers in East and South Eastern Africa.

TI  - Food Supplement Use Differs from the Recommendations in Pregnant Women: AMultinational Survey.
LID - 2909 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142909 [doi]
AB  - The aim was to investigate, among pregnant women, (1) the use of food supplementsand (2) the awareness of food supplement recommendations and beliefs about foodsupplement use in four European countries: Finland, Italy, Poland, and the UnitedKingdom. The participants (n = 1804) completed an online questionnaire withpredefined statements. Daily intakes of vitamins and minerals were calculatedusing uploaded pictures or weblinks of the supplement packages. Countrydifferences were assessed. Most participants (91%) used at least one foodsupplement during pregnancy. A prenatal multivitamin was the most commonly usedsupplement type (84% of the users), and 75% of the participants thoughtconsumption of multivitamin is recommended. Of the participants, 81% knew thatfolic acid is recommended during pregnancy while 58% knew the recommendation for vitamin D. In 19% of the supplement users, the daily safe upper intake limit ofat least one nutrient was exceeded. Nevertheless, most participants agreed thatthey knew which supplements (91%) and doses of supplements (87%) needed to beused during pregnancy. To conclude, the majority of the participants used foodsupplements, but lower proportions knew and adhered to the recommended intakes.Between-country differences were observed in the use and knowledge of and beliefsregarding supplements. The results suggest a need for assessment and monitoringof supplement use in antenatal care to ensure appropriate use.

LID - 10.3390/nu14142898 [doi]
AB  - Poor sleep status is associated with several health problems. Nutritionalbiomarkers and factors related to poor sleep are understudied. This study aimedto identify nutrition biomarkers and factors related to sleep status in healthyyoung Saudi females. The study included 92 normal-weight and obese Saudi females aged 19-25. Fasting blood glucose, insulin, and lipid profiles were measured.Insulin resistance was calculated on the basis of the homeostasis modelassessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) method. Anthropometric, stress,physical activity, and dietary data were collected. Data on the polyphenolcontent in foods were retrieved from the Phenol-Explorer database. The sleepstatus was assessed using the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI). Associationsbetween variables were assessed using the multiple logistic regression model.Around 76% of the participants had poor sleep status (PSQI &gt; 5). Multiplelogistic regression reported high polyphenol intake as a protective factoragainst poor sleep (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.07-0.83; p = 0.03) and HOMA-IR as anindependent risk for poor sleep (OR 4.97; 95% CI 1.11-22.31; p = 0.04). Othernutritional biomarkers and factors, such as BMI, lipid profile, and vitamins,revealed a trend but were not significant. In conclusion, poor sleep status isassociated with insulin resistance and low polyphenol intake among women ofreproductive age.

LID - 10.3390/nu14142896 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder of variable severity, characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, andrestricted or repetitive patterns of thought and behavior. In 2018, the incidenceof ASD was 2.4 times higher than estimated in 2000. Behavior and braindevelopment abnormalities are present in the complex disorder of ASD. Nutritionalstatus plays a key role in the incidence and severity of the core symptoms ofASD. The aim of this study was to review the available peer-reviewed studies thatevaluated the relationship between amino acids, choline, B vitamins, and ASDincidence and/or severity of symptoms. Through examining plasma profiles, urinesamples, and dietary intake, researchers found that low choline, abnormal aminoacid, and low B vitamin levels were present in children with ASD compared tothose without ASD. The evidence supports the need for future research thatimplements simultaneous supplementation of all essential nutrients in individualswith ASD and among prenatal mothers. Future evidence could lead to scientificbreakthroughs, ultimately reducing the rates of ASD incidence and severity ofsymptoms by applying nutritional interventions in at-risk populations.

TI  - Biomarkers Regulated by Lipid-Soluble Vitamins in Glioblastoma.
LID - 2873 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142873 [doi]
AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM), a highly lethal form of adult malignant gliomas with littleclinical advancement, raises the need for alternative therapeutic approaches.Lipid-soluble vitamins have gained attention in malignant brain tumors owing totheir pleiotropic properties and their anti-cancer potential have been reportedin a number of human GBM cell lines. The aim of this paper is to systematicallyreview and describe the roles of various biomarkers regulated by lipid-solublevitamins, such as vitamins A, D, E, and K, in the pathophysiology of GBM.Briefly, research articles published between 2005 and 2021 were systematicallysearched and selected from five databases (Scopus, PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASEvia Ovid, and Web of Science) based on the study's inclusion and exclusioncriteria. In addition, a number of hand-searched research articles identifiedfrom Google Scholar were also included for the analysis. A total of 40differentially expressed biomarkers were identified from the 19 eligible studies.The results from the analysis suggest that retinoids activate celldifferentiation and suppress the biomarkers responsible for stemness in human GBMcells. Vitamin D appears to preferentially modulate several cell cyclebiomarkers, while vitamin E derivatives seem to predominantly modulate biomarkersrelated to apoptosis. However, vitamin K1 did not appear to induce anysignificant changes to the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling or apoptotic pathways in humanGBM cell lines. From the systematic analysis, 12 biomarkers were identified that may be of interest for further studies, as these were modulated by one or two of these lipid-soluble vitamins.

TI  - Vitamin D Derivatives in Acute Myeloid Leukemia: The Matter of Selecting theRight Targets.
LID - 2851 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142851 [doi]
AB  - Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive and often fatal hematopoieticmalignancy. A very attractive way to treat myeloid leukemia, called"differentiation therapy", was proposed when in vitro studies showed that somecompounds are capable of inducing differentiation of AML cell lines. One of thedifferentiation-inducing agents, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which can inducegranulocytic differentiation in AML cell lines, has been introduced into clinics to treat patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) in which a PML-RARAfusion protein is generated by a chromosomal translocation. ATRA has greatlyimproved the treatment of APL. Since 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) is capableof inducing monocytic differentiation of leukemic cells, the idea of treatingother AMLs with vitamin D analogs was widely accepted. However, early clinicaltrials in which cancer patients were treated either with 1,25D or with analogsdid not lead to conclusive results. Recent results have shown that AML types withcertain mutations, such as isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations, may be theright targets for differentiation therapy using 1,25D, due to upregulation ofvitamin D receptor (VDR) pathway.

TI  - Vitamin D and Its Receptor from a Structural Perspective.
LID - 2847 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142847 [doi]
AB  - The activities of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25D3, are mediated via itsbinding to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Numerous studies havedemonstrated the important role of 1,25D3 and VDR signaling in various biologicalprocesses and associated pathologies. A wealth of information about ligandrecognition and mechanism of action by structural analysis of the VDR complexesis also available. The methods used in these structural studies were mainly X-raycrystallography complemented by NMR, cryo-electron microscopy and structural massspectrometry. This review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge ofVDR structures and also to explore the recent progress in understanding thecomplex mechanism of action of 1,25D3 from a structural perspective.

TI  - Effect of Carotenoids on Paraoxonase-1 Activity and Gene Expression.
LID - 2842 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142842 [doi]
AB  - Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is an antioxidant enzyme attached to HDL with ananti-atherogenic potential. It protects LDL and HDL from lipid peroxidation. The enzyme is sensitive to various modulating factors, such as genetic polymorphisms as well as pharmacological, dietary (including carotenoids), and lifestyleinterventions. Carotenoids are nutritional pigments with antioxidant activity.The aim of this review was to gather evidence on their effect on the modulationof PON1 activity and gene expression. Carotenoids administered as naturallyoccurring nutritional mixtures may present a synergistic beneficial effect onPON1 status. The effect of carotenoids on the enzyme depends on age, ethnicity,gender, diet, and PON1 genetic variation. Carotenoids, especially astaxanthin,beta-carotene, and lycopene, increase PON1 activity. This effect may be explainedby their ability to quench singlet oxygen and scavenge free radicals.beta-carotene and lycopene were additionally shown to upregulate PON1 geneexpression. The putative mechanisms of such regulation involve PON1 CpG-richregion methylation, Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKKII) pathwayinduction, and upregulation via steroid regulatory element-binding protein-2(SREBP-2). More detailed and extensive research on the mechanisms of PON1modulation by carotenoids may lead to the development of new targeted therapiesfor cardiovascular diseases.

LID - 2835 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142835 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is considered a major public health problem worldwide andhas been reported as having an association with depression. However, studies onthe association between vitamin D deficiency and depressive symptoms in secondaryamenorrhea (SA) patients are still scarce. This study examined the relationshipbetween serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and depressive symptoms among Korean women with SA. In this cross-sectional observational study, 78 patientswith SA were initially recruited. Clinical and biochemical parameters, including serum 25(OH)D level, were measured. Data from 63 SA patients who met the studyinclusion criteria and completed psychiatric assessments were finally analyzed.We analyzed their association with depression using a hierarchical regressionmodel. The average serum 25(OH)D level was 34.40 +/- 24.02 ng/mL, and 41.3% ofthe women with SA were vitamin D-deficient (&lt;20 ng/mL). The total score of theKorean version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (K-HDRS) was negativelyrelated to serum 25(OH)D levels, free testosterone, and serum anti-Mullerianhormone (AMH) after adjusting for age and BMI (r = -0.450, p &lt; 0.001; r =-0.258, p = 0.045; and r = -0.339, p = 0.006, respectively). Serum 25(OH)D levelsand AMH levels were the most powerful predictors of depressive severity whenusing the K-HDRS in SA patients (beta = -0.39, p &lt; 0.005; beta = -0.42, p &lt;0.005, respectively). This study showed that low serum 25(OH)D levels wereassociated with the severity of depressive symptoms in SA patients. Thisobservation suggests that the evaluation of vitamin D deficiency for the risk of depression may be necessary in patients with SA.

LID - 10.3390/nu14142831 [doi]
AB  - This study was aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of inositol nutritionalsupplementation during pregnancy for the prevention of GDM. PubMed, Embase,MEDLINE, and Cochrane library were systematically searched for randomizedcontrolled trails (RCTs) in this field until May 2022. Primary outcomes were the incidence for GDM and plasma glucose levels by oral glucose tolerance test(OGTT). Pooled results were expressed as relative risk (RR) or mean difference(MD) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Seven RCTs with 1321 participantswere included in this study. Compared with the control group, 4 g myo-inositol(MI) supplementation per day significantly decreased the incidence of GDM (RR =0.30, 95% CI (0.18, 0.49), p &lt; 0.00001). It significantly decreased the plasmaglucose levels of OGTT regarding fasting-glucose OGTT (MD = -4.20, 95% CI (-5.87,-2.54), p &lt; 0.00001), 1-h OGTT (MD = -8.75, 95% CI (-12.42, -5.08), p &lt;0.00001), and 2-h OGTT (MD = -8.59, 95% CI (-11.81, -5.83), p &lt; 0.00001). Italso decreased the need of insulin treatment, and reduced the incidence ofpreterm delivery and neonatal hypoglycemia. However, no difference was observedbetween 1.1 g MI per day plus 27.6 mg D-chiro-inositol (DCI) per day and thecontrol group regarding all evaluated results. In conclusion, 4 g MI nutritional supplementation per day during early pregnancy may reduce GDM incidence andseverity, therefore may be a practical and safe approach for the prevention ofGDM.

LID - 10.3390/nu14142825 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin B12 (VB12) is a micronutrient that is essential for DNA synthesis andcellular energy production. We recently demonstrated that VB12 oralsupplementation coordinates ileal epithelial cells (iECs) and gut microbiotafunctions to resist pathogen colonization in mice, but it remains unclear whetherVB12 directly modulates the cellular homeostasis of iECs derived from humans.Here, we integrated transcriptomic, metabolomic, and epigenomic analyses toidentify VB12-dependent molecular and metabolic pathways in human iEC microtissuecultures. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that VB12 notably activated genesinvolved in fatty acid metabolism and epithelial cell proliferation whilesuppressing inflammatory responses in human iECs. Untargeted metabolite profilingdemonstrated that VB12 facilitated the biosynthesis of amino acids and methylgroups, particularly S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), and supported the function ofthe mitochondrial carnitine shuttle and TCA cycle. Further, genome-wide DNAmethylation analysis illuminated a critical role of VB12 in sustaining cellularmethylation programs, leading to differential CpG methylation of genes associatedwith intestinal barrier function and cell proliferation. Together, these findingssuggest an essential involvement of VB12 in directing the fatty acid andmitochondrial metabolisms and reconfiguring the epigenome of human iECs topotentially support cellular oxygen utilization and cell proliferation.

TI  - B Vitamins and Incidence of Advanced Age-Related Macular Degeneration: TheAlienor Study.

LID - 10.3390/nu14142821 [doi]
AB  - B vitamins may protect against age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Weevaluated the associations of dietary intake and serum vitamins with theincidence of advanced AMD in the Alienor study. The Alienor study is aprospective population-based cohort of 963 residents of Bordeaux, France, whowere 73 years or older at baseline (2006-2008). Examinations were performed everytwo years over an eight-year period. The incidence of AMD is based on retinalfundus photographs and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography examinations.Among the 861 included participants, 93 developed incident AMD during a medianfollow-up time of 9.8 years. Participants with normal serum folate (>/=10 nmol/L)significantly had a 51% reduced risk for AMD in the fully adjusted Cox model (HR,0.49 [95% CI, 0.25-0.95], p = 0.036). Participants with a higher dietary intakeof B5 and B6 vitamins had a lower risk for developing AMD of up to 28% (HR, 0.72 for 1-SD increase [0.53-0.99], p = 0.049; HR, 0.90 [0.81-0.99], p = 0.049,respectively). This cohort study of older adults suggests a strong associationbetween a normal serum folate status, a high dietary intake of B5 and B6 and alower risk for developing advanced AMD. Adopting a healthy diet rich in Bvitamins may help to reduce vision loss due to AMD.

AB  - We estimated the usual intakes of fiber, iron, zinc, calcium, folate, vitamin D, and vitamin A and the top foods that contribute to them among children in theUAE. Dietary intake was assessed using 24 h recalls among 5 age groups of infantsand children. Foods were clustered into 54 food groups and ranked by theirpercentage contribution to the nutrients of interest in this study. Thepercentage achieving the adequate intake (AI) of fiber was negligible among allchildren. The top source of fiber was vegetables among children under 4 years,and white breads among those over 4 years. Only 45% of infants achieved ironadequacy, but iron standards were met by most children beyond the age of 1. Themain contributors to iron intake were infant/young child formula and baby cereal in children under 4 years, while children over 4 years obtained it primarily fromgrains (fortified) and meat/fish. Vitamin D was inadequate across all age groups,with the percentage achieving adequacy ranging from 0 to 19% amongpre-adolescents and toddlers, respectively. The top sources of vitamin D werefortified milks. Overall, nutrient inadequacies in fiber, calcium, and vitamin D highlight the need for greater intakes of whole grains and fortified dairyproducts in the UAE.

TI  - The Use of Dietary Supplements and Amino Acid Restriction Interventions to ReduceFrailty in Pre-Clinical Models.
LID - 2806 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14142806 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is a state of accelerated aging that increases susceptibility to adverse health outcomes. Due to its high societal and personal costs, there is growinginterest in discovering beneficial interventions to attenuate frailty. Many ofthese interventions involve the use of lifestyle modifications such as dietarysupplements. Testing these interventions in pre-clinical models can facilitateour understanding of their impact on underlying mechanisms of frailty. Weconducted a narrative review of studies that investigated the impact of dietarymodifications on measures of frailty or overall health in rodent models. Theseinterventions include vitamin supplements, dietary supplements, or amino acidrestriction diets. We found that vitamins, amino acid restriction diets, anddietary supplements can have beneficial effects on frailty and other measures of overall health in rodent models. Mechanistic studies show that these effects are mediated by modifying one or more mechanisms underlying frailty, in particulareffects on chronic inflammation. However, many interventions do not measurefrailty directly and most do not investigate effects in both sexes, which limits their applicability. Examining dietary interventions in animal models allows for detailed investigation of underlying mechanisms involved in their beneficialeffects. This may lead to more successful, translatable interventions toattenuate frailty.

AB  - As the most common cancer in women, efforts have been made to develop novelnanomedicine-based therapeutics for breast cancer. In the present study, the insilico curcumin (Cur) properties were investigated, and we found some importantdrawbacks of Cur. To enhance cancer therapeutics of Cur, three different nonionicsurfactants (span 20, 60, and 80) were used to prepare various Cur-loadedniosomes (Nio-Cur). Then, fabricated Nio-Cur were decorated with folic acid (FA) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) for breast cancer suppression. For PEG-FA@Nio-Cur, the gene expression levels of Bax and p53 were higher compared to free drug andNio-Cur. With PEG-FA-decorated Nio-Cur, levels of Bcl2 were lower than the freedrug and Nio-Cur. When MCF7 and 4T1 cell uptake tests of PEG-FA@Nio-Cur andNio-Cur were investigated, the results showed that the PEG-FA-modified niosomesexhibited the most preponderant endocytosis. In vitro experiments demonstratethat PEG-FA@Nio-Cur is a promising strategy for the delivery of Cur in breastcancer therapy. Breast cancer cells absorbed the prepared nanoformulations andexhibited sustained drug release characteristics.

AB  - Vitamin E consists of a group of compounds including alpha- beta- gamma- anddelta-tocopherols and alpha- beta- gamma- and delta-tocotrienols, containing the chroman-6-ol system. The recognition of the structural and dynamic properties of this system, present in all vitamers, seems to be important for the fullexplanation of the mechanism of the biological activity of vitamin E. This paper presents results of the structural analysis of the chosen 6-chromanyl etherealderivatives using experimental ((13) C NMR-in solution and solid state, as wellas variable temperature experiments; single crystal X-ray diffraction) andtheoretical (DFT) methods. For one of the studied compounds,2,2,5,7,8-pentamethyl-6-((tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)oxy) chroman, the splitting ofsome signals was observed in the (13)C dynamic NMR spectra. This observation was explained by the application of a conformational analysis and subsequent DFToptimization, followed by the calculation of NMR properties.

LID - 4606 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144606 [doi]
AB  - A nicotinamide-based derivative was designed as an antiproliferative VEGFR-2inhibitor with the key pharmacophoric features needed to interact with theVEGFR-2 catalytic pocket. The ability of the designed congener((E)-N-(4-(1-(2-(4-benzamidobenzoyl)hydrazono)ethyl)phenyl)nicotinamide),compound 10, to bind with the VEGFR-2 enzyme was demonstrated by moleculardocking studies. Furthermore, six various MD simulations studies established the excellent binding of compound 10 with VEGFR-2 over 100 ns, exhibiting optimumdynamics. MM-GBSA confirmed the proper binding with a total exact binding energy of -38.36 Kcal/Mol. MM-GBSA studies also revealed the crucial amino acids in the binding through the free binding energy decomposition and declared theinteractions variation of compound 10 inside VEGFR-2 via the Protein-LigandInteraction Profiler (PLIP). Being new, its molecular structure was optimized by DFT. The DFT studies also confirmed the binding mode of compound 10 with theVEGFR-2. ADMET (in silico) profiling indicated the examined compound's acceptablerange of drug-likeness. The designed compound was synthesized through thecondensation of N-(4-(hydrazinecarbonyl)phenyl)benzamide withN-(4-acetylphenyl)nicotinamide, where the carbonyl group has been replaced by an imine group. The in-vitro studies were consonant with the obtained in silicoresults as compound 10 prohibited VEGFR-2 with an IC50 value of 51 nM. Compound10 also showed antiproliferative effects against MCF-7 and HCT 116 cancer celllines with IC50 values of 8.25 and 6.48 muM, revealing magnificent selectivityindexes of 12.89 and 16.41, respectively.

TI  - Metabolic Profiling and Transcriptional Analysis of Carotenoid Accumulation in a Red-Fleshed Mutant of Pummelo (Citrus grandis).
LID - 4595 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144595 [doi]
AB  - Citrus grandis 'Tomentosa', commonly known as 'Huajuhong' pummelo (HJH), is used in traditional Chinese medicine and can moisten the lungs, resolve phlegm, andrelieve coughs. A spontaneous bud mutant, named R-HJH, had a visually attractive phenotype with red albedo tissue and red juice sacs. In this study, the contentand composition of carotenoids were investigated and compared between R-HJH andwild-type HJH using HPLC-MS analysis. The total carotenoids in the albedo tissue and juice sacs of R-HJH were 4.03- and 2.89-fold greater than those in HJH,respectively. The massive accumulation of carotenoids, including lycopene,beta-carotene and phytoene, led to the attractive red color of R-HJH. However,the contents of flavones, coumarins and most volatile components (mainlyD-limonene and gamma-terpinene) were clearly reduced in R-HJH compared withwild-type HJH. To identify the molecular basis of carotenoid accumulation inR-HJH, RNA-Seq transcriptome sequencing was performed. Among 3948 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), the increased upstream synthesis genes (phytoene synthasegene, PSY) and decreased downstream genes (beta-carotene hydroxylase gene, CHYBand carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene, CCD7) might be the key factors thataccount for the high level of carotenoids in R-HJH. These results will bebeneficial for determining the molecular mechanism of carotenoid accumulation andmetabolism in pummelo.

Three commercially availableformulations containing EM were used: a formulation containing Bifidobacterium,Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Bacillus, and Rhodopseudomonasbacteria and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; a formulation containingStreptomyces, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, Cellulomonas, Arthrobacter,Paenibacillusa, and Pseudonocardia bacteria; and a formulation containing eightstrains of Bacillus bacteria, B. megaterium, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. pumilus, B.licheniformis, B. coagulans, B. laterosporus, B. mucilaginosus, and B. polymyxa. It was demonstrated that those formulations influenced degradation of herbicides.All studied formulations containing EM reduced the diflufenican degradationlevel, from 35.5% to 38%, due to an increased acidity of the soil environment andincreased durability of that substance at lower pH levels. In the case offlurochloridone, all studied EM formulations increased degradation of that activesubstance by 19.3% to 31.2% at the most. For control samples, equationsdescribing kinetics of diflufenican and flurochloridone elimination were plotted,and a time of the half-life of these substances in laboratory conditions wascalculated, amounting to 25.7 for diflufenican and 22.4 for flurochloridone.

AB  - Roasting is a key step for preparing sesame oil that leads to important changesin its organoleptic properties and quality. In this study, white sesame seedswere roasted for 20 min in an electric oven at different temperatures (120, 150, 180, 210, 250 and 300 degrees C). The oils extracted from unroasted and roastedseeds were compared for their chemical composition: fatty acids (including trans isomers), phytosterols, lignans (sesamin and sesamolin), tocopherols and totalphenolic compounds, as well as their oxidative stability and antiradicalcapacity. There were no obvious differences in the oil densities, refractiveindexes or iodine values, but the saponification values were affected bytemperature. Relevant primary and secondary lipid oxidation were observed at T&gt; 250 degrees C, resulting in a higher p-anisidine value and K232 as well asK268 values. Roasting improved oil yield (from 33.5 to 62.6%), increased itsinduction period (from 5.5 to 10.5 h) and enhanced the total phenolic content(from 152 to 194 mg/100 g) and antiradical activity of the extracted oil.Depending on roasting temperature, a gradual decline was recorded in totalamounts of phytosterols (up to 17.4%), gamma-tocopherol (up to 10.6%), sesamolin (maximum of 27.5%) and sesamin (maximum of 12.5%). All the investigated oilspresented a low quantity in triglyceride polymers, clearly below the maximumtolerated quantity according to the European regulation. The optimal roastingtemperature for obtaining high nutritional grade oil within the permissiblevalues was 210 degrees C. The unsaponifiable components (including lignans andsterols) extracted from roasted seeds have been shown to be natural additives to fresh meatball products to extend shelf life. The results of this study may help to boost the nutritional content of plant-based diets by allowing for the use of roasted sesame seed oil and its components.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27144459 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin B12, only found naturally in animal-based foods, is essential for brainfunctions and various chemical reactions in the human body. Insufficient vitamin B12 leads to vitamin B12 deficiency, common among strict vegetarians due to theirlimited intake of animal-based foods. Nevertheless, extensive studies havedemonstrated that macroalgae, specifically the Ulva lactuca species, are rich in vitamin B12 and could be further exploited in future dietary applications. In thecurrent study, the ideal extraction method of vitamin B12 from dried U. lactucawas developed and optimised to achieve the maximum vitamin B12 yield. The effectsof several extraction parameters, including the solvent-to-solvent,methanol:water (MeOH:H2O), and solute-to-solvent ratios, and pH on the totalvitamin B12 content were analysed through a two-level factorial and centralcomposite design. The highest vitamin B12 content, particularly cyanocobalamin(CN-Cbl), was recovered through the ultrasonic-assisted extraction (UAE) ofoven-dried U. lactuca at 3 g:60 mL of solute-to-solvent and 25:75% of MeOH to H2Oratios at pH 4. The extraction of CN-Cbl from oven-dried U. lactuca that employedthe UAE method has elevated CN-Cbl content recovery compared to other extraction methods.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27144410 [doi]
AB  - Fungicides containing active ingredients of boscalid and pyraclostrobin have beenwidely applied in watermelon disease control. To provide data for avoiding healthhazards caused by fungicides, we investigated its terminal residues and evaluatedthe dietary risk. In this work, watermelon samples were collected from fieldsites in six provinces and analyzed with high-performance liquidchromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The average recoveries ofboscalid and pyraclostrobin in the watermelon matrix were 97-108% and 93-103%,respectively, with the relative standard deviations (RSDs) </= 9.1%. The limitsof quantifications (LOQs) were 0.01 and 0.005 mg/kg for boscalid andpyraclostrobin. Twenty-one days after applying the test pesticide with 270 ga.i./ha, the terminal residues of boscalid and pyraclostrobin were all below 0.05mg/kg and below the maximum residue limits (MRLs) recommended by European FoodSafety Authority (EFSA). According to the national estimated daily intake (NEDI),the risk quotients (RQs) of boscalid and pyraclostrobin were 48.4% and 62.6%,respectively. That indicated the pesticide evaluated in watermelon exhibited alow dietary risk to consumers. All data provide a reference for the MRLestablishment of boscalid in watermelon for China.

TI  - Mechanism Study on Nanoparticle Negative Surface Charge Modification by Ascorbyl Palmitate and Its Improvement of Tumor Targeting Ability.
LID - 4408 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144408 [doi]
AB  - Surface charge polarity and density influence the immune clearance and cellularuptake of intravenously administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), thus determiningthe efficiency of their delivery to the target. Here, we modified the surfacecharge with ascorbyl palmitate (AsP) used as a negatively charged lipid.AsP-PC-LNPs were prepared by dispersion and ultrasonication of AsP andphosphatidylcholine (PC) composite films at various ratios. AsP inserted into thePC film with its polar head outward. The pKa for AsP was 4.34, and its ion formconferred the LNPs with negative surface charge. Zeta potentials were correlated with the amount and distribution of AsP on the LNPs surface. DSC, Raman and FTIR spectra, and molecular dynamics simulations disclosed that AsP distributedhomogeneously in PC at 1-8% (w/w), and there were strong hydrogen bonds betweenthe polar heads of AsP and PC (PO(2-)), which favored LNPs' stability. But atAsP:PC &gt; 8% (w/w), the excessive AsP changed the interaction modes between AsPand PC. The AsP-PC composite films became inhomogeneous, and their phasetransition behaviors and Raman and FTIR spectra were altered. Our resultsclarified the mechanism of surface charge modification by AsP and provided arational use of AsP as a charged lipid to modify LNP surface properties intargeted drug delivery systems. Furthermore, AsP-PC composites were used asphospholipid-based biological membranes to prepare paclitaxel-loaded LNPs, which had stable surface negative charge, better tumor targeting and tumor inhibitoryeffects.

TI  - Tetrazine-Induced Bioorthogonal Activation of Vitamin E-Modified siRNA for GeneSilencing.
LID - 4377 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27144377 [doi]
AB  - The temporal activation of siRNA provides a valuable strategy for the regulation of siRNA activity and conditional gene silencing. The bioorthogonal bond-cleavagereaction of benzonorbonadiene and tetrazine is a promising trigger in siRNAtemporal activation. Here, we developed a new method for the bio-orthogonalchemical activation of siRNA based on the tetrazine-induced bond-cleavagereaction. Small-molecule activatable caged siRNAs were developed with the5'-vitamin E-benzonobonadiene-modified antisense strand targeting the greenfluorescent protein (GFP) gene and the mitotic kinesin-5 (Eg5) gene. The additionof tetrazine triggered the reaction with benzonobonadiene linker and induced the linker cleavage to release the active siRNA. Additionally, the conditional genesilencing of both exogenous GFP and endogenous Eg5 genes was successfullyachieved with 5'-vitamin E-benzonobonadiene-caged siRNAs, which provides a newuncaging strategy with small molecules.

TI  - The Di-Symbiotic Systems in the Aphids Sipha maydis and Periphyllus lyropictusProvide a Contrasting Picture of Recent Co-Obligate Nutritional Endosymbiosis in Aphids.
LID - 1360 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071360 [doi]
AB  - Dependence on multiple nutritional bacterial symbionts forming a metabolic unithas repeatedly evolved in many insect species that feed on nutritionallyunbalanced diets such as plant sap. This is the case for aphids of thesubfamilies Lachninae and Chaitophorinae, which have evolved di-symbiotic systemsin which the ancient obligate nutritional symbiont Buchnera aphidicola ismetabolically complemented by an additional nutritional symbiont acquired morerecently. Deciphering how different symbionts integrate both metabolically andanatomically in such systems is crucial to understanding how complex nutritional symbiotic systems function and evolve. In this study, we sequenced and analyzedthe genomes of the symbionts B. aphidicola and Serratia symbiotica associatedwith the Chaitophorinae aphids Sipha maydis and Periphyllus lyropictus. Ourresults show that, in these two species, B. aphidicola and S. symbioticacomplement each other metabolically (and their hosts) for the biosynthesis ofessential amino acids and vitamins, but with distinct metabolic reactionssupported by each symbiont depending on the host species. Furthermore, the S.symbiotica symbiont associated with S. maydis appears to be strictlycompartmentalized into the specialized host cells housing symbionts in aphids,the bacteriocytes, whereas the S. symbiotica symbiont associated with P.lyropictus exhibits a highly invasive phenotype, presumably because it is capableof expressing a larger set of virulence factors, including a complete flagellumfor bacterial motility. Such contrasting levels of metabolic and anatomicalintegration for two S. symbiotica symbionts that were recently acquired asnutritional co-obligate partners reflect distinct coevolutionary processesspecific to each association.

LID - 10.3390/microorganisms10071330 [doi]
AB  - Iron deficiency anemia (IDA) is very common and affects approximately 1/3 of the world's human population. There are strong research data that some probiotics,such as Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium longum improve ironabsorption and influence the course of anemia. Furthermore, prebiotics, includinggalactooligosaccharides (GOS) and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), increase ironbioavailability and decrease its destructive effect on the intestinal microbiota.In addition, multiple postbiotics, which are probiotic metabolites, includingvitamins, short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), and tryptophan, are involved in theregulation of intestinal absorption and may influence iron status in humans. Thisreview presents the actual data from research studies on the influence ofprobiotics, prebiotics, and postbiotics on the prevention and therapy of IDA and the latest findings regarding their mechanisms of action. A comparison of thelatest research data and theories regarding the role of pre-, post-, andprobiotics and the mechanism of their action in anemias is also presented anddiscussed.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are neurodevelopmental disorders that clinicallypresented as impaired social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and weakenedcommunication. The use of bee pollen as a supplement rich in amino acids aminoacids, vitamins, lipids, and countless bioactive substances may lead to therelief of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, glutamate excitotoxicity, andimpaired neurochemistry as etiological mechanisms autism. Thirty young maleWestern albino rats were randomly divided as: Group I-control; Group II, in whichautism was induced by the oral administration of 250 mg propionic acid/kg bodyweight/day for three days followed by orally administered saline until the end ofexperiment and Group III, the bee pollen-treated group, in which the rats weretreated with 250 mg/kg body weight of bee pollen for four weeks before autism wasinduced as described for Group II. Markers related to oxidative stress,apoptosis, inflammation, glutamate excitotoxicity, and neurochemistry weremeasured in the brain tissue. Our results indicated that while glutathioneserotonin, dopamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), GABA/Glutamate ratio, andvitamin C were significantly reduced in propionic acid-treated group (p &lt;0.05), glutamate, IFN-gamma, IL-1A, IL-6, caspase-3, and lipid peroxide levelswere significantly elevated (p &lt; 0.05). Bee pollen supplementationdemonstrates protective potency presented as amelioration of most of the measuredvariables with significance range between (p &lt; 0.05)-(p &lt; 0.001).

TI  - Vitamins C and D and COVID-19 Susceptibility, Severity and Progression: AnEvidence Based Systematic Review.
LID - 941 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/medicina58070941 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objectives: Starting in early December 2019, the novel CoronavirusDisease (COVID-19) from infection with COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic.Many aspects of its pathogenesis and related clinical consequences are stillunclear. Early diagnosis and dynamic monitoring of prognostic factors areessential to improve the ability to manage COVID-19 infection. This study aimedto provide an account of the role played by vitamins C and D on the onset,progression and severity of COVID-19. Clinical features and infection-relatedrisk factors are also briefly discussed. Material and Methods: In March 2022, themain online databases were accessed. All the articles that investigate thepossible role of vitamins C and D on COVID-19 susceptibility, severity andprogression were considered. Results: The current evidence on vitamin C and Dsupplementation in patients with COVID-19 infection is inconsistent andcontroversial. In some studies, vitamins were used as coadjuvant of a formalexperimental therapy, while in others as main treatment. Ethnicity and hospitalsetting (inpatient/outpatient) were also variable. Moreover, there was noconsensus between studies in administration protocol: high heterogeneity indosage, administration, and duration of the treatment were evident. Finally, somestudies administered vitamins pre- and/or during COVID infection, in patientswith different risk factors and infection severity. Conclusions: While waiting todevelop a targeted, safe and effective therapy, it is important to investigateindividual predisposition and proper disease management. Concluding, availabledata on the use of nutraceuticals in COVID-19 are inconsistent. However, there isa lack of evidence-based guidelines which recommend vitamin C and Dsupplementation in patients with COVID-19, and results from high qualityrandomised controlled trials (RCTs) are inconsistent. Current investigations sofar are mostly observational, and include a relatively small sample size whichcan lead to biased results. Large-scale multicentre studies are therefore needed.

LID - 10.3390/life12071049 [doi]
AB  - Vitamins are widely found in nature, for example, in plants and fruits. Ascorbic acid and nicotinamide are examples of these compounds that have potentantioxidant properties, besides stimulating collagen production and depigmenting properties that protect the skin from premature aging. To overcome the skinbarrier and reduce the instability of antioxidant compounds, alternative systems have been developed to facilitate the delivery of antioxidants, making themefficiently available to the tissue for an extended time without causing damageor toxicity. The objective of this study was to obtain chitosan biodegradablemicroparticles containing ascorbic acid and nicotinamide for topical delivery.The microparticles were obtained by spray drying and characterized chemically by means of scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and differential exploratory calorimetry. The drugs were successfullyencapsulated and the microparticles showed positive zeta potential. In vitrorelease assays showed a sustained release profile. The evaluation of ex vivo skinpermeation and retention demonstrated low permeation and adequate retention ofthe compounds in the epidermis/dermis, suggesting the efficient delivery from theobtained microparticles. Antibacterial assays have shown that microparticles can inhibit the growth of microorganisms in a time- and dose-dependent manner,corroborating their use in cosmetic products for application on the skin.

LID - 1012 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12071012 [doi]
AB  - During pregnancy, appropriate nutritional support is necessary for thedevelopment of the foetus. Maternal nutrition might protect the foetus from toxicagents such as free radicals due to its antioxidant content. In this study, 90mothers and their children were recruited. DNA damage mediated by oxidativestress (OS) was determined by the levels of 8-hidroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the plasma of women and umbilical cord blood. The mothers and newborns werecategorised into tertiles according to their 8-OHdG levels for furthercomparison. No relevant clinical differences were observed in each group. Astrong correlation was observed in the mother-newborn binomial for 8-OHdG levels (Rho = 0.694, p &lt; 0.001). In the binomial, a lower level of 8-OHdG wasassociated with higher consumption of calories, carbohydrates, lipids, andvitamin A (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the levels of 8-OHdG were onlysignificantly lower in newborns from mothers with a higher consumption of vitaminA and E (p &lt; 0.01). These findings were confirmed by a significant negativecorrelation between the 8-OHdG levels of newborns and the maternal consumption ofvitamins A and E, but not C (Rho = -0.445 (p &lt; 0.001), -0.281 (p = 0.007), and-0.120 (p = 0.257), respectively). Multiple regression analysis showed that the8-OHdG levels in mothers and newborns inversely correlated with vitamin A (beta =-1.26 (p = 0.016) and -2.17 (p &lt; 0.001), respectively) and pregestational bodymass index (beta = -1.04 (p = 0.007) and -0.977 (p = 0.008), respectively). Inconclusion, maternal consumption of vitamins A and E, but not C, might protectnewborns from DNA damage mediated by OS.

TI  - Prospective Role of Bioactive Molecules and Exosomes in the Therapeutic Potentialof Camel Milk against Human Diseases: An Updated Perspective.
LID - 990 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life12070990 [doi]
AB  - Camel milk (CM) constitutes an important dietary source in the hot and aridregions of the world. CM is a colloidal mixture of nutritional components(proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, and minerals) and non-nutritionalcomponents (hormones, growth factors, cytokines, immunoglobulins, and exosomes). Although the majority of previous research has been focused on the nutritionalcomponents of CM; there has been immense interest in the non-nutritionalcomponents in the recent past. Reckoning with these, in this review, we haveprovided a glimpse of the recent trends in CM research endeavors and attempted toprovide our perspective on the therapeutic efficacy of the nutritional andnon-nutritional components of CM. Interestingly, with concerted efforts from the research fraternities, convincing evidence for the better understanding of theclaimed traditional health benefits of CM can be foreseen with great enthusiasmand is indeed eagerly anticipated.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23147845 [doi]
AB  - The microsomal cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and mitochondrial cytochrome P45024A1 (CYP24A1) hydroxylating enzymes both metabolize vitamin D and its analogs.The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the full-length native human CYP3A4 hasbeen solved, but the respective structure of the main vitamin D hydroxylatingCYP24A1 enzyme is unknown. The structures of recombinant CYP24A1 enzymes havebeen solved; however, from studies of the vitamin D receptor, the use of atruncated protein for docking studies of ligands led to incorrect results. As thestructure of the native CYP3A4 protein is known, we performed rigid dockingsupported by molecular dynamic simulation using CYP3A4 to predict the metabolicconversion of analogs of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D2 (1,25D2). This is highlyimportant to the design of novel vitamin D-based drug candidates of reasonablemetabolic stability as CYP3A4 metabolizes ca. 50% of the drug substances. The useof the 3D structure data of human CYP3A4 has allowed us to explain thesubstantial differences in the metabolic conversion of the side-chain geometricanalogs of 1,25D2. The calculated free enthalpy of the binding of an analog of1,25D2 to CYP3A4 agreed with the experimentally observed conversion of the analogby CYP24A1. The metabolic conversion of an analog of 1,25D2 to the main vitamin Dhydroxylating enzyme CYP24A1, of unknown 3D structure, can be explained by thebinding strength of the analog to the known 3D structure of the CYP3A4 enzyme.

AB  - Minerals are required for the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy andregulation of fetal growth in mammals. Lentiviral-mediated RNA interference(RNAi) of chorionic somatomammotropin hormone (CSH) results in both anintrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and a non-IUGR phenotype in sheep. Thisstudy determined the effects of CSH RNAi on the concentration and uptake ofcalcium, phosphate, and vitamin D, and the expression of candidate mRNAs known tomediate mineral signaling in caruncles (maternal component of placentome) andcotyledons (fetal component of placentome) on gestational day 132. CSH RNAiNon-IUGR pregnancies had a lower umbilical vein-umbilical artery calcium gradient(p &lt; 0.05) and less cotyledonary calcium (p &lt; 0.05) and phosphate (p &lt;0.05) compared to Control RNAi pregnancies. CSH RNAi IUGR pregnancies had lessumbilical calcium uptake (p &lt; 0.05), lower uterine arterial and venousconcentrations of 25(OH)D (p &lt; 0.05), and trends for lower umbilical 25(OH)Duptake (p = 0.059) compared to Control RNAi pregnancies. Furthermore, CSH RNAiIUGR pregnancies had decreased umbilical uptake of calcium (p &lt; 0.05), lessuterine venous 25(OH)D (vitamin D metabolite; p = 0.055), lower caruncularexpression of SLC20A2 (sodium-dependent phosphate transporter; p &lt; 0.05) mRNA,and lower cotyledonary expression of KL (klotho; p &lt; 0.01), FGFR1 (fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; p &lt; 0.05), FGFR2 (p &lt; 0.05), and TRPV6 (transientreceptor potential vanilloid member 6; p &lt; 0.05) mRNAs compared to CSH RNAiNon-IUGR pregnancies. This study has provided novel insights into the regulatory role of CSH for calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D utilization in late gestation.

TI  - In Vitro Strategy for the Enhancement of the Production of Bioactive Polyphenols in Transformed Roots of Salvia bulleyana.
LID - 7771 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147771 [doi]
AB  - The underground parts of Salvia bulleyana, a rare Chinese plant species, havelong been used in traditional Chinese medicine. The Rhizobiumrhizogenes-transformed root culture obtained from this plant might be a promisingnovel source of valuable phenolics, including rosmarinic acid. The present study identifies for the first time, the optimal growth conditions of S. bulleyanahairy roots regarding production efficiency. The comprehensive optimizationcomprised cultivation in different basal media (B5, SH, MS, and WP) with full-and half-strength macro- and microelements, different vitamin contents (full,half, one-quarter part, and without) and sucrose concentrations (2, 3, 4, 5%),and under different light conditions: in dark, under blue LED (lambda = 430 nm), red LED (lambda = 670 nm), mixed blue and red LED (30%:70%), and white LED(390-670 nm). Hairy root growth and bioactive compound accumulation were alsodetailed every five days over the 50-day culture cycle. The optimal conditionswere determined using a technique for order preference by similarity to the idealsolution (TOPSIS). The most efficient combination for root growth and polyphenol content was found to be (1/2)SH liquid medium with half vitamin concentration and3% sucrose when grown in the dark. The biomass yield during the growth cycle was 6.1 g (fresh weight-FW) and 0.92 g (dry weight-DW) on one Erlenmeyer flask: a14.3-fold increase in FW and 16.1-fold increase in DW in relation to theinoculum. The highest mean total phenolic content was 93.6 mg/g DW includingabout 70 mg/g DW rosmarinic acid, reached on day 40 of culture; compared to rootsof two-year-old plants grown under field conditions, the total phenolic acidcontent was four times higher and rosmarinic acid eight times higher. Theobtained results place the investigated culture among the best hair root culturesfor rosmarinic acid production.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23147706 [doi]
AB  - Microglial cells can contribute to Alzheimer's disease by triggering aninflammatory response that leads to neuronal death. In addition, the presence of amyloid-beta in the brain is consistent with alterations in the blood-brainbarrier integrity and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) permeation. In thepresent work, we used lab-made TRL as carriers of lipophilic bioactive compounds that are commonly present in dietary oils, namely oleanolic acid (OA),alpha-tocopherol (AT) and beta-sitosterol (BS), to assess their ability tomodulate the inflammatory response of microglial BV-2 cells. We show thattreatment with lab-made TRL increases the release and gene-expression ofIL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, as well as NO and iNOS in microglia. On the other hand, TRL revealed bioactive compounds alpha-tocopherol and beta-sitosterol assuitable carriers for oleanolic acid. The inclusion of these biomolecules in TRL reduced the release of proinflammatory cytokines. The inclusion of thesebiomolecules in TRL reduced the release of proinflammatory cytokines. AT reduced IL-6 release by 72%, OA reduced TNF-alpha release by approximately 50%, and allthree biomolecules together (M) reduced IL-1beta release by 35% and TNF-alpharelease by more than 70%. In addition, NO generation was reduced, with theinclusion of OA by 45%, BS by 80% and the presence of M by 88%. Finally, arecovery of the basal glutathione content was observed with the inclusion of OAand M in the TRL. Our results open the way to exploiting theneuro-pharmacological potential of these lipophilic bioactive compounds throughtheir delivery to the brain as part of TRL.

TI  - Endothelium-Dependent Induction of Vasculogenic Mimicry in Human Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells Is Inhibited by Calcitriol and Curcumin.
LID - 7659 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147659 [doi]
AB  - In highly aggressive tumors, cancer cells may form channel-like structuresthrough a process known as vasculogenic mimicry (VM). VM is generally associated with metastasis, mesenchymal phenotype, and treatment resistance. VM can bedriven by antiangiogenic treatments and/or tumor microenvironment-derivedfactors, including those from the endothelium. Curcumin, a turmeric product,inhibits VM in some tumors, while calcitriol, the most active vitamin Dmetabolite, exerts potent antineoplastic effects. However, the effect of thesenatural products on VM in breast cancer remains unknown. Herein, we studied theeffect of both compounds on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) VM-capacity in aco-culture model. The process of endothelial cell-induced VM in two human TNBCcell lines was robustly inhibited by calcitriol and partially by curcumin.Calcitriol promoted TNBC cells' morphological change from spindle-like tocobblestone-shape, while curcumin diminished VM 3D-structure. Notably, thetreatments dephosphorylated several active kinases, especially those involved in the PI3K/Akt pathway. In summary, calcitriol and curcumin disruptedendothelium-induced VM in TNBC cells partially by PI3K/Akt inactivation andmesenchymal phenotype inhibition. Our results support the possible use of thesenatural compounds as adjuvants for VM inactivation in patients with malignanttumors inherently capable of forming VM, or those with antiangiogenic therapy,warranting further in vivo studies.

TI  - Nicotinamide Mononucleotide and Coenzyme Q10 Protects Fibroblast SenescenceInduced by Particulate Matter Preconditioned Mast Cells.
LID - 7539 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23147539 [doi]
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) pollutants impose a certain degree of destruction andtoxicity to the skin. Mast cells in the skin dermis could be activated by PMsthat diffuse across the blood vessel after being inhaled. Mast cell degranulationin the dermis provides a kind of inflammatory insult to local fibroblasts. Inthis study, we evaluated human dermal fibroblast responses to conditioned medium from KU812 cells primed with PM. We found that PM promoted the production ofproinflammatory cytokines in mast cells and that the cell secretome inducedreactive oxygen species and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production indermal fibroblasts. Nicotinamide mononucleotide or coenzyme Q10 alleviated thegeneration of excessive ROS and mitochondrial ROS induced by the conditionedmedium from PM-activated KU812 cells. PM-conditioned medium treatment increasedthe NF-kappaB expression in dermal fibroblasts, whereas NMN or Q10 inhibited p65 upregulation by PM. The reduced sirtuin 1 (SIRT 1) and nuclear factor erythroid2-related Factor 2 (Nrf2) expression induced by PM-conditioned medium wasreversed by NMN or Q10 in HDFs. Moreover, NMN or Q10 attenuated the expression ofsenescent beta-galactosidase induced by PM-conditioned KU812 cell medium. Thesefindings suggest that NMN or Q10 ameliorates PM-induced inflammation by improvingthe cellular oxidative status, suppressing proinflammatory NF-kappaB, andpromoting the levels of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory regulators Nrf2 andSIRT1 in HDFs. The present observations help to understand the factors thataffect HDFs in the dermal microenvironment and the therapeutic role of NMN andQ10 as suppressors of skin aging.

TI  - Osteoporosis among Postmenopausal Women in Jordan: A National Cross-SectionalStudy.
LID - 8803 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148803 [doi]
AB  - Osteoporosis is considered a widespread health problem that affects seniorcitizens, particularly older women, after the menopause. This national studyaimed to estimate the prevalence of osteoporosis among Jordanian postmenopausalwomen and to determine the association of demographic and nutritional factors,such as calcium and vitamin D supplement intake, with osteoporosis inpostmenopausal women. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 884postmenopausal women aged >/=50 years. A multistage sampling technique was usedto select participants from three geographic regions of Jordan (north, middle,and south). The data were collected from the participants by a team of fieldresearchers comprising men and women through a standard questionnaire. Theprevalence of osteoporosis was 19.8% among postmenopausal Jordanian women. Thestudy results showed that age (p < 0.001), geographic region (p = 0.019),occupation (p = 0.002), and educational level (p = 0.001) were significantlyassociated with osteoporosis. Moreover, osteoporosis was significantly associatedwith calcium and vitamin D supplement intake (p &lt; 0.05). There is a highprevalence of osteoporosis among postmenopausal Jordanian women. Therefore, thereis a need to educate women at this age, and probably at an earlier age, toprevent or reduce the development of osteoporosis.

TI  - Vitamin D Levels in Children with Recurrent Acute Tonsillitis in Jordan: ACase-Control Study.
LID - 8744 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148744 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D is essential for many functions of the body. In addition toits primary function of regulating the absorption of calcium in the smallintestine, its role in the immune system has recently been studied. The currentstudy aimed to test the impact of vitamin D deficiency on the rate of recurrentacute tonsillitis in children. METHODS: According to Paradise criteria, twohundred forty-two children with recurrent acute tonsillitis were recruited. Agroup of healthy children (n = 262) was also recruited as controls. Poissonregression was run to predict the number of tonsillitis episodes per year basedon vitamin D levels. The mean vitamin D level in the study group was lower thanin the control group (p &lt; 0.0001). Poisson regression of the rate of recurrenttonsillitis and vitamin D level (OR = 0.969 (95% CI, 0.962-0.975)) showed thatfor every single unit increase in vitamin D level, there was a 3.1% decrease inthe number of tonsillitis episodes per year (p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: VitaminD deficiency is associated with higher rates of recurrent acute tonsillitis.Future controlled trials should investigate the role of vitamin D supplementationin reducing the rate of recurrent tonsillitis.

TI  - Vitamin Supplementation in Pre-Pregnancy and Pregnancy among Women-Effects andInfluencing Factors in Romania.
LID - 8503 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148503 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to identify the consumption of vitamin andfolic acid supplements before and during pregnancy in a group of post-partumwomen (Romanian, Hungarian, and Roma) from Mures County, Romania, and theinfluence of socio-economic and behavioral factors on the consumption ofvitamins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional questionnaire-based studyincluded 1278 post-partum women (during the three days of hospitalization forbirth), average age 29.5, registered for giving birth in the three hospitals inMures County, 2015-2016. RESULTS: In our sample, 69.58% of the interviewed women did not use any vitamin and folic acid supplements before pregnancy, while 30.70%did not use vitamin supplements during pregnancy. The lack of vitaminsupplementation during pregnancy was associated with the low birth weight(&lt;2500 g) of newborns (OR = 2.4, 95% CI [1.6-3.8]) and birth at under 36 weeksof gestation (OR = 0.5, 95% CI [0.2-0.8]). CONCLUSION: The use of vitaminsupplements, including folic acid, continues to be deficient among Romanian womenbefore getting pregnant, as well as during their pregnancy. We observed a lack ofvitamin supplementation for pregnant women even if they were influenced by riskfactors. This highlights the importance of promoting the benefits of vitaminsupplementation equally among all subjects.

TI  - The Effect of the Long-Term Calcipotriol/Betamethasone Dipropionate Local Therapyon Tissue Resident Memory Cells Markers in Psoriatic Eruptions.
LID - 8345 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148345 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The natural course of psoriasis is characterized by the long-termpersistence of lesions and a predilection for relapse in the same area. It iscaused by the inherence of TRM (tissue resident memory T cells) in apparentlyhealthy skin. These cells are able to initiate an inflammatory cascade and inducerelapse of the disease. These cells are characterized by high resistance todamaging factors and apoptosis, which determines their longevity. AIM: The aim ofour study was to evaluate the presence of TRM in psoriatic plaques before, duringand after 12 weeks of therapy in patients treated with topical calcipotriol andbetamethasone dipropionate (Cal/BD) foam. METHODS: TRM markers (CD4, CD8, CD103, CD69, CD49, CXCR6) and tissue expression of cytokines (IL-17A, IL-22) in thelesional psoriatic skin from 10 patients compared to 10 healthy skin samples wereestimated by immunohistochemistry. Biopsy samples from the area of the samepsoriatic plaque were collected three times: before the initiation of therapy, 4 and 12 weeks after its initiation. RESULTS: The presence of TRM markers in theepidermis and dermis of psoriatic lesions was significantly higher when compared to the skin of control group patients. A reduction in the expression of thecharacteristic TRM markers (CD8, CD4, CD103, CD69, CXCR6, IL-17A and IL-22) wasobserved in the epidermis on week 12 of therapy, while a depletion in theexpression of TRM in the dermis was demonstrated only in CD4 and IL-22.CONCLUSIONS: Topical treatment with Cal/BD foam significantly decreased theexpression of TRM markers mainly in the epidermis, and to a lesser extent in the dermis, during the 12-week observation period. It probably results from a worsepenetration of the drug into the dermis and the effect of the preparation mainly on the epidermis. The persistence of a high expression of TRM markers in thedermis may result in the rapid recurrence of lesions after discontinuation oftopical treatment.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph19148242 [doi]
AB  - This study was conducted to explore the relationship between anemia and falls in postmenopausal women. The relationships between energy, protein, iron, andvitamin C intake were also checked. The data of this study are a combination ofdata from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES)collected from the KNHANES VI-2,3 (2014-2015) and VII-1,2,3 (2016-2018). Fallsand anemia were compared according to the subjects' characteristics. Phi andCramer's V coefficient were applied to find the strength of association. Energy, protein, iron, and vitamin C intake and anemia were investigated. Therelationship between the status as anemic and the occurrence of falls wasanalyzed using binary logistic regression. Of the 6665 subjects, 274 had a fall, and 596 had anemia. If the energy intake did not meet the estimated energyrequirements, the state of anemia was significantly higher with a weakassociation. When protein, iron, and vitamin C did not meet the recommendednutrient intake, the anemia state was considerably higher with a weak to moderateassociation. Postmenopausal women with anemia were more likely to fall thansubjects without anemia (OR = 1.88, p = 0.003). Additionally, anemia wasconfirmed to be related to insufficient energy, protein, iron, and vitamin Cintake.

AB  - Beans are legumes that play extremely important roles in human nutrition, servingas good sources of protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. In this study, we tried to elucidate the genetic diversity and population structure of 40Turkish bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) local varieties and 5 commercial cultivarscollected from 8 different locations in Erzurum-Ispir by using inter-primarybinding site (iPBS) retrotransposon markers. For molecular characterization, the 26 most polymorphic iPBS primers were used; 52 bands per primer and 1350 bands intotal were recorded. The mean polymorphism information content was 0.331. Variousdiversity indices, such as the mean effective allele number (0.706), meanShannon's information index (0.546), and gene diversity (0.361) revealed thepresence of sufficient genetic diversity in the germplasm examined. Molecularanalysis of variance (AMOVA) revealed that 67% of variation in bean germplasm wasdue to differences within populations. In addition, population structure analysisexposed all local and commercial bean varieties from five sub-populations.Expected heterozygosity values ranged between 0.1567 (the fourth sub-population) and 0.3210 (first sub-population), with an average value of 0.2103. In contrary, population differentiation measurement (Fst) was identified as 0.0062 for thefirst sub-population, 0.6372 for the fourth subpopulations. This is the firststudy to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of beangermplasm in Erzurum-Ispir region using the iPBS-retrotransposon marker system.Overall, the current results showed that iPBS markers could be used consistently to elucidate the genetic diversity of local and commercial bean varieties andpotentially be included in future studies examining diversity in a largercollection of local and commercial bean varieties from different regions.

TI  - Overexpression of an Inositol Phosphorylceramide Glucuronosyltransferase GeneIbIPUT1 Inhibits Na(+) Uptake in Sweet Potato Roots.
LID - 1140 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes13071140 [doi]
AB  - IPUT1 is a glycosyltransferase capable of synthesizing the glycosyl inositolphosphorylceramide (GIPC) sphingolipid. The GIPC sphingolipid is a Na(+) receptoron cell membranes which can sense extracellular Na(+) concentrations, promote theincrease in intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations, and plays critical roles inmaintaining intracellular Na(+) balance. Therefore, the IPUT1 gene plays animportant role in the genetic improvement of crop salt tolerance. Herein, theIbIPUT1 gene, which encodes an ortholog of Arabidopsis AtIPUT1, from sweet potatowas cloned. Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated in vivo transgenic technology,non-invasive micro-measuring technology (NMT) and Na(+) fluorescence imagingtechnology were then combined to quickly study the potential function of IbIPUT1 in salt tolerance. The data showed that IbIPUT1 was involved in the regulation ofroot cell Na(+) balance, and the overexpression of IbIPUT1 could not promotesweet potato root cell Na(+) efflux under salt stress, but it could significantlyinhibit the Na(+) absorption of root cells, thereby reducing the accumulation of Na(+) in root cells under salt stress. Additionally, Ca(2+) efflux in transgenic root cells was slightly higher than that in control roots under salt stress.Collectively, an efficient transgenic method for gene function studies wasestablished, and our results suggested that IbIPUT1 acts as a candidate gene for the genetic enhancement of sweet potato salt tolerance.

TI  - Specific Microbial Communities Are Selected in Minimally-Processed Fruit andVegetables according to the Type of Product.
LID - 2164 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142164 [doi]
AB  - Fruits and vegetables (F&V) products are recommended for the daily diet due totheir low caloric content, high amount of vitamins, minerals and fiber.Furthermore, these foods are a source of various phytochemical compounds, such aspolyphenols, flavonoids and sterols, exerting antioxidant activity. Despite thebenefits derived from eating raw F&V, the quality and safety of these productsmay represent a source of concern, since they can be quickly spoiled and have avery short shelf-life. Moreover, they may be a vehicle of pathogenicmicroorganisms. This study aims to evaluate the bacterial and fungal populations in F&V products (i.e., iceberg lettuces, arugula, spinaches, fennels, tomatoesand pears) by using culture-dependent microbiological analysis andhigh-throughput sequencing (HTS), in order to decipher the microbial populations that characterize minimally-processed F&V. Our results show that F&V harbordiverse and product-specific bacterial and fungal communities, with vegetablesleaf morphology and type of edible fraction of fruits exerting the highestinfluence. In addition, we observed that several alterative (e.g., Pseudomonasand Aspergillus) and potentially pathogenic taxa (such as Staphylococcus andCladosporium) are present, thus emphasizing the need for novel product-specificstrategies to control the microbial composition of F&V and extend theirshelf-life.

LID - 2154 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11142154 [doi]
AB  - Carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) is an evergreen tree that belongs to the Leguminosaefamily and grows in the arid and semi-arid regions of the Mediterranean basin.The carob tree is resistant to droughts and salinity, while its deep root systemsallow CO2 to sink, mitigating global warming effects. Traditionally, carob hasbeen used to produce animal feed, but for many years, it was excluded from thehuman diet. Nowadays, agricultural and industrial sectors exploit carob fruit,also referred to as carob pod, and its primary products (i.e., flour, powder and syrup) to develop a variety of foods and beverages. The nutritional compositionvaries depending on the carob part but also on genetic, cultivar, seasonal andenvironmental factors. Despite the high sugar content, the carob pod is rich ininsoluble fiber and microconstituents including phenolic compounds, inositols(mainly d-pinitol) and vitamins. In the present review article, we aimed to (a)highlight the role of carob cultivation in addressing climate change challengesand the need for sustainability, and (b) summarize the effects of carobconsumption on obesity and related metabolic disorders.

AB  - Legumes and pulses are nutrient-dense foods providing a good source of protein,complex carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, minerals, and bioactive compounds. Tobreed a new lineage of beans with specific nutritional and health beneficialpurposes, more information on original lineage beans must be obtained. However,data concerning the nutritive compositions, total phenolic contents (TPCs), andhealth benefits regarding the antioxidant potentials of some original lineagebeans in Thailand remain scarce, causing difficulty in decisional selection tobreed a new lineage. Thus, this study aimed to examine the nutritional values(proximate compositions, vitamins, and minerals), TPCs, and antioxidantactivities of ten original lineage bean cultivars in Glycine, Phaseolus, andVigna genera from Genebank, Department of Agriculture (DOA), Thailand. Theresults indicated that beans in the Glycine genus potentially provided higherenergy, protein, fat, and calcium contents than other genera, while the Phaseolusgenus tended to provide higher carbohydrate and dietary fiber. Specifically, limabean cultivar '38' exhibited high vitamin B1, and red kidney bean cultivar '112' exhibited high potassium content. Beans in the Vigna genus exhibited high TPCsand antioxidant activities. However, their nutritional compositions were markedlyvaried. The results of this work could support bean consumption as a feasiblealternative diet and be used as a reference for future bean breeding (within the same genera) of a new lineage with particular nutritional requirements and healthpotentials.

TI  - Highly Sensitive Plasmonic Waveguide Biosensor Based on PhaseSingularity-Enhanced Goos-Hanchen Shift.
LID - 457 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/bios12070457 [doi]
AB  - The detection for small molecules with low concentrations is known to bechallenging for current chemical and biological sensors. In this work, wedesigned a highly sensitive plasmonic biosensor based on the symmetric metalcladding plasmonic waveguide (SMCW) structure for the detection of biomolecules. By precisely designing the configuration and tuning the thickness of the guiding layer, ultra-high order modes can be excited, which generates a steep phasechange and a large position shift from the Goos-Hanchen effect (with respect torefractive index changes). This position shift is related to the sharpness of theoptical phase change from the reflected signal of the SPR sensing substrate andcan be directly measured by a position sensor. Based on our knowledge, this isthe first experimental study done using this configuration. Experimental results showed a lateral position signal change &gt; 90 microm for glycerol with asensitivity figure-of-merit of 2.33 x 10(4) microm/RIU and more than 15 micromfor 10(-4) M biotin, which is a low molecular weight biomolecule (less than 400Da) and difficult to be detected with traditional SPR sensing techniques. Throughintegrating the waveguide with a guiding layer, a strong improvement in theelectric field, as well as sensitivity have been achieved. The lateral positionshift has been further improved from 14.17 microm to 284 microm compared withconventional SPR substrate with 50 nm gold on single side. The as-reportedsensing technique allows for the detection of ultra-small biological moleculesand will play an important role in biomedical and clinical diagnostics.

LID - 10.3390/antiox11071366 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 infection can cause a severe respiratory distress syndrome withinflammatory and thrombotic complications, the severity of which increases withpatients' age and presence of comorbidity. The reasons for an age-dependentincrease in the risk of severe COVID-19 could be many. These include defects inthe homeostatic processes that control the cellular redox and its pivotal role insustaining the immuno-inflammatory response to the host and the protectionagainst oxidative stress and tissue degeneration. Pathogens may take advantage ofsuch age-dependent abnormalities. Alterations of the thiol redox balance in thelung tissue and lining fluids may influence the risk of infection, and the hostcapability to respond to pathogens and to avoid severe complications. SARS-CoV-2,likewise other viruses, such as HIV, influenza, and HSV, benefits in itsreplication cycle of pro-oxidant conditions that the same viral infection seemsto induce in the host cell with mechanisms that remain poorly understood. Werecently demonstrated that the pro-oxidant effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection areassociated with changes in the cellular metabolism and transmembrane fluxes ofCys and GSH. These appear to be the consequence of an increased use of Cys inviral protein synthesis and to ER stress pathway activation that interfere withtranscription factors, as Nrf2 and NFkB, important to coordinate the metabolismof GSH with other aspects of the stress response and with the pro-inflammatoryeffects of this virus in the host cell. This narrative review article describesthese cellular and molecular aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the role thatantivirals and cytoprotective agents such as N-acetyl cysteine may have to limit the cytopathic effects of this virus and to recover tissue homeostasis afterinfection.

TI  - The Role of Antioxidants in the Interplay between Oxidative Stress andSenescence.
LID - 1224 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/antiox11071224 [doi]
AB  - Cellular senescence is an irreversible state of cell cycle arrest occurring inresponse to stressful stimuli, such as telomere attrition, DNA damage, reactiveoxygen species, and oncogenic proteins. Although beneficial and protective inseveral physiological processes, an excessive senescent cell burden has beeninvolved in various pathological conditions including aging, tissue dysfunctionand chronic diseases. Oxidative stress (OS) can drive senescence due to a loss ofbalance between pro-oxidant stimuli and antioxidant defences. Therefore, theidentification and characterization of antioxidant compounds capable ofpreventing or counteracting the senescent phenotype is of major interest.However, despite the considerable number of studies, a comprehensive overview of the main antioxidant molecules capable of counteracting OS-induced senescence is still lacking. Here, besides a brief description of the molecular mechanismsimplicated in OS-mediated aging, we review and discuss the role of enzymes,mitochondria-targeting compounds, vitamins, carotenoids, organosulfur compounds, nitrogen non-protein molecules, minerals, flavonoids, and non-flavonoids asantioxidant compounds with an anti-aging potential, therefore offering insightsinto innovative lifespan-extending approaches.

TI  - Therapeutic Potential of a Novel Vitamin D3 Oxime Analogue, VD1-6, with CYP24A1Enzyme Inhibitory Activity and Negligible Vitamin D Receptor Binding.
LID - 960 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biom12070960 [doi]
AB  - The regulation of vitamin D3 actions in humans occurs mainly through theCytochrome P450 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) enzyme activity. CYP24A1 hydroxylatesboth 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D3) and 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol(1,25(OH)2D3), which is the first step of vitamin D catabolism. An abnormalstatus of the upregulation of CYP24A1 occurs in many diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). CYP24A1 upregulation in CKD and diminished activation ofvitamin D3 contribute to secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), progressive bonedeterioration, and soft tissue and cardiovascular calcification. Previous studieshave indicated that CYP24A1 inhibition may be an effective strategy to increaseendogenous vitamin D activity and decrease SHPT. This study has designed andsynthesized a novel C-24 O-methyloxime analogue of vitamin D3 (VD1-6) to havespecific CYP24A1 inhibitory properties. VD1-6 did not bind to the vitamin Dreceptor (VDR) in concentrations up to 10(-7) M, assessed by a VDR binding assay.The absence of VDR binding by VD1-6 was confirmed in human embryonic kidneyHEK293T cultures through the lack of CYP24A1 induction. However, in silicodocking experiments demonstrated that VD1-6 was predicted to have superiorbinding to CYP24A1, when compared to that of 1,25(OH)2D3. The inhibition ofCYP24A1 by VD1-6 was also evident by the synergistic potentiation of1,25(OH)2D3-mediated transcription and reduced 1,25(OH)2D3 catabolism over 24 h. A further indication of CYP24A1 inhibition by VD1-6 was the reduced accumulation of the 24,25(OH)D3, the first metabolite of 25(OH)D catabolism by CYP24A1. Ourfindings suggest the potent CYP24A1 inhibitory properties of VD1-6 and itspotential for testing as an alternative therapeutic candidate for treating SHPT.

AB  - Porcine liver has a high nutritional value and is rich in proteins, minerals, andvitamins, making it an interesting co-product to alleviate the growing globaldemand for protein. The objective of this study was to analyze how the drying anddefatting processes of porcine liver affect the physicochemical andtechno-functional properties of its proteins. Two drying temperatures (40 and 70 degrees C) were studied, and dried samples were defatted using organic solvents. The drying process turned out to be an effective method for the stabilization of the protein fraction; however, when the drying temperature was high (70 degreesC), greater protein degradation was found compared to drying at a moderatetemperature (40 degrees C). Regarding the defatting stage, it contributed to animprovement in certain techno-functional properties of the liver proteins, suchas the foaming capacity (the average of the dried and defatted samples was 397%higher than the dried samples), with the degree of foaming stability in the liverdried at 40 degrees C and defatted being the highest (13.76 min). Moreover, theemulsifying capacity of the different treatments was not found to varysignificantly (p &gt; 0.05). Therefore, the conditions of the drying anddefatting processes conducted prior to the extraction of liver proteins must beproperly adjusted to maximize the stability, quality, and techno-functionalproperties of the proteins.

LID - 10.1177/03000605221113800 [doi]
AB  - Low serum levels of vitamin D have been reported as a risk factor for breastcancer. This narrative review provides an update on the impact of vitamin D onhormone receptors, notably estrogen receptor subunits, and gives insights onpossible therapeutic interventions to overcome breast cancer. In addition,evidence that supports the beneficial use of vitamin D as adjuvant treatment ofbreast cancer is summarized. Vitamin D deficiency is significantly widespread in patients with triple-negative tumors. Several studies have observed a possiblemodulatory effect of vitamin D or its analogues on the expression of differenthormone receptors in breast cancer and increased sensitivity to tamoxifen.Vitamin D possesses anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects in patientswith breast cancer, and the mechanism of action of vitamin D in patients withbreast cancer is discussed. In conclusion, vitamin D appears to have a beneficialrole in the prevention and management of breast cancer, however, large-scale,randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effects of vitamin D inbreast cancer prevention or treatment.

TI  - Effect of vitamin K2 administration on depression status in patients withpolycystic ovary syndrome: a randomized clinical trial.
PG  - 315
LID - 10.1186/s12905-022-01825-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are predisposed to thedevelopment of several mental comorbidities such as depression. According toseveral studies, PCOS can be managed by improving insulin sensitivity. Theinsulin-sensitizing effect of vitamin K has been reported in recent studies.Therefore, in the current trial, we assessed the effect of administrating vitaminK2 (Menaquinone-7) on depression status in women afflicted with PCOS. METHODS:Eighty-four PCOS women were allocated into the intervention and comparisongroups; the intervention group (n = 42) administered 90 microg/day Menaquinone-7,and the comparison group (n = 42) consumed placebo capsules (containing avesil)for 8 weeks. In this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial,depression status was measured by BECK depression inventory-II (BDI-II) beforeand after 8 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: Consumption of Menaquinone-7 incomparison with the placebo capsules significantly improved depression status (P = 0.012). CONCLUSION: This clinical study reported the advantageous effect ofMenaquinone-7 administration on depression status in PCOS patients.

TI  - Higher glutamatergic activity in the medial prefrontal cortex in chronic ketamineusers.
PG  - E263-E271
LID - 10.1503/jpn.210179 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role indepression and addiction. Previous studies have shown alterations inglutamatergic activity in the mPFC following the administration of ketamine inpatients with depression and healthy controls. However, it remains unclearwhether chronic, nonmedical use of ketamine affects metabolites in the mPFC.METHODS: Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we measured metabolites(glutamate and glutamine [Glx]; phosphocreatine and creatine [PCr+Cr];myo-inositol; N-acetyl-aspartate; and glycerophosphocholine and phosphocholine[GPC+PC]) in the mPFC of chronic ketamine users (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 43). Among ketamine users, 60% consumed ketamine once per day or more, 10%consumed it every 2 days and 30% consumed it every 3 or more days. Using analysisof covariance, we evaluated between-group differences in the ratios ofGlx:PCr+Cr, myo-inositol:PCr+Cr, N-acetyl-aspartate:PCr+Cr and GPC+PC:PCr+Cr.RESULTS: Chronic ketamine users showed significantly higher Glx:PCr+Cr ratiosthan healthy controls (median 1.05 v. 0.95, p = 0.008). We found no significantdifferences in myoinositol:PCr+Cr, N-acetyl-aspartate:PCr+Cr or GPC+PC:PCr+Crratios between the 2 groups. We found a positive relationship betweenN-acetyl-aspartate:PCr+Cr and Glx:PCr+Cr ratios in the healthy control group (R =0.345, p = 0.023), but the ketamine use group failed to show such an association (rho = 0.197, p = 0.40). LIMITATIONS: The cross-sectional design of this studydid not permit causal inferences related to higher Glx:PCr+Cr ratios and chronic ketamine use. CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence that chronicketamine users have higher glutamatergic activity in the mPFC than healthycontrols; this finding may provide new insights relevant to the treatment ofdepression with ketamine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or Hashimoto's thyroiditis is themost frequent cause of acquired hypothyroidism in children. An associationbetween low levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH vitamin D) and the development ofthe disease have been detected. The aim of this study was to describe 25OHvitamin D levels in patients aged 5 to 18 years with a diagnosis of Hashimoto'sthyroiditis in three pediatric endocrinology outpatient centers in Medellin,Colombia. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational study withretrospective data collection. We evaluated the sociodemographic characteristics,diagnoses, presence of comorbidities, and frequency of vitamin D deficiency.RESULTS: Sixty patients were included. The 25OH vitamin D levels were sufficient in 65% of the cases according to the Institute of Medicine (IOM) criteria and in 10% of the cases according to the Endocrine Society criteria. Serum calcium andphosphorus values were normal in 53% and 45% of the patients, respectively. Allpatients had normal magnesium and parathyroid hormone levels. No differences werefound in the exploratory analysis when comparing 25OH vitamin D levels, thyroidantibody levels, and thyroid volume. CONCLUSIONS: In this chronic lymphocyticthyroiditis population, we did not find an increased prevalence of vitamin Ddeficiency according to IOM or the Endocrine Society criteria compared withprevious data from the general population. No statistically significantdifferences were found in the exploratory analysis.

TI  - Metabolomics-Guided Comparison of Pollen and Microalgae-Based Artificial Diets inHoney Bees.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02583 [doi]
AB  - Managed honey bee colonies used for crop pollination are fed artificial diets to offset nutritional deficiencies related to land-use intensification and climatechange. In this study, we formulated novel microalgae diets using Chlorellavulgaris and Arthrospira platensis (spirulina) biomass and fed them to youngadult honey bee workers. Diet-induced changes in bee metabolite profiles werestudied relative to a natural pollen diet using liquid chromatography-massspectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)metabolomics. Untargeted analyses of pollen- and microalgae-fed bees revealedsignificant overlap, with 248 shared features determined by LC-MS and 87 sharedfeatures determined by GC-MS. Further metabolomic commonalities were evident uponsubtraction of unique diet features. Twenty-five identified metabolites wereinfluenced by diet, which included complex lipids, essential fatty acids,vitamins, and phytochemicals. The metabolomics results are useful to understandmechanisms underlying favorable growth performance as well as increasedantioxidant and heat shock protein gene expression in bees fed the microalgaediets. We conclude that the tested microalgae have potential as sustainable feed additives and as a source of bee health-modulating natural products.Metabolomics-guided diet development could eventually help tailor feedinterventions to achieve precision nutrition in honey bees and other livestockanimals.

TI  - Chromosome-scale genome assembly of the hexaploid Taiwanese goosefoot 'djulis'(Chenopodium formosanum).
LID - evac120 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/gbe/evac120 [doi]
AB  - Djulis (Chenopodium formosanum Koidz.) is a crop grown since antiquity in Taiwan.It is a BCD-genome hexaploid (2n = 6x = 54) domesticated form of lambsquarters(C. album L.) and a relative of the allotetraploid (AABB) C. quinoa. As withquinoa, djulis seed contains a complete protein profile and many nutritionallyimportant vitamins and minerals. While still sold locally in Taiwanese markets,its traditional culinary uses are being lost as diets of younger generationschange. Moreover, indigenous Taiwanese peoples who have long safeguarded djulisare losing their traditional farmlands. We used PacBio sequencing and Hi-C-based scaffolding to produce a chromosome-scale, reference-quality assembly of djulis. The final genome assembly spans 1.63 Gb in 798 scaffolds, with 97.8% of thesequence contained in 27 scaffolds representing the nine haploid chromosomes ofeach sub-genome of the species. BUSCO results indicated that 98.5% of theconserved orthologous genes for Viridiplantae are complete within the assembledgenome, with 92.9% duplicated, as expected for a polyploid. A total of 67.8% ofthe assembly is repetitive, with the most common repeat being Gypsy long terminalrepeat retrotransposons, which had significantly expanded in the B sub-genome.Gene annotation using Iso-Seq data from multiple tissues identified 75,056putative gene models. Comparisons to quinoa showed strong patterns of syntenywhich allowed for the identification of homoeologous chromosomes, andsub-genome-specific sequences were used to assign homoeologs to each sub-genome. These results represent the first hexaploid genome assembly and the firstassemblies of the C and D genomes of the Chenopodioideae subfamily.

TI  - Machine learning and murine models explain failures of clinical sepsis trials.
PG  - 187-194
LID - 10.1097/TA.0000000000003691 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple clinical trials failed to demonstrate the efficacy ofhydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine (HAT) in sepsis. These trials weredominated by patients with pulmonary sepsis and have not accounted fordifferences in the inflammatory responses across varying etiologies ofinjury/illness. Hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine have previouslyrevealed tremendous benefits in animal peritonitis sepsis models (cecal ligation and puncture [CLP]) in contradiction to the various clinical trials. The impactof HAT remains unclear in pulmonary sepsis. Our objective was to investigate the impact of HAT in pneumonia, consistent with the predominate etiology in thediscordant clinical trials. We hypothesized that, in a pulmonary sepsis model,HAT would act synergistically to reduce end-organ dysfunction by the altering theinflammatory response, in a unique manner compared with CLP. METHODS: UsingPseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, a pulmonary sepsis model (pneumonia [PNA]) was compared directly to previously investigated intra-abdominal sepsis models.Machine learning applied to early vital signs stratified animals into thosepredicted to die (pDie) versus predicted to live (pLive). Animals were thenrandomized to receive antibiotics and fluids (vehicle [VEH]) vs. HAT). Vitals,cytokines, vitamin C, and markers of liver and kidney function were assessed inthe blood, bronchoalveolar lavage, and organ homogenates. RESULTS: PNA wasinduced in 119 outbred wild-type Institute of Cancer Research mice (predictedmortality approximately 50%) similar to CLP. In PNA, interleukin 1 receptorantagonist in 72-hour bronchoalveolar lavage was lower with HAT (2.36 ng/mL)compared with VEH (4.88 ng/mL; p = 0.04). The remaining inflammatory cytokinesand markers of liver/renal function showed no significant difference with HAT in PNA. PNA vitamin C levels were 0.62 mg/dL (pDie HAT), lower than vitamin C levelsafter CLP (1.195 mg/dL). Unlike CLP, PNA mice did not develop acute kidney injury(blood urea nitrogen: pDie, 33.5 mg/dL vs. pLive, 27.6 mg/dL; p = 0.17).Furthermore, following PNA, HAT did not significantly reduce microscopic renaloxidative stress (mean gray area: pDie, 16.64 vs. pLive, 6.88; p = 0.93). Unlike CLP where HAT demonstrated a survival benefit, HAT had no impact on survival inPNA. CONCLUSION: Hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine therapy has minimal benefits in pneumonia. The inflammatory response induced by pulmonary sepsis isunique compared with the response during intra-abdominal sepsis. Consequently,different etiologies of sepsis respond differently to HAT therapy.

TI  - Is there any association between undesired children and health status ofunder-five children? Analysis of a nationally representative sample fromBangladesh.
PG  - 445
LID - 10.1186/s12887-022-03489-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Child health, especially childhood mortality, is one of the critical indicators of human development. No child mortality is desirable, but it is stillhigh in Bangladesh. We aimed to assess the effect of the child's desired statuson childhood morbidity and mortality in Bangladesh. METHODS: We used the datafrom the nationally representative cross-sectional Bangladesh Demographic andHealth Survey (BDHS) 2017-18 and restricted the analyses to children born in the past five years preceding the survey. We estimated the undesired status (excessin boy, girl, both, and parity) by subtracting an ideal number of children fromthe total live birth. We measured childhood mortality (perinatal, early neonatal,neonatal, post-neonatal, infant, child, and under-five mortality), morbidity(fever, diarrhea, cough, and acute respiratory infectious-ARI), nutritionalproblems (stunting, wasting, underweight, and low birth weight), and treatments(postnatal care, treatment for fever, diarrhea/cough, and vitamin Asupplementation). Finally, we utilized the chi-square test and multilevelmixed-effects logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of undesired children was 19.2%, 21.5%, 3.7%, and 25.4% for boys, girls, both boys and girls, and parity, respectively. Age, education, residence, division, and wealth indexwere significantly associated with undesired children. The prevalence ofunder-five mortality was 3.3% among desired children, almost double (5.4%) among undesired children. The likelihood of under-five mortality was [adjusted oddsratio (aOR): 2.05, p </= 0.001] higher among undesired children. Despite lowerunder-five mortality among higher socioeconomic status, the relative contributionof undesired children to under-fiver mortality was substantial. The undesiredgirl children were associated with an increased likelihood of moderately wasting (aOR: 1.28, p = 0.072), severely underweight (aOR: 1.41, p = 0.066), and lowbirth weight (aOR: 1.50, p </= 0.05). Moreover, the undesired children were 19%(p </= 0.05) more likely to be infected with fever. The undesired children hadlower treatment for diarrhea and fever/cough and were less likely to get vitamin A supplementation (aOR: 0.71, p </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The share of childhoodmorbidity, mortality, and malnutrition were higher among undesired children.Every child should be wanted, and no unwanted pregnancies are desirable; thereby,the government should reemphasize the proper use of family planning methods toreduce child mortality and malnutrition.

TI  - Characterization of methylation patterns associated with lifestyle factors andvitamin D supplementation in a healthy elderly cohort from Southwest Sweden.
PG  - 12670

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that lifestyle factors, such as regular physicalactivity and vitamin D intake, may remarkably improve overall health and mentalwellbeing. This is especially important in older adults whose vitamin Ddeficiency occurs with a high prevalence. This study aimed to examine theinfluence of lifestyle and vitamin D on global DNA methylation patterns in anelderly cohort in Southwest of Sweden. We also sought to examine the methylation levels of specific genes involved in vitamin D's molecular and metabolicactivated pathways. We performed a genome wide methylation analysis, usingIllumina Infinium DNA Methylation EPIC 850kBeadChip array, on 277 healthyindividuals from Southwest Sweden at the age of 70-95. The study participantsalso answered queries on lifestyle, vitamin intake, heart medication, andestimated health. Vitamin D intake did not in general affect methylationpatterns, which is in concert with other studies. However, when comparing thegroup of individuals taking vitamin supplements, including vitamin D, with those not taking supplements, a difference in methylation in the solute carrier family 25 (SCL25A24) gene was found. This confirms a previous finding, where changes in expression of SLC25A24 were associated with vitamin D treatment in humanmonocytes. The combination of vitamin D intake and high physical activityincreased methylation of genes linked to regulation of vitamin D receptorpathway, the Wnt pathway and general cancer processes. To our knowledge, this is the first study detecting epigenetic markers associated with the combined effectsof vitamin D supplementation and high physical activity. These results deserve tobe further investigated in an extended, interventional study cohort, where alsothe levels of 25(OH)D3 can be monitored.

AB  - Mushrooms are a group of fungi with great diversity and ultra-acceleratedmetabolism. As a consequence, mushrooms have developed a protective mechanismconsisting of high concentrations of antioxidants such as selenium, polyphenols, beta-glucans, ergothioneine, various vitamins and other bioactive metabolites.The mushrooms of the Pleurotus genus have generated scientific interest due totheir therapeutic properties, especially related to risk factors connected to theseverity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this report, we highlight thetherapeutic properties of Pleurotus mushrooms that may be associated with areduction in the severity of COVID-19: antihypertensive, antihyperlipidemic,antiatherogenic, anticholesterolemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory andantihyperglycemic properties. These properties may interact significantly withrisk factors for COVID-19 severity, and the therapeutic potential of thesemushrooms for the treatment or prevention of this disease is evident. Besidesthis, studies show that regular consumption of Pleurotus species mushrooms orcomponents isolated from their tissues is beneficial for immune health. Pleurotusspecies mushrooms may have a role in the prevention or treatment of infectiousdiseases either as food supplements or as sources for pharmacological agents.

TI  - Meta-analysis of apparent ruminal synthesis and postruminal flow of B vitamins indairy cows.
LID - S0022-0302(22)00414-3 [pii]
LID - 10.3168/jds.2021-21656 [doi]
AB  - As milk production has significantly increased over the past decade(s), existing estimates of the B-vitamin needs of the modern dairy cow are currently beingreconsidered, as suboptimal B-vitamin supply may affect metabolic efficiency. At the same time, however, "true" (i.e., biologically active forms, excludingnonfunctional analogs) B-vitamin supply also cannot be adequately estimated bydietary intake, as the rumen microbiota has been shown to play a significant rolein synthesis and utilization of B vitamins. Given their complex impact on themetabolism of dairy cows, incorporating these key nutrients into the nextgeneration of mathematical models could help to better predict animal production and performance. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to generate hypotheses of regulation in the absence of supplemental B vitamins by creating empiricalmodels, through a meta-analysis, to describe true B-vitamin supply to the cow(postruminal flow, PRF) and apparent ruminal synthesis (ARS). The database usedfor this meta-analysis consisted of 340 individual cow observations from 15studies with 16 experiments, where diet and postruminal digesta samples were(post hoc) analyzed for content of B vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B6, B9, B12).Equations of univariate and multivariate linear form were considered. Modelsdescribing ARS considered dry matter intake (DMI, kg/d), B-vitamin dietaryconcentration [mg/kg of dry matter (DM)] and rumen-level variables such as rumen digestible neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and starch (g/kg of DM), total volatile fatty acids (VFA, mM), acetate, propionate, butyrate, and valerate molarproportions (% of VFA), mean pH, and fractional rates of degradation of NDF andstarch (%/h). Models describing PRF considered dietary-level driving variablessuch as DMI, B-vitamin dietary concentration (mg/kg of DM), starch and crudeprotein (g/kg of DM) and forage NDF (g/kg of DM). Equations developed wererequired to contain all significant slope parameters and contained no significantcollinearity between driving variables. Concordance correlation coefficient wasused to evaluate the models on the developmental data set due to data scarcity.Overall, modeling ARS yielded better-performing models compared with modelingPRF, and DMI was included in all prediction equations as a scalar variable. TheB-vitamin dietary concentration had a negative effect on the ARS of B1, B2, B3,and B6 but increased the PRF of B2 and B9. The rumen digestible NDF concentrationhad a negative effect on the ARS of B2, B3, and B6, whereas rumen digestiblestarch concentration had a negative effect on the ARS of B1 and a positive effecton the ARS of B9. In the best prediction models, the dietary starch increased PRFof B1, B2, and B9 but decreased PRF of B12. The equations developed may be usedto better understand the effect of diet and ruminal environment on the truesupply of B vitamins to the dairy cow and stimulate the development ofbetter-defined requirements in the future.

AB  - Carotenoids are a large class of important lipid-soluble phytonutrients that are widely used as nutritional supplements due to their health-promoting activities. For example, beta-carotene is the precursor for vitamin A synthesis, andastaxanthin is a powerful antioxidant. However, these carotenoids cannot besynthesized de novo by humans. These properties of beta-carotene and astaxanthin make them attractive targets for metabolic engineering in rice (Oryza sativa)endosperm because rice is an important staple food in developing countries, andrice endosperm is devoid of carotenoids. In this chapter, we introduce an assaybased on rice embryogenic callus for the rapid functional characterization ofgenes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis and accumulation. The system is also anideal platform to characterize cereal endosperm specific promoters. Four diverse cereal endosperm specific promoters were demonstrated to be active in rice callusdespite their restricted activity in mature plants. The use of endosperm specificpromoters that are expressed in rice callus, but remain silent in regeneratedvegetative tissue, directs accumulation of carotenoids in the endosperm withoutinterfering with plant growth. Rice callus is a useful platform for improvinggene editing methods and for further optimizing pathway engineering. Thus, therice callus platform provides a unique opportunity to test strategies formetabolic engineering of synthetic carotenoid pathways, leading to novelcarotenoid-biofortified crops.

AB  - Golden Rice is a genetically modified rice variety that accumulates carotenoidswith provitamin A activity in its endosperm. This biofortified crop was developedto fight provitamin A deficiency prevailing in countries with a diet based onrice as the major staple. Since its first version in 2000, Golden Rice wascontinuously developed to increase endosperm carotenoids, to achieve regulatorycompliance, and to introgress the trait into regional rice varieties. Golden Ricewas recently approved for planting in the Philippines. In this review, werecapitulate major steps leading to the current version of Golden Rice. Weexamine the knowledge regarding the carotenoid pathway and the technicalcapabilities to generate transgenic plants at each development stage. Moreover,we discuss whether the scientific approaches taken at the time would be anydifferent today with the increased knowledge and analytical capacities available.We conclude that most decisions for each Golden Rice version would be verysimilar which is due to the peculiarities and the complexity of the carotenoidbiosynthetic pathway. However, each step taken in the development of Golden Rice yielded much insight about regulation of the carotenoid pathway in plants as wellas into specific requirements in rice endosperm. The knowledge gained and therecent advances in the field can provide strategies and molecular tools,including synthetic biology approaches, to help develop future versions of GoldenRice with improved provitamin A levels and carotenoid storage capabilities of therice endosperm.

TI  - Vitamin D Supplementation for Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo: A Systematic Review.
PG  - e704-e711
LID - 10.1097/MAO.0000000000003586 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) is commonly attributed to displaced otoconia. These have been shown to have biomineralization close to thatof bone, and vitamin D deficiency has been associated with BPPV. We aim tosystematically review the available literature on vitamin D supplementation andBPPV intensity and recurrence in adults. DATABASES REVIEWED: PubMed, MEDLINE,EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CurrentControlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. METHODS: We systematically reviewedthe available literature from 1947 to April 2020. The study protocol wasregistered in the PROSPERO database (trial registration: CRD42020183195).RESULTS: A total of 179 abstracts were identified and screened by two independentreviewers. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, six studies were selectedand subjected to a quality assessment. In one randomized clinical trial (RCT),vitamin D supplementation was found to reduce annual recurrence rate of vertigoin patient with BPPV and subnormal serum vitamin D levels compared with placebo(odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.54-0.90). Non-RCTs demonstrated thepossibility of a null effect in the random effects model (odds ratio, 0.08; 95%confidence interval, 0.00-1.56). The RCT considered as low risk of bias. All ofthe nonrandomized studies were assessed as serious risk of bias. CONCLUSIONS: Theintervention studies identified consistently demonstrated a decrease in BPPVrecurrence with supplementation of vitamin D in patients with subnormal vitamin Dlevels. Although there is a paucity of high-quality studies, the presentliterature does highlight a role for optimization of vitamin D levels in patientswith BPPV.

AB  - Microalgae are well-known for their content of bioactive molecules such aspigments, proteins, fatty acids, polysaccharides, vitamins and antioxidants, all of which are of great interest in the preparation of a wide range of productssuch as food, cosmetics and nutraceuticals. The purpose of this project was theanalytical characterization of commercial dry microalgal biomass: four samples ofChlorella and five of Spirulina were analysed in order to highlight their contentin terms of micro/macro nutrients. The research was oriented towards thedevelopment and validation of accurate, fast and reproducible methods for thenutritional assessment of algal biomasses, aiming to provide a guidingmethodology. The lipid profiles of algal matrixes were analysed for the contentof saturated, unsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids. The process wasdivided into two phases: firstly, the extraction and determination of the totallipids and pigment content; secondly, the trans-esterification of the extractedlipid-pigment portion in order to analyse fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with aGC-MS method. A fingerprinting of MUFAs and PUFAs was obtained regardingmicroalgae species. The determination of total carotenoids and chlorophyllscontent in the lipid extracts was evaluated through a fast UV-Visspectrophotometric analysis, which was validated by a new HPLC-DAD analysis.Furthermore, the total antioxidant activity of each lipid extract was determined along with the determination of the microalgae protein content. Then, with theaid of the principal component analysis (PCA) plots, the two microalgae wereclustered in terms of their micro/macro nutrients, for differentiating theirproperties. Spirulina, resulting to have a greater antioxidant activity,supposedly due to a higher content in pigments and higher protein concentration, could be suggested for an appropriate diet for sporting people. Chlorella,instead, showed a more balanced profile of PUFAs and MUFAs and its use could besuggested for cosmetics and vegan diets. This paper puts forward an overallanalytical approach, sustained by a multivariate analysis, for emphasisingcontent differences and activity of two different microalgae strains, in order tounderline specific claims for each class, addressed to defined final users.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence demonstrated that vitamin D insufficiency was involved ininsulin resistance (IR) pathogenesis and associated with tuberculosis. However,the association of vitamin D and IR in patients with latent tuberculosisinfection (LTBI) remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the associationbetween vitamin D and insulin resistance in US adults with LTBI. METHOD: NationalHealth and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants >/= 20 years duringthe years 2011-2012 with positive QuantiFERON(R)-TB Gold-In-Tube (QFT) ortuberculin skin testing (TST) were enrolled in present study. Participants withLTBI were divided into 2 groups: (1) vitamin D insufficiency group (n = 267), and(2) vitamin D sufficiency group (n = 437). RESULTS: Weighted analysis of all the population in the study showed that serum 25(OH)D inversely correlated withHOMA-IR (r = -0.14, P = 0.008). The vitamin D insufficiency group had higherfasting insulin (17.5 (1.38) vs. 15.29 (3.1), respectively, P = 0.0013) andHOMA-IR (5.0 (0.4) vs. 4.5 (1), respectively, P = 0.013) than the vitamin Dsufficiency group. In adjusted analysis, vitamin D levels was independentlyassociated with insulin resistance (adjusted OR [aOR] 2.74; 95% CI, 1.01-7.48, p = 0.0489). CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study suggested that serum 25(OH) Dconcentrations were inversely and independently associated with HOMA-IR in LTBI.

AB  - Alginate-based nanocarriers are propitious vehicles used for the delivery ofbioactive compounds (bioactives). In this area, calcium alginate and sodiumalginate are the most promising wall materials because they are nontoxic,comparatively cheap, simple in production, biocompatible and biodegradable. Inthis review, we have highlighted different alginate-based nanocarriers such asnanoparticles, nanofibers, nanoemulsions, nanocomplexes, and nanohydrogels; also entrapment of different bioactives within alginate nanocarriers and theirbioavailability in the gastric environment has been comprehensively discussed.Being biopolymers, alginates can be exploited as emulsifiers/ encapsulants forentrapment and delivery of different bioactives such as vitamins, minerals,essential fatty acids, peptides, essential oils, bioactive oils, polyphenols and carotenoids. Furthermore, the use of alginate-based nanocarriers in combinationwith other polysaccharides/ emulsifiers was recognized as the most effective and favorable approach for the protection, delivery and sustained release ofbioactives.

TI  - Development and Applications of a Zebrafish (Danio rerio) CYP1A-TargetedMonoclonal Antibody (CRC4) with Reactivity across Vertebrate Taxa: Evidence for aConserved CYP1A Epitope.
LID - 404 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/toxics10070404 [doi]
AB  - CYP1A is a heme-thiolate enzyme associated with the cytochrome P4501A1monooxygenase system and is inducible by a wide variety of xenobiotics andendogenous ligands that bind and activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR).The AHR-CYP1A axis is important for detoxification of certain xenobiotics and forhomeostatic balance of endogenous sex hormones, amine hormones, vitamins, fattyacids, and phospholipids. Herein, we generated and described applications of azebrafish CYP1A-targeted monoclonal antibody (mAb CRC4) that fortuitouslyrecognizes induced CYP1A across vertebrate taxa, including fish, chicken, mouse, rat, and human. We then demonstrated that mAb CRC4 targets a highly conservedepitope signature of vertebrate CYP1A. The unique complimentary determiningregion (CDR) sequences of heavy and light chains were determined, and these Igsequences will allow for the expression of recombinant mAb CRC4, thus supersedingthe need for long-term hybridoma maintenance. This antibody works well forimmunohistochemistry (IHC), as well as whole-mounted IHC in zebrafish embryos.Monoclonal antibody CRC4 may be particularly useful for studying the AHR-CYP1Aaxis in multiple vertebrate species and within the context of Oceans and HumanHealth research. By using archived samples, when possible, we actively promotedefforts to reduce, replace, and refine studies involving live animals.

TI  - beta-Carotene from the Alga Dunaliella bardawil Decreases Gene Expression ofAdipose Tissue Macrophage Recruitment Markers and Plasma Lipid Concentrations in Mice Fed a High-Fat Diet.
LID - 433 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20070433 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids are involved in the regulation of adipose tissue metabolism and inflammation. We examined the effect of dietarysupplementation using all-trans and 9-cis beta-carotene-rich Dunaliella bardawil alga as the sole source of vitamin A on obesity-associated comorbidities andadipose tissue dysfunction in a diet-induced obesity mouse model. Three-week-old male mice (C57BL/6) were randomly allocated into two groups and fed a high-fat,vitamin A-deficient diet supplemented with either vitamin A (HFD) orbeta-carotene (BC) (HFD-BC). Vitamin A levels in the liver, WATs, and BAT of the HFD-BC group were 1.5-2.4-fold higher than of the HFD group. BC concentrationswere 5-6-fold greater in BAT compared to WAT in the HFD-BC group. The eWAT mRNAlevels of the Mcp-1 and Cd68 were 1.6- and 2.1-fold lower, respectively, and the plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were 30% and 28% lower in the HFD-BC group compared with the HFD group. Dietary BC can be the exclusive vitaminA source in mice fed a high-fat diet, as shown by the vitamin A concentration in the plasma and tissues. Feeding BC rather than vitamin A reduces adipose tissuemacrophage recruitment markers and plasma lipid concentrations.

TI  - Production of Carotenoids and Phospholipids by Thraustochytrium sp. in Batch and Repeated-Batch Culture.
LID - 416 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/md20070416 [doi]
AB  - The carotenogenic thraustochytrid Thraustochytrium sp. RT2316-16 was grown inbatch and repeated-batch cultures using different feeds containing glucose, orglycerol, and yeast extract, for the production of lipids, phospholipids andcarotenoids. RT2316-16 produced canthaxanthin, astaxanthin and beta-carotene. Theeffects of biotin, ascorbic acid, light and temperature were evaluated in some ofthe experiments. In 2-day-old batch cultures, the combined mass percentage ofeicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in total lipids was between 16.5% (glycerol-based medium in the dark; biomass concentration = 4.2 +/- 1.1 g L(-1)) and 42.6% (glucose-based medium under light; biomass concentration = 3.3 +/- 0.1 g L(-1)), decreasing to 3.8% and 6.1%, respectively, after day 4. Inrepeated-batch cultures, the total lipids in the biomass increased after glucose or glycerol was fed alone, whereas the total carotenoids (168 +/- 7 mug g(-1) dryweight (DW)) and phospholipids in the biomass increased after feeding with yeast extract. The biomass with the highest content of phospholipids (28.7 +/- 4.3 mgg(-1) DW) was obtained using a feed medium formulated with glycerol, yeastextract and ascorbic acid. Glycerol was the best carbon source for the productionof a biomass enriched with total lipids (467 +/- 45 mg g(-1) DW). The compositionof carotenoids depended strongly on the composition of the feed. Repeated-batchcultures fed with yeast extract contained canthaxanthin as the main carotenoid,whereas in the cultures fed only with glucose, the biomass contained mainlybeta-carotene.

TI  - Mineral Content Variation in Leaves, Stalks, and Seeds of Celery (Apiumgraveolens L.) Genotypes.
LID - 10.1007/s12011-022-03359-4 [doi]
AB  - Celery is an important nutritionally rich crop in the family Apiaceae. It iscultivated worldwide for food as well as for use in pharmaceutics. It is anexcellent source of minerals, vitamins, and phytochemicals. Identification ofsuperior genotypes with improved nutritional content is the requirement todevelop cultivars for commercial cultivation. For mineral analysis of celery, an experiment was carried out taking 20 diverse genotypes. These genotypes wereanalysed for macro- and micronutrients which include nitrogen (N), phosphorus(P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper(Cu), and sodium (Na). The study revealed high content of K (20.3-26.1 mg/g dryweight (DW)) and Zn (0.09-0.14 mg/g DW) in leaves while the stalks were rich inCa (41.5-51.3 mg/g DW) and Na (5.2-8.0 mg/g DW). High contents of P (5.2-6.8 mg/gDW), Fe (0.41-0.56 mg/g DW), Cu (0.015-0.026 mg/g DW), and Mn (0.020-0.029 mg/gDW) were observed in seeds. Based on the mineral content, three genotypes, viz., PAU2, PAU4, and PAU7, were found to be superior in terms of mineral compositionin leaves, stalks, and seeds. Cluster analysis divided the genotypes into twomajor groups. These genotypes can be used in crosses as they showed greatpotential for use in biofortification. This study opens newer avenues for future research, encouraging researchers to enhance the product quality and productionefficiency of the leaves, stalks, and seeds valuable for human consumption.

TI  - Vitamin B12 and/or folic acid supplementation on linear growth; a 6 yearsfollow-up study of a randomised controlled trial in early childhood in NorthIndia.

AB  - Folate and vitamin B12 are essential for growth. Our objective was to estimatetheir long-term effects on linear growth in North Indian children. This is afollow-up study of a factorial designed, double-blind, randomizedplacebo-controlled trial in 1,000 young children. Starting at 6-30 months of age,we gave folic acid ( approximately 2 RDAs), vitamin B12 ( approximately 2 RDAs), both vitamins, or a placebo daily for six months. Six years after the end ofsupplementation, we measured height in 791 children. We used the plasmaconcentrations of cobalamin, folate, and total homocysteine to estimate vitaminstatus. The effect of the interventions, the association between height-for-agez-scores (HAZ) and baseline vitamin status, and the interactions betweensupplementation and baseline status were estimated in multiple regression models.Mean (SD) age at follow-up was 7.4 (0.7) years (range 6 to 9 years). There was a small, non-significant effect of vitamin B12 on linear growth and no effect offolic acid. We observed a subgroup-effect of vitamin B12 supplementation in thosewith plasma cobalamin concentration < 200 pmol/L (P interaction = 0.01). Theeffect of vitamin B12 supplementation in this group was 0.34 HAZ (95% CI:0.11-0.58). We found an association between cobalamin status and HAZ in children not given vitamin B12 (P interaction = 0.001). In this group, each doubling ofthe cobalamin concentration was associated with 0.26 (95% CI: 0.15 to 0.38)higher HAZ. Suboptimal B12 status in early childhood seemingly limits lineargrowth in North Indian Children.

TI  - Predicted Adsorption Affinity for Enteric Microbial Metabolites to Metal andCarbon Nanomaterials.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jcim.2c00492 [doi]
AB  - Ingested nanomaterials are exposed to many metabolites that are produced,modified, or regulated by members of the enteric microbiota. The adsorption ofthese metabolites potentially affects the identity, fate, and biodistribution of nanomaterials passing the gastrointestinal tract. Here, we explore theseinteractions using in silico methods, focusing on a concise overview of 170unique enteric microbial metabolites which we compiled from the literature.First, we construct quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models topredict their adsorption affinity to 13 metal nanomaterials, 5 carbon nanotubes, and 1 fullerene. The models could be applied to predict log k values for 60metabolites and were particularly applicable to 'phenolic, benzoyl and phenylderivatives', 'tryptophan precursors and metabolites', 'short-chain fatty acids',and 'choline metabolites'. The correlations of these predictions to biologicalsurface adsorption index descriptors indicated that hydrophobicity-driveninteractions contribute most to the overall adsorption affinity, whilehydrogen-bond interactions and polarity/polarizability-driven interactionsdifferentiate the affinity to metal and carbon nanomaterials. Next, we usemolecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain direct molecular information for a selection of vitamins that could not be assessed quantitatively using QSARmodels. This showed how large and flexible metabolites can gain stability on the nanomaterial surface via conformational changes. Additionally, unconstrained MDsimulations provided excellent support for the main interaction types identified by QSAR analysis. Combined, these results enable assessing the adsorptionaffinity for many enteric microbial metabolites quantitatively and support thequalitative assessment of an even larger set of complex and biologically relevantmicrobial metabolites to carbon and metal nanomaterials.

TI  - Seven-month wintertime supplementation of 1200 IU vitamin D has no effect on handgrip strength in young, physically active males: A randomized, controlled study.
PG  - 437-454
LID - 10.1080/15502783.2022.2100718 [doi]
AB  - Background: There has been a growing interest in the role of vitamin D for thewell-being and physical performance of humans under heavy training such asconscripts in military service; however, there is a lack of long-termsupplementation studies performed on members of this type of young, physicallyactive, male population. The hypothesis of the study was that vitamin Dsupplementation during wintertime will decrease the prevalence of critically low vitamin D blood serum levels and increase hand grip strength during the winterseason among young male conscripts. Study Design: Longitudinal, triple-blinded,randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Methods: Fifty-three male conscripts fromthe Estonian Army were randomized into two groups: 27 to an intervention groupand 26 to a placebo group. The groups were comparable in terms of theirdemographics. The intervention group received 1200 IU (30 microg) capsules ofvitamin D3, and the control group received placebo oil capsules once per day. Thelength of the follow-up was 7 months, from October 2016 until April 2017. Bloodserum vitamin D (25(OH)D), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium (Ca), ionizedcalcium (Ca-i), testosterone and cortisol values, and hand grip strength weremeasured four times during the study period. Results: The mean 25(OH)D leveldecreased significantly in the control group to a critically low level during thestudy, with the lowest mean value of 22 nmol/l found in March 2017. At that time point, 65% in the control group vs 15% in the intervention group had 25(OH)Dvalues of less than 25 nmol/l (p < 0.001). In the intervention group, the levels of 25(OH)D did not change significantly during the study period. All other blood tests revealed no significant differences at any time point. The correspondingresult was found for hand grip strength at all time points. Conclusion: Long-termvitamin D supplementation during wintertime results in fewer conscripts in theEstonian Army with critically low serum vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels during thewinter season. However, this did not influence their physical performance in the form of the hand grip strength test.

TI  - Socializing Models During Lactation Alter Colonic Mucosal Gene Expression andFecal Microbiota of Growing Piglets.
PG  - 819011
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.819011 [doi]
AB  - The enrichment of the social environment during lactation alleviates the stressof weaned piglets. It is significant to understand how the enriched socialenvironment improves the weaning stress of piglets. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) ofcolonic mucosa, 16S rRNA sequencing of feces, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)of colonic content were used to determine the effects of social contact duringlactation. In this study, thirty litter lactating piglets were divided intointermittent social contact (ISC) group that contacted with neighborsintermittently, continuous social contact (CSC) group that contacted withneighbors starting at day (D) 14 after birth, and control (CON) group in whichpiglets were kept in their original litter. The piglets were weaned at D35 andregrouped at D36. The colonic mucosal RNA-seq, fecal microbes, and SCFAs ofcolonic contents of 63-day-old piglets were analyzed. The results of RNA-seqshowed that compared with the CON group, the pathways of digestion and absorptionof minerals, protein, and vitamins of piglets were changed in the ISC group,whereas the pathways of retinol metabolism and nitrogen metabolism in the colonicmucosal were affected and stimulated the immune response in the CSC group.Compared with the CON group, the abundances of pernicious microorganisms(Desulfovibrio, Pseudomonas, Brevundimonas, etc.) in the CSC group and perniciousmicroorganisms (Desulfovibrio, Neisseria, Sutterella, etc.) and beneficialbacteria (Bifidobacterium, Megamonas, and Prevotella_9) in the ISC group weresignificantly higher (p < 0.05). The abundances of proinflammatory bacteria(Coriobacteriaceae_unclassified, Coprococcus_3, and Ruminococcus_2) in the CSCgroup were significantly increased (p < 0.05), but the abundances of SCFAsproducing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae_UCG-010, Parabacteroides, Anaerotruncus,etc.) and those of anti-inflammatory bacteria (Eubacterium, Parabacteroides,Ruminiclostridium_9, and Alloprevotella) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) inthe CSC group. Compared with the CON group, the concentrations of microbialmetabolites, acetate, and propionate in the colonic contents were reduced (p <0.05) in the ISC group, whereas the concentration of acetate was reduced (p <0.05) in the CSC group. Therefore, both ISC and CSC during lactation affected thecomposition of fecal microbes and changed the expression of intestinal mucosalgenes related to nutrient metabolism and absorption of piglets.

WSP contains 19.87%carbohydrates, 0.90% protein, 0.35% fat, 0.78% fiber, 0.6% ash, 48.70 (mg GAE/100g) total phenolic, 28.25 (mg/100 g) ascorbic acid and 153.53 (IC50 (mg/mL)) forantioxidant activity. Physicochemical, microbiological and sensory evaluation of flavored yoghurt samples were investigated during storage at 5 +/- 1 degrees Cfor 21 days. The results revealed that increases in total solids, protein, ash,and carbohydrates content were observed in the flavored probiotic yoghurtcompared to the control sample. Syneresis and WHC values of flavored yoghurt wereinfluenced by supplementation with WSP whether in fresh or stored samples.Furthermore, significant (P< 0.05) increases in ascorbic acid, antioxidantactivity, total phenols, vitamins, and minerals were observed in flavoredprobiotic yoghurt. Molds & yeast were not detected in all samples except in both control and probiotic yoghurt samples that appeared after 14 and 21 days.Similarly, coliforms were not found in all fresh and stored yoghurt samples.Sensory evaluation results showed that probiotic yoghurt flavored with 10% WSPhad the highest acceptance scores compared to other treatments.

AB  - Asthma, as a chronic inflammatory condition of the airways, has a considerableprevalence among children. Vitamin D might play a role in asthma pathogenesis by affecting the development of the lung, regulating the immune responses, andremodeling of airway smooth muscle (ASM). Study results on the associationbetween the serum level of vitamin D and asthma severity have suggested aconverse relationship between lower vitamin D levels and more severe clinicalcourses. However, they are not consistent in these findings and have showninsignificant correlations, as well. The possible effects of vitamin D on asthma have led researchers to consider this vitamin a potential prophylactic andtherapeutic tool for managing children with variant degrees of asthma. Addingvitamin D to the routine corticosteroid therapy of asthmatic children is another field of interest that has shown promising results. In this narrative reviewstudy, we aim to elaborate on the existing knowledge on the role of vitamin D in asthma pathogenesis and prognosis, explain the controversies that exist on theeffectiveness of treating patients with vitamin D supplements, and make a generalconclusion about how vitamin D actually is linked to asthma in children.

AB  - Vitamin D3 (VD3) is a potential adjuvant for use in tolerogenic vaccineformulations that target dendritic cells (DCs) for the treatment of chronicinflammatory disorders, e.g., autoimmune diseases. These disorders are oftenassociated with enhanced activity of IL-17-producing T helper 17 (Th17) cellswhich develop in a DC-driven and neutrophil-dependent fashion. Here, weinvestigated the effect of VD3 on Candida albicans-specific human T-celldifferentiation, since C. albicans is a model pathogen for Th17 cell development.VD3 priming of DCs restricted neutrophil-dependent Th17 cell development andneutrophil-independent Th1 cell formation from naive CD4(+) T cells. In line withthis, the production of Th1/Th17-polarizing cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 by DCs was reduced by VD3 priming. Development of both FoxP3(+)CD127lowCD25(+) Tregs andIL-10-producing T cells was significantly enhanced in VD3-primed conditions, evenin the presence of neutrophils. ICOS(+) Tregs, major IL-10 producers,CD69(+)FoxP3(+), and TIGIT(+)FoxP3(+) Tregs were significantly induced by VD3priming as well. Our data support the potential use of VD3 as an adjuvant toinduce tolerance in the treatment of autoimmune disorders, including those inwhich neutrophils are involved in pathogenesis, since we show that Tregdevelopment is enhanced by VD3 even in the presence of neutrophils, while Th17cell development is restricted.

AB  - Animals adjust their lipid metabolism states in response to pathogens infection. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for how lipid metabolism responds toinfection remain to be elusive. In this study, we assessed the temporal changesof lipid metabolism profiles during infection by an integrated transcriptomicsand lipidomics analysis. Ergosterol is identified to be required for proper host defense to pathogens. Notably, ergosterol level is increased in the hemolymphupon bacterial infection. We show that the increase of ergosterol level by foodsupplement or genetic depletion of Acsl, a long-chain fatty acid-CoA synthetase, promotes host survival against bacterial challenges. Together, our resultssuggest a critical role of lipid metabolism adaption in the process of hostdefense against invading pathogens.

PG  - 906186
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.906186 [doi]
AB  - Background: Enteral nutrition (EN) with foods for special medical purposes (FSMP)is recommended for most patients on home enteral nutrition (HEN). Although there are disease-specific guidelines for energy, protein, and micronutrient provision,only a few studies are showing real-life experience in the long-term use of FSMP.Methods: In a multicenter study, the influence of the FSMP composition andadministration technique (bolus vs. continuous) on protein and energy provisionin HEN was analyzed. Provision of vitamins and minerals was compared torecommended daily allowance (RDA) and upper tolerable limit (UL). Results:Approximately, 772 patients on HEN, mostly (88.6%) with oncological andneurological diseases, were enrolled. The patients on standard FSMP received lessprotein and energy than those on hypercaloric and protein enriched despitereceiving higher volumes of EN (p < 0.05). No differences were observed injejunal feeding with oligomeric vs. polymeric FSMP in terms of energy, protein,and volume. Continuous gastric feeding provided more protein, energy, and volume vs. bolus feeding (p < 0.05). Significant number of patients received less than100% RDA of vitamin D (50.5%), vitamin B3 (49%), vitamin K (21.8%), vitamin B5(64.3%), vitamin B9 (60%). Majority of the patients received less than 100% RDAof sodium (80.2%), potassium (99%), chloride (98%), calcium (67%), magnesium(87%), fluoride (99%), and iodine (43%). Approximately, 43.63% of cancer and49.9% of neurological patients received less than 1 g/kg/day of protein and 51.7%of cancer and 55.5% of neurological patients received less than 25 kcal/kg/day.Conclusion: Awareness of the available compositions of FSMP and advantageousprofiles of specific diets may lead to the implementation of recommendations for EN. HEN professionals need to analyze all the patient's needs and requirements toprovide more tailored matching of nutritional support.

AB  - Objectives: The fatty acid (FA) composition of breast milk is a relevant aspectrelated to the development of the lactating infant. The present study aimed atexploring correlations between dietary intake of macro- and micronutrients withthe FA profile in breast milk, and the possible implication for infants' growth. Study Design: Breast milk samples from a cohort of lactating women were collected7-15 days postpartum. The FA profiles in triacylglycerol (TAG) and phospholipid(PL)-rich fractions were analyzed by gas chromatography. Diet was registeredduring the third trimester of pregnancy by means of a food frequencyquestionnaire (FFQ). In addition, anthropometric measurements of infants werecollected from gestation and up to 12 months postpartum. Results: The FA profile in breast milk was characterized by a median of 37.4, 41.3 and 16.8% ofsaturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FAs, respectively. From thedietary components, zinc, iron, and B group vitamins were correlated positivelywith the proportion of total n-3 FAs in TAG and C20:5 n-3 in PL. Lycopene,vitamin E, zinc, and vitamin B2 showed a similar correlation with totalpolyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), total n-6 FAs, C20:4 n-6, and C18:2 n-6 inTAG. Regarding food groups, nuts showed the strongest association with severalPUFA both in TAG and PL, while the vegetable group was also positively associatedwith C18:3 n-3. Furthermore, the concentration of linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3) and palmitic acid (C16:0) were positively associated with increased length for age(LFA) and weight for age (WFA) at 12 months compared with birth [DeltaLFA -0.16(-0.85, 0.37); DeltaWFA -0.26 (-0.77, 0.21)]. Conclusions: Mothers' intake ofnuts, dietary sources of zinc, iron, and B group vitamins were identified aspotential predictors of a high-unsaturated FA profile in breast milk. Inaddition, linolenic and palmitic acids in breast milk were positively associated with infants' growth in the first year of life.

AB  - Vitamin D (VD) deficiency is associated with neuroinflammation and neurocognitivedeficits in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The present study wasaimed at investigating the therapeutic effects of VD and the molecular mechanismsafter TBI. After the intraperitoneal injection of VD (1 mug/kg), sensorimotor andcognitive function was assessed via a series of behavioral tests in TBI rats.Traumatic outcomes were investigated by brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB)disruption, and morphologic staining. In vitro, cellular viability andcytotoxicity in primary hippocampal neurons were detected via the MTT method and LDH release. Hippocampal oxidative stress-related enzymes and proinflammatorymediators and the serum concentration of VD were analyzed by ELISA. Theexpression of VDR, TLR4, MyD88, and NF-kappaB p65 was measured by Western blot.Furthermore, the levels of M1/M2 microglial markers were quantified usingreal-time PCR and Western blot. VD treatment significantly increased the serumlevel of VD and the hippocampal expression of VDR. VD not only effectivelyalleviated neurocognitive deficits, brain edema, and BBB disruption but alsopromoted hippocampal neuronal survival in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, VD therapyprevented excessive neuroinflammation and oxidative stress caused by TBI.Mechanically, the hippocampal expression of TLR4, MyD88, and nuclear NF-kappaBp65 was elevated in the TBI group but robustly restrained by VD treatment. Taken together, VD provides an important neuroprotection through modulating hippocampalmicroglial M2 polarization and neuroinflammation via the TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappaBpathway.

AB  - We report the first data on 25-hydroxyvitamin D plasma levels in naturalpopulations of three species of land iguana endemic to the Galapagos Islands(Conolophus marthae, C. subcristatus, and C. pallidus). The pigment is presentthroughout the whole body in the skin of C. subcristatus and C. pallidus. On the contrary, pigment is not present in the skin of an extended part of the body inC. marthae. The only existing population of C. marthae is syntopic with apopulation of C. subcristatus, and the two species are closely related. Thesecircumstances would suggest that, under the assumption that the species show asimilar basking behavior and in the absence of compensatory mechanisms, lighterpigmentation should favor higher vitamin D levels. Thus, C. marthae, comparedwith C. subcristatus in Wolf Volcano, could show higher levels of 25(OH)D plasma levels, or equal, if compensatory mechanisms exist. The three species showedlevels in the range of average values for healthy iguanas. However, contrary tothe expectation, C. marthae consistently exhibited the lowest 25(OH)D plasmalevels. We discuss possible factors affecting vitamin concentration andhypothesize that C. marthae may use the habitat to limit exposure to the high UVBirradiation at Wolf Volcano.

AB  - Edible oils include triglycerides that are extracted from oil seeds or fruitssuch as sunflowers, palms, olives, soys, rapeseeds, cocoa and many others. Theyare the elementary origins of unsaturated fats and vitamins especially vitamin'E' in people's diets. Edible oils are at risk of intentional (such as inadequatestorage conditions) and unintentional adulteration, so it is necessary to payattention to their safety, health and fraud. Generally, this evaluation can bedestructive or non-destructive. There are numerous methods to evaluate quality ofedible oils which include sensory analysis, chemical analysis, chromatography,ultrasound, etc. The Ultrasonic approach is a non-destructive way and also fast, accurate, inexpensive, repeatable, portable and simple. Combination of ultrasoundwith other techniques such as electronic nose, electronic tongue, visiblespectroscopic fingerprints, chemical descriptors, Raman spectroscopy,mid-infrared and machine vision, will improve quality evaluation and detectionaccuracy. This review summarizes the ultrasound idea and the latest knowledge of its application with other techniques on evaluation of edible oils.

AB  - COVID19 has emerged as one of the worst pandemics in the history of mankind.Several vaccines have been approved by different government agencies worldwide,but data on their efficacy and safety are limited, and distribution remains amassive challenge. As per WHO, personal immunity is vital for protection against COVID19. Earlier, Vitamin C-mediated pathways have been shown to play criticalrole in boosting immunity attributed to its antioxidant properties. Recently, theinvolvement of such pathways in protection against COVID19 has been suggested.The controlled doses of Vitamin C administered through intravenous (IV)injections are being studied for determining its role in the prognosis ofCOVID19. In this article, we have discussed the potential role of Vitamin C inthe management in COVID19 patients and presented recent clinical trials data.Additionally, we have elaborated the possibility of administering Vitamin Cthrough inhalers in order to achieve local high concentration and the challenges of such approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: We developed the world's first all-in-one type peripheralparenteral nutrition product containing dextrose, amino acids, fat emulsion,electrolytes and vitamins, according to the FDA 2000 recommendation. This phase Itrial examined the safety and changes in nutritional parameters in healthyparticipants. METHODS: A single-center, randomized, open-label, active-controlledtrial was performed in single ascending dose (SAD: Step 1-3) and multiple dose(Step 4) studies. Participants were administered a single dose of OPF-105 (testsolution: 150 g of dextrose, 60 g of amino acids, 40 g of fat, 1240 kcal of totalenergy per 2200 mL, and 106 NPC/N ratio, with multivitamins, n = 17) or BFI(control solution: 150 g of dextrose, 60 g of amino acids, 840 kcal of totalenergy per 2000 mL, and 64 NPC/N ratio, with vitamin B1, n = 18) with threeascending doses (Step 1: 550 mL, Step 2: 1100 mL, and Step 3: 2200 mL) in the SADstudy, or received multiple doses with Step 3 amount of OPF-105 (n = 5) or BFI (n= 6) for 3 days (Step 4) via peripherally inserted venous catheters. The safetyand nutritional parameters were assessed. RESULTS: There were no serious adverse events or events requiring discontinuation of the solution administration ineither group. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels remained within the normal rangein both groups (Step 1-4). However, they gradually increased during the timecourse of the study in the BFI group but not in the OPF group (Step 4),suggesting the prevention of body protein breakdown. Blood triglyceride (TG)levels increased after administration in the OPF group but promptly returned tothe pre-administration level (Step 1-4). Blood total ketone body levels increasedthe day after administration in both groups, which may imply a lower degree ofstarvation (Step 1-3), but the increase in the OPF group was milder than that in the BFI group (Step 4). Blood vitamin B6 and folic acid levels were maintainedwithin the normal ranges in the OPF group but were near the lower limit in theBFI group (Step 1-4). Blood vitamin C levels showed almost lower limit in the twogroups (Step 1-3), but increased only in the OPF group (Step 4). Blood vitamin K levels in the BFI group remained near the lower limit of the normal range, butthose in the OPF group were higher than the upper limit at the end ofadministration and quickly returned to the pre-administration level (Step 1-4).CONCLUSIONS: This trial suggests that the newly developed formula (OPF-105)improves fat metabolism, maintains vitamin profiles, and may prevent body proteinand fat breakdown and can be safely administered to healthy participants.Registration number of Clinical Trial: UMIN000046915;https://center6.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr_e/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000053479.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several studies have shown conflicting results for therelationship between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 outcomes. Here, we aimedto evaluate whether plasma 25(OH)D levels predict mortality in adults admittedwith COVID-19, considering potential confounders. METHODS: We conducted aretrospective cohort study that included 115 adults (age 62.1 +/- 17.6 years, 65 males) admitted to a Brazilian public hospital for severely symptomatic COVID-19.Subjects were classified into two groups according to their plasma levels of25(OH)D: sufficiency (>/=50 nmol/L) and the deficiency (<50 nmol/L). Thediagnosis of COVID-19 was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction(qPCR). In addition, direct competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay assessedserum 25(OH)D levels. RESULTS: The all-cause 30-day mortality was 13.8% (95% CI: 6.5%-21%) in the group of patients with sufficient plasma 25(OH)D levels and32.1% (95% CI: 14.8%-49.4%) among those with deficient plasma 25(OH)D levels. Coxregression showed that plasma 25(OH)D levels remained a significant predictor of mortality even after adjusting for the covariates sex, age, length of the delaybetween symptom onset and hospitalization, and disease severity (HR = 0.98, 95%CI: 0.96-1.00; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Vitamin D deficiency predicts highermortality risk in adults with COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Maternal vitamin-D deficiency is a significant healthconcern among pregnant women in the Middle East. Vitamin-D deficiency duringpregnancy has been associated with adverse maternal outcomes and an increasedrisk of pregnancy complications. This study aimed to identify the level ofvitamin-D during pregnancy and examine the effect of different vitamin-D levelsduring pregnancy on maternal outcomes. METHODS: A descriptive correctional designwas utilized in this research. This study was conducted at the obstetrics andgynecology outpatient clinics at Shaqra general hospital, Saudi Arabia. Apurposive sample of 221 pregnant women. Four tools were used: (1) a structuredinterviewing questionnaire; (2) laboratory records; (3) a vitamin-D risk factors assessment questionnaire; and (4) a follow-up sheet for maternal outcomes.RESULTS: Nearly half of the study sample (46.2%) had insufficient vitamin-D inthe blood, 40.3% had sufficient level of vitamin-D, and (13.6%) had a vitamin-Ddeficiency. The non-modifiable risk factors for vitamin D deficiency duringpregnancy were maternal age, dark skin pigmentation, hyperglycemia, anemia,mal-absorption syndrome, and genetic mutation. While the modifiable risk factors were inadequate sun exposure, middle-income status, low vitamin-D diet, obesity, and low consumption of milk products during pregnancy. There was a relationshipbetween adverse pregnancy outcomes and a vitamin-D deficiency during pregnancy (p< 0.001). CONCLUSION: Maternal vitamin-D deficiency is significantly associatedwith a high risk for emergency c-section and complications during pregnancy andlabor. Preconception intervention programs should focus on raising vitamin-Dlevels among pregnant women in Saudi Arabia to prevent vitamin-D deficient-linkedadverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Little is know on the association between mild or sub-clinicalvitamin B12 or D deficiencies and cognitive decline. The objective of the presentwork was to evaluate the association between vitamin B12 and D levels, andcognitive function in community-dwelling elders. METHODS: Cross-sectional studythat included data from elders who participated in the SABE study, apopulation-based study that was carried out in Ecuador. Participants of SABE wereselected by probabilistic sampling from the whole country. Vitamin B12 and D weremeasured in blood and cognitive status was assessed using an abbreviated version of the minimental state examination (MMSE). RESULTS: The sample included 1733elders from whom 936 (54.01%) were female. Independently from sex, age, years of education, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and geographical zone of residence, wefound that vitamin B12 levels were associated to MMSE scores and that thisrelationship changed depending on age. In this way, we observed that from 75years of age, drop of cognitive function was particularly steep in individualswith low levels of vitamin B12. We did not find evidence to support anassociation between vitamin D levels and cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: Lowlevels of vitamin B12 but not of vitamin D are associated with low cognitivefunctioning in a sample of community-dwelling elders.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is essential tothe management of acute kidney injury (AKI) in critical illness. Unfortunately,large quantities of micronutrients are shown to be lost in CRRT effluent. Currentliterature describes serum micronutrient values in CRRT patients to bebelow-reference range, yet seldom compares such values to other critically illpopulations unexposed to CRRT. The aim of this study was to describe and compare the prevalence of micronutrient and carnitine deficiencies in critically illpatients at high malnutrition risk exposed to CRRT to a group of patientunexposed to CRRT. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted at DukeUniversity Hospital using the electronic medical record. The study groupconsisted of patients at high malnutrition risk requiring intensive care unit(ICU) admission from 01/01/2017-12/31/2018 with one or more of the followingserum micronutrient levels checked: carnitine, copper, zinc, selenium, andvitamins B1, B6, B9, and C. Micronutrient deficiencies were defined as below the reference range and carnitine deficiencies were interpreted as an acyl to freecarnitine ratio (ACFR) of >0.4. RESULTS: 106 ICU patients met inclusion criteria and 46% were exposed to CRRT. At least one micronutrient deficiency was reported in 90% of CRRT patients compared to 61% patients unexposed to CRRT (p = 0.002). Agreater percentage of copper (p < 0.001) and carnitine (p < 0.001) deficiencieswere found among patients exposed to CRRT, while more zinc deficiencies werenoted among non-CRRT patients (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The vast majority of CRRTpatients presented with micronutrient deficiencies. Clinicians should have aheightened awareness of the risk for serum copper, carnitine, and vitamin B6deficiencies among CRRT patients. Further prospective and randomized-controlledtrials are needed to better define this new category of malnutrition and testsupplementation strategies to address and prevent these clinically-relevantdeficiencies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Childhood cancer survivors are at risk of unwanted lateeffects. The primary aim of this study was to assess bone mineral densityZ-scores (BMDz) in long-term survivors of childhood medulloblastoma (MB) orcentral nervous system supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (CNS-PNET).Secondary aims were to describe nutrient intake, vitamin D status, physicalactivity and explore potential risk factors for decreased BMDz. METHODS: All MBand CNS-PNET survivors treated at Oslo University Hospital from 1974 to 2013 wereinvited to participate in a cross-sectional study. Dual-energy x-rayabsorptiometry (Lunar Prodigy) assessed BMDz lumbar spine, BMDz total body, andlean body mass. Decreased BMDz was defined as a combination of low BMDz -1 to-1.99 and very low BMDz </=-2. Lean body mass index (LMI) was calculated bydividing lean body mass by the squared height. Nutrient intake was assessed by a 3-day food record. Serum 25(OH)D was analyzed. Physical activity was reported by a questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and multivariable Cox regression analyseswere applied. RESULTS: Fifty survivors with a median age of 25.5 years (5.5-51.9)and a median follow-up time of 19.5 years (3.2-40.5) were included. Mean BMDzlumbar spine was -0.8 (SD 1.1, 95% CI: -1.1 to -0.4), and BMDz total body was-0.6 (SD 1.1, 95% CI: -0.9 to -0.3). Decreased BMDz was detected in 48% of thelumbar spine and 34% of the total body measurements. In all, 62% had low calcium,and 69% had low vitamin D intake. 26% of participants had serum 25(OH)D < 50nmol/L, and 62% reported an inactive lifestyle. Male sex, higher age atdiagnosis, and lower LMI were potential risk factors for decreased BMDz.CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survivors of childhood MB and CNS-PNET had decreased BMDz,and risk factors were male sex, higher age at diagnosis, and lower LMI.Inadequate calcium and vitamin D intake, an inactive lifestyle, and a highprevalence of 25(OH)D </= 50 nmol/L were detected.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is an infectious disease whichled to a pandemic. Social isolation was therefore adopted as the main measure to prevent contamination and maintain public health. Some changes can occur instress levels, sleep quality, dietary consumption, and mood (such as levels ofanxiety and depression). The aim of this study is to describe the association andprediction between social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, symptoms ofstress, anxiety and depression, and food consumption self-reported. METHODS: Thiscross-sectional, quantitative, and descriptive study, with a non-probabilisticsample design for convenience, was carried out with 1,004 Brazilians, agedbetween 18 and 85 years old, from August to December 2020. A virtualquestionnaire was applied on socioeconomic and lifestyle data, changing in foodconsumption, and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) self-reported.The data were analyzed applying the chi-square test for comparison between maleand female, and a linear regression was applied to explore associations andpredictions of variables that may be strongly associated, using anxiety,depression and stress as dependent and self-reported changes in food consumption.The strength of association of each category of independent variables on thelevels of change in food consumption was estimated using beta coefficient and95%CI, in the SPSS software (version 26.0). RESULTS: Although most declared that consumption remained the same, a small important increase was detected in somegroups such as bread, pasta, potatoes, cassava. The consumption of plant-basedfoods remained unchanged according to the data collected. An increase of 13.25%of sugar sweetened beverages, 23.51% of alcoholic beverages, 37.25% of added ofsugar, and 20.42% of fast foods was self-reported, and 52.7% stopped or reducedthe practice of physical activity. The self-reported level of stress, anxiety,and depression reached 38.8%, 40.90% and 32.90. Changes in food consumption topredict stress, anxiety or depression symptoms were observed in relation todecrease red meat, fish, chicken, eggs, dairy, vegetables, legumes, and fruits,to increased consumption were associated to dairy, fats, sugar sweetenedbeverages, and fast foods. CONCLUSIONS: A remarkable increase in Fast foods andalcoholic beverages were observed. Carbohydrate-rich foods was associated tostress, and anxiety symptoms. The same was observed in increase of caloric foods such as fats, sugar sweetened beverages, and fast foods. Besides the decrease of proteins, vitamins, and fibers sources foods had a strength association withstress, anxiety, and depression symptoms.

AB  - Provitamin A carotenoids (pVACs) are important contributors to vitamin A statusand in reducing vitamin A deficiency in vulnerable populations. However, thereare uncertainties about the effectiveness of dietary pVACs to provide sufficient amounts of vitamin A due to large variations in provitamin A bioefficacy, and if provitamin A carotenoids other than beta-carotene could be utilized inbiofortification programs. Although animal studies have compared the bioefficacy of beta-cryptoxanthin and beta-carotene in biofortified maize by measuring liver retinol concentrations after dietary exposure, it is unclear whether the higherbioavailability of beta-cryptoxanthin can be offset by the lower conversion ofbeta-cryptoxanthin to retinol, and how post-intestinal conversion ofbeta-cryptoxanthin may contribute to the total bioefficacy of beta-cryptoxanthin.Here, we present a method that, for the first time, uses stable isotope labeledbeta-cryptoxanthin and beta-carotene to quantify bioconversion and bioefficacy ofboth pVACs simultaneously in human volunteers. The paper describes howpositioning of the [(13)C] labels around the centric 15,15' double bond on eitherthe beta-carotene or beta-cryptoxanthin molecule allows quantification ofretinoids from both pVACs, and details the procedure for sample preparation andanalysis using LC-MS/MS. Finally, we apply and discuss recent approaches toquantify bioconversion and bioefficacy of isotopically labeled beta-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin in humans.

AB  - Carotenoids are versatile isoprenoids of great importance in food science andnutrition. These compounds are natural colorants and key to combat vitamin Adeficiency, a major global nutritional problem. In addition, carotenoids havehealth-promoting biological actions that can contribute to reduce the risk ofserious diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, skin, bone and eyeconditions and metabolic disorders. Beneficial roles of carotenoids in cognition and fetal development are also attracting increased attention. The presence ofdouble bonds cause carotenoids to be prone to geometrical isomerization. Thedistinction among geometrical isomers of carotenoids is important as there can beimportant differences in terms of bioavailability, stability during processing oreven biological actions. This chapter summarizes strategies to separate andtentatively identify geometrical isomers of major dietary carotenoids(neoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, beta-cryptoxanthin,alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, phytoene and phytofluene).

AB  - L-ascorbic acid 2-glucoside (AA-2G) is a derivative of L-ascorbic acid (L-AA).Compared with L-AA, it has good stability and is easily decomposed by enzyme inthe human body. alpha-Glucosidase (AG) was the first enzyme found capable ofproducing AA-2G. However, researches on this enzyme is still in infancy. We took AG derived from Aspergillus niger (AAG), Japanese rice (JrAG) and Rattus rattus(RAG), and compared their specific enzymatic activity and transglycosidationrate, with the aim to improve the synthesis of AA-2G by the transglycosidation ofAG. The genes encoding these three different AG were cloned and expressed inengineered yeast. The conditions for the transglycosidation reaction of thesethree enzymes were optimized and the transglycosidation efficiency and yield ofAA-2G under the optimized conditions were compared. The specific activity of AAG reached 1.0 U/mg, while the yield of AA-2G reached 153.1 mg/L with atransglycosidation rate of 0.5%. The specific activity of RAG reached 0.4 U/mg,while the yield of AA-2G reached 861.0 mg/L with a transglycosidation rate of2.5%. JrAG showed the highest specific activity and transglycosidation rate. The enzyme specific activity of JrAG reached 1.9 U/mg, while the yield of AA-2Greached 2 577.2 mg/L with a transglycosidation rate of 7.6%, much higher thanthat of the other two glucosidases. JrAG may thus have potential to improve thesynthesis of AA-2G.

AB  - A polyphasic study was designed to resolve the taxonomic position of isolateMGRD01-02(T) which was recovered from an acidic hot spring in Indonesia andassigned to the genus Actinospica. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA genesequences show that the isolate is most closely related to the type strains ofActinospica acidiphila (98.5%), Actinospica robiniae (97.8%) and Actinospicadurhamensis (96.8%). Morphological and chemotaxonomic data underpin theassignment of the isolate to the genus Actinospica as it forms an extensivelybranched substrate mycelium which carries tufts of white aerial hyphae thatdifferentiate into straight to flexuous chains of cylindrical spores with faintrugose surfaces, contains 2,6-diamino-3-hydroxydiaminopimelic acid in thepeptidoglycan, mixtures of hydrogenated menaquinones with nine isoprene units,iso-C 15:O and iso-C 16:O as major fatty acids and phosphatidylethanolamine asthe diagnostic phospholipid. Whole-genome sequence analyses show that theisolate, A. durhamensis CSCA 57(T) and Actinocrinis puniceicyclus DSM 45168(T)have genome sizes of 7.9, 9.6 and 6.7 Mbp, respectively. A phylogenomic treeshows that they form distinct branches in a well-supported clade, a resultsupported by associated phenotypic data. Average nucleotide identity and digital DNA:DNA hybridization similarities are below the recommended thresholds forassigning strains to the same species; they also indicate that isolateMGRD01-02(T) is most closely related to the A. durhamensis and A. robiniaestrains. Corresponding amino acid identity and conserved protein data not onlysupport these relationships but also confirm the taxonomic integrity of the genusActinocrinis. Based on these results, it is proposed that isolate MGRD01-02(T) (=CCMM B1308(T) = ICEBB-09(T) = NCIMB 15218(T)) be classified in the genusActinospica as Actinospica acidithermotolerans sp. nov. The draft genome of theisolate and its closest phylogenomic neighbours contain biosynthetic geneclusters with the potential to produce new natural products, notably antibiotics.

TI  - Vitamin B12 status and folic acid/vitamin B12 related to the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus in pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis ofobservational studies.
PG  - 587
LID - 10.1186/s12884-022-04911-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This review was conducted to investigate the association betweenserum vitamin B12 levels as well as folic acid/vitamin B12 during pregnancy andthe risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: A comprehensive search of electronic databases (Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science) was performed. Theodds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of GDM risk were summarizedusing a random effects model. We also performed subgroup analyses to explore the source of heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies, including 10,595pregnant women were assessed. Women with vitamin B12 deficiency were at higherrisk for developing GDM when compared with those who were vitamin B12 sufficient (OR, 1.46; 95% CI 1.21-1.79; I(2): 59.0%). Subgroup analysis indicated that this association might differ based on sample size and geographical distribution.Elevated vitamin B12 levels may decrease the risk of GDM by 23%. The role ofexcess folic acid and low vitamin B12 levels in the occurrence of GDM is alsocontroversial. CONCLUSION: In summary, vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with increased risk of GDM, it is necessary to pay more attention to the balance ofvitamin B12 and folic acid. However, more in-depth studies across multiplepopulations are needed to verify these results.

AB  - In this paper, an oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsion (NE) prepared by water colddilution of an O/W microemulsion (ME) was introduced as a sample matrix inmicroemulsion electrokinetic capillary chromatography (MEEKC) for the highlyhydrophobic compounds analysis. Several model compounds with log PO/W values inthe 4.1-10.9 range, from different chemical groups, including retinol,alpha-tocopherol, cholecalciferol, phylloquinone, menaquinone-7,dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, ivermectin have been tested. As a proof of theconcept of NE formation, a dynamic light scattering technique was employed todetermine the size distribution profile of NE particles. Moreover, due torelatively low conductivity of the NE matrix (50-100 times lower in comparison tothe separation buffer) and a negative electric charge provided to hydrophobiccompounds through NE dispersed phase, NE matrices have been combined withpreconcentration techniques based on electrokinetic dosing, namely fieldamplified sample injection (FASI) and pressure assisted electrokinetic injection (PAEKI). The detection limits for vitamin K1 and K2-MK7 in the NE matrix incombination with FASI (NE-MEEKC-FASI) as well as PAEKI (NE-MEEKC-PAEKI) were upto 42.9 and 12.1 ng mL(-1), respectively. In comparison to standard hydrodynamic injection for microemulsion sample matrix NE-MEEKC-PAEKI grant 45-foldimprovement in signal sensitivity. The study presents an innovative approach, as it enables the use of preconcentration techniques for highly hydrophobiccompounds (log PO/W > 4), which was not previously possible for implementation inthe electromigration techniques. Likewise, the use of organic solvents has beenreduced by using ME as a solvent for stock solutions and diluting with waterprior to the analysis. The application to real samples was investigated using adietary supplement containing vitamin K2-MK7 obtained from the fermentationproduct of soybeans.

AB  - A Gram-negative, strictly aerobic, non-motile, rod-shaped bacterial strain CAU1614(T) was isolated from a marine sediment sample collected in the Republic ofKorea. Optimal growth of strain CAU 1614(T) proceeded at 30 degrees C, pH 7.0,and 2% (w/v) NaCl. 16S rRNA gene similarity was lower than 94.5% with generaAureisphaera, Marinirhabdus, Aureitalea, Gilvibacter, Ulvibacter, and Jejudonia. The highest similarity was with Aureisphaera galaxeae 04OKA003-7(T) (94.5%). The major cellular fatty acids were iso-C15:0, iso-C16:0, iso-C15:1 G, iso-C16:03-OH, and iso-C17:0 3-OH and the predominant menaquinone was MK-6. The polarlipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphoglycolipid, an unidentified lipid,two unidentified aminolipids, and an unidentified glycolipid. The draft genome ofstrain CAU 1614(T) was 3.9 Mb and DNA G+C content was 36.0 mol%. On the basis of the phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and genomic data, strain CAU 1614(T) presents anovel genus in the family Flavobacteriaceae, for which the nameHalomarinibacterium sedimenti gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain isCAU 1614(T) (= KCTC 82457(T) = MCCC 1K06083(T)).

TI  - Serum vitamin D level in healthy individuals versus patients with symptomatic andasymptomatic oral lichen planus.
PG  - 19-25
LID - 10.14715/cmb/2022.68.2.3 [doi]
AB  - The aetiology of oral lichen planus (OLP) is multifactorial, having variabletriggers. A role for vitamin D related to the immune system has been established.Vitamin D modulating effect is on the adaptive and innate immune responses. Ourstudy aimed to compare serum levels of vitamin D in patients having differentclinical symptoms of OLP (symptomatic or asymptomatic) with healthy individuals. Also, in this study, for further evaluation, the expression level ofinterleukin-17A and interleukin-6 (IL-17A and IL-6) was evaluated because thepresence of active vitamin D reduces the expression of these pro-inflammatoryfactors. This study was included three groups with 30 volunteers in each. Thefirst group included asymptomatic oral lichen planus patients (reticular orplaque-like lesions). The second group consisted of symptomatic oral lichenplanus patients (atrophic or bullous-erosive lesions). In contrast, the thirdgroup consisted of healthy control subjects. The serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D wasmeasured between the three groups and then correlated with clinical manifestationof oral lichen planus, either symptomatic or non-symptomatic. The Real-Time PCRtechnique was used to evaluate the expression of IL-17A and IL-6. Patients withsymptomatic OLP (second group) had statistically significantly lower Vitamin Dlevels than asymptomatic OLP patients (first group). Healthy Controls (thirdgroup) exhibited statistically significantly higher vitamin D levels than OLPgroups. The results of IL-17A and IL-6 genes expression showed that the presence of vitamin D had a statistically significant effect on reducing the expression ofthese two pro-inflammatory cytokines among symptomatic and asymptomatic OLPpatients. Also, the results showed that there was a statistically significantdifference between OLP patients (group I and II) and the control group (groupIII). In general, the current study results showed that lack of vitamin D had an important role in initiating or increasing the OLP's severity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to assess the clinical value of (18)F-PSMA-1007 and(68)Ga-PSMA-11 PET/MRI in the gross tumor volume (GTV) delineation ofradiotherapy for prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: Sixty-nine patients wereretrospectively enrolled (57 in the (18)F subgroup and 12 in the (68)Gasubgroup). Three physicians delineated the GTV and tumor length by the visualmethod and threshold method with thresholds of 30%, 40%, 50%, and 60% SUVmax. Thevolume correlation and differences in GTVs were assessed. The dice similaritycoefficient (DSC) was applied to estimate the spatial overlap between GTVs. For51 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy, the tumor length (Lpath) of themaximum area was measured, and compared with the longest tumor length obtainedbased on the images (LMRI, LPET/MRI, LPET, LPET30%, LPET40%, LPET50%, LPET60%) todetermine the best delineation method. RESULTS: In the (18)F subgroup, (1)GTV-PET/MRI (p < 0.001) was significantly different from the reference GTV-MRI.DSC between them was > 0.7. (2) GTV-MRI (R(2) = 0.462, p < 0.05) was theinfluencing factor of DSC. In the (68)Ga subgroup, (1) GTV-PET/MRI (p < 0.05) wassignificantly different from the reference GTV-MRI. DSC between them was > 0.7.(2) There was a significant correlation between GTV-MRI (r = 0.580, p < 0.05) andDSC. The longest tumor length measured by PET/MRI was in good agreement with thatmeasured by histopathological analysis in both subgroups. CONCLUSION: It isfeasible to visually delineate GTV on PSMA PET/MRI in PCa radiotherapy, and weemphasize the utility of PET/MRI fusion images in GTV delineation. In addition,the overlap degree was the highest between GTV-MRI and GTV-PET/MRI, and itincreased with increasing volume.

TI  - Vitamin D supplementation modulates autophagy in the pristane-induced lupusmodel.
PG  - 27
LID - 10.1186/s42358-022-00261-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Clinical evidence of skeletal muscle involvement is not uncommon in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Because of the poor understandingof signaling pathways involved in SLE muscle wasting, the aim of this study wasto evaluate the effects of vitamin D supplementation on skeletal muscle in micewith pristane-induced lupus. METHODS: Balb/c mice with lupus-like disease inducedby pristane injection were randomized into three groups: pristane-induced lupus(PIL; n = 10), pristane-induced lupus + vitamin D supplementation (PIL + VD; n = 10) and healthy controls (CO; n = 8). Physical function was evaluated on days 0, 60, 120 and 180. The tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius muscles were collectedto evaluate myofiber cross-sectional area (CSA) and protein expression. RESULTS: The PIL + VD group showed lower muscle strength compared to the CO and PIL groupsat different time points. PIL mice showed similar myofiber CSA compared to CO andPIL + VD groups. LC3-II expression was higher in PIL compared to CO and PIL + VD groups. MyoD expression was higher in PIL mice compared to PIL + VD, whilemyostatin expression was higher in PIL + VD than PIL group. Myogenin expressionlevels were decreased in the PIL + VD group compared with the CO group. The Akt, p62 and MuRF expressions and mobility assessment showed no significance.CONCLUSIONS: Changes in skeletal muscle in PIL model happen before CSA reduction,possibly due to autophagy degradation, and treatment with Vitamin D has a impact on physical function by decreasing muscle strength and time of fatigue.. Vitamin D supplementation has a potential role modulating physical parameters andsignaling pathways in muscle during pristane-induced lupus model.

TI  - Molecular mechanisms underlying the renal protective effects of coenzyme Q10 inacute kidney injury.
PG  - 57
LID - 10.1186/s11658-022-00361-5 [doi]
AB  - Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an endogenous antioxidant, has been reported frequently to exert an outstanding protective effect on multiple organ injury, including acute kidney injury (AKI). In this study, we aim to summarize all the current evidence of the protective action of CoQ10 against AKI as there are presently no relevant reviews in the literature. After a systematic search, 20 eligible studies, eitherclinical trials or experimental studies, were included and further reviewed.CoQ10 treatment exhibited a potent renal protective effect on various types ofAKI, such as AKI induced by drugs (e.g., ochratoxin A, cisplatin, gentamicin,L-NAME, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), extracorporeal shock wavelithotripsy (ESWL), sepsis, contrast media, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. The renal protective role of CoQ10 against AKI might be mediated by theantiperoxidative, anti-apoptotic, and anti-inflammatory potential of CoQ10. Themolecular mechanisms for the protective effects of CoQ10 might be attributed tothe regulation of multiple essential genes (e.g., caspase-3, p53, and PON1) andsignaling cascades (e.g., Nrf2/HO-1 pathway). This review highlights that CoQ10may be a potential strategy in the treatment of AKI.

TI  - Robust osteogenic efficacy of 2alpha-heteroarylalkyl vitamin D analogue AH-1 inVDR (R270L) hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets model rats.
PG  - 12517
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16819-7 [doi]
AB  - Active vitamin D form 1alpha,25-dihydroxtvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) plays pivotalroles in calcium homeostasis and osteogenesis via its transcription regulationeffect via binding to vitamin D receptor (VDR). Mutated VDR often causeshereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets (VDDR) type II, and patients with VDDR-II are hardly responsive to physiological doses of 1,25(OH)D3. Current therapeuticapproaches, including high doses of oral calcium and supraphysiologic doses of1,25(OH)2D3, have limited success and fail to improve the quality of life ofaffected patients. Thus, various vitamin D analogues have been developed astherapeutic options. In our previous study, we generated genetically modifiedrats with mutated Vdr(R270L), an ortholog of human VDR(R274L) isolated from thepatients with VDDR-II. The significant reduced affinity toward 1,25(OH)2D3 of ratVdr(R270L) enabled us to evaluate biological activities of exogenous VDR ligandwithout 1alpha-hydroxy group such as 25(OH)D3. In this study,2alpha-[2-(tetrazol-2-yl)ethyl]-1alpha,25(OH)2D3 (AH-1) exerted much higheraffinity for Vdr(R270L) in in vitro ligand binding assay than both 25(OH)D3 and1,25(OH)2D3. A robust osteogenic activity of AH-1 was observed in Vdr(R270L)rats. Only a 40-fold lower dose of AH-1 than that of 25(OH)D3 was effective inameliorating rickets symptoms in Vdr(R270L) rats. Therefore, AH-1 may bepromising for the therapy of VDDR-II with VDR(R274L).

AB  - Anticoagulants are a major component of rodenticides used worldwide, whichfunction by effectively blocking the vitamin K cycle in rodents. The rat Vitamin K epoxide Reductase Complex (VKORC) subunit 1 is the enzyme responsible forrecycling vitamin K, and five substitution mutations (Tyr139Cys, Tyr139Ser,Tyr139Phe and Leu128Gln and Leu120Gln) located in the VKORC1 could result inresistance to anticoagulant rodenticides. This study carried out a VKORC1-basedsurvey to estimate the anticoagulant rodenticide resistance in three Rattusspecies (R. losea, R. norvegicus, and R. tanezumi) collected in Hong Kong. Atotal of 202 rats captured in Hong Kong between 2017 and 2021 were analysed.Sequencing of molecular marker cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COX1) was carried out to assist the species identification, and the identities of 52 lesserricefield rats (R. losea), 81 common rats (R. norvegicus) and 69 house rats (R.tanezumi) were confirmed. Three VKORC1 exons were amplified from individuals byPCR followed by Sanger sequencing. A total of 47 R. tanezumi (68.1%) containedTyr139Cys mutation in VKORC1 gene, and half of them were homozygous. None of the collected R. losea and R. norvegicus were detected with the five knownsubstitutions leading to anticoagulant rodenticides resistance, and previouslyundescribed missense mutations were revealed in each species. Whole genomesequencing was further carried out on some individuals, and single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs) were also identified in the introns. This is the first studyinvestigating the situation of anticoagulant rodenticide resistance in the ratscollected in Hong Kong. Given that the efficacy of rodenticides is crucial foreffective rodent management, regular genetic testing as well as populationgenomic analyses will be required to both monitor the situation and understandthe adaption of different rat haplotypes for integrated pest management.Susceptibility tests for individual rodenticides should also be conductedregularly to assess their effectiveness on local species.

AB  - The study investigates the use of fiber carriers, based on biopolymeric gums aspotential candidates for cosmetic and dermatological applications, in particular for skin regeneration. Gum arabic (GA), xanthan gum (XA), and gum karaya (GK)were used as the main gum materials for the fibers, which were prepared bycentrifugal spinning from an aqueous solution. These solutions of different mass gum ratios were blended with poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) for better spinnability.Finally, vitamins E and C were added to selected solutions of gums. The resultingfibers were extensively investigated. The morphology and structure of all fibers were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transformedinfrared spectroscopy. Most importantly, they were characterized by the releaseof vitamin E loaded in the fibers using UV-VIS spectroscopy. The presentationwill show that the newly prepared fibers from GA and PEO represent a verypromising material for cosmetic and dermatologic applications.

AB  - Malnutrition in children with chronic cholestasis is a prevalent issue and amajor risk factor for adverse outcomes. Fat soluble vitamin (FSV) deficiency isan integral feature of cholestatic disease in children, often occurring withinthe first months of life in those with neonatal cholestasis and malnutrition.This review focuses on FSVs in cholestasis, with particular emphasis on apractical approach to surveillance and supplementation that includes approachesthat account for differing local resources. The overarching strategy suggested isto incorporate recognition of FSV deficiencies in cholestatic children in orderto develop practical plans for close monitoring and aggressive FSV repletion.Routine attention to FSV assessment and supplementation in cholestatic infantswill reduce long periods of inadequate levels and subsequent adverse clinicalsequalae.

AB  - In biological engineering, cell immobilization is a modern technique forimmobilizing free cells in a small space. Disintegration and elimination of azodyes [Reactive Orange 122 (orange 2RL) and Reactive Red 194 (Reactive Red M-2BF)]were investigated by using Chlorococcum sp. and Chlorococcum sp. mixed withScenedesmus obliquus, respectively. After 7 days of incubation, the maximumdecolorization was spotted at 40 ppm for Reactive Orange 122 and 20 ppm forReactive Red 194 by Chlorococcum sp. and Chlorococcum sp. mixed with S. obliquus,respectively. The findings revealed that the best decolorization activity wasfound at pH 11 and 25 degrees C under aeration conditions. BG11 was consideredthe best medium for azo dye decolorization with a high decolorization percentage.Additionally, different concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus show the highactivity of decolorization of both dyes. Referring to vitamins (thiamin andAscorbic acid), all studied concentrations showed high decolorization activitywith immobilized Chlorococcum sp. mixed with S. obliquus; however, differentconcentrations (20, 40, and 60 mg/l) of thiamin showed completely decolorization of Reactive Red 194 after 3 days, and 60 mg/l of ascorbic acid showed completely decolorization of Reactive Orange 122 after 5 days of inoculation. FT-IR andGC-Ms analysis for azo dyes after and before treatment with Immobilization ofChlorococcum sp. and Chlorococcum sp. mixed with Scenedesmus obliquus weredetected. Novelty statement: The natural carrier algae and its consortiumcombined with a suitable immobilization technique were considered in this study, which is non-toxic, enhanced their bioremediation potential for dyes, and allowedmultiple uses of biocatalysts. The novel use of the immobilization and itsconsortium of algae on the degradation efficiency of azo dyes and studying theeffect of physicochemical conditions on decolorization and degradation of azodyes. Application of immobilization techniques using microalgae could beexcellent bioremediation of wastewaters.

TI  - TNB-738, a biparatopic antibody, boosts intracellular NAD+ by inhibiting CD38ecto-enzyme activity.
PG  - 2095949
LID - 10.1080/19420862.2022.2095949 [doi]
AB  - Cluster of differentiation 38 (CD38) is an ecto-enzyme expressed primarily onimmune cells that metabolize nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) toadenosine diphosphate ribose or cyclic ADP-ribose and nicotinamide. Othersubstrates of CD38 include nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate andnicotinamide mononucleotide, a critical NAD+ precursor in the salvage pathway.NAD+ is an important coenzyme involved in several metabolic pathways and is arequired cofactor for the function of sirtuins (SIRTs) and poly (adenosinediphosphate-ribose) polymerases. Declines in NAD+ levels are associated withmetabolic and inflammatory diseases, aging, and neurodegenerative disorders. Toinhibit CD38 enzyme activity and boost NAD+ levels, we developed TNB-738, ananti-CD38 biparatopic antibody that pairs two non-competing heavy chain-onlyantibodies in a bispecific format. By simultaneously binding two distinctepitopes on CD38, TNB-738 potently inhibited its enzymatic activity, which inturn boosted intracellular NAD+ levels and SIRT activities. Due to its silencedIgG4 Fc, TNB-738 did not deplete CD38-expressing cells, in contrast to theclinically available anti-CD38 antibodies, daratumumab, and isatuximab. TNB-738offers numerous advantages compared to other NAD-boosting therapeutics, includingsmall molecules, and supplements, due to its long half-life, specificity, safety profile, and activity. Overall, TNB-738 represents a novel treatment with broadtherapeutic potential for metabolic and inflammatory diseases associated withNAD+ deficiencies.Abbreviations: 7-AAD: 7-aminoactinomycin D; ADCC: antibodydependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity; ADCP: antibody dependent cell-mediatedphagocytosis; ADPR: adenosine diphosphate ribose; APC: allophycocyanin; cADPR:cyclic ADP-ribose; cDNA: complementary DNA; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CD38:cluster of differentiation 38; CDC: complement dependent cytotoxicity; CFA:Freund's complete adjuvant; CHO: Chinese hamster ovary; CCP4: collaborativecomputational project, number 4; COOT: crystallographic object-oriented toolkit; DAPI: 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid; DSC:differential scanning calorimetry; 3D: three dimensional; epsilonNAD+:nicotinamide 1,N6-ethenoadenine dinucleotide; ECD: extracellular domain; EGF:epidermal growth factor; FACS: fluorescence activated cell sorting; FcgammaR: Fc gamma receptors; FITC: fluorescein isothiocyanate; HEK: human embryonic kidney;HEPES: 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid; IgG: immunoglobulin;IFA: incomplete Freund's adjuvant; IFNgamma: Interferon gamma; KB: kineticbuffer; kDa: kilodalton; KEGG: kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes; LDH:lactate dehydrogenase; M: molar; mM: millimolar; MFI: mean fluorescent intensity;NA: nicotinic acid; NAD: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NADP: nicotinamideadenine dinucleotide phosphate; NAM: nicotinamide; NGS: next-generationsequencing; NHS/EDC: N-Hydroxysuccinimide/ ethyl (dimethylamino propyl)carbodiimide; Ni-NTA: nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; nL: nanoliter; NK: naturalkiller; NMN: nicotinamide mononucleotide; OD: optical density; PARP: poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PDB: protein data bank; PE: phycoerythrin;PISA: protein interfaces, surfaces, and assemblies: PK: pharmacokinetics; mol:picomolar; RNA: ribonucleic acid; RLU: relative luminescence units; rpm:rotations per minute; RU: resonance unit; SEC: size exclusion chromatography;SEM: standard error of the mean; SIRT: sirtuins; SPR: surface plasmon resonance; microg: microgram; microM: micromolar; microL: microliter.

AB  - Distinct nuclear structures and bodies are involved in genome intranuclearpositioning. Measuring proximity and relative distances of genomic loci to these nuclear compartments, and correlating this chromosome intranuclear positioningwith epigenetic marks and functional readouts genome-wide, will be required toappreciate the true extent to which this nuclear compartmentalization contributesto regulation of genome functions. Here we present detailed protocols forTSA-seq, the first sequencing-based method for estimation of cytologicalproximity of chromosomal loci to spatially discrete nuclear structures, such asnuclear bodies or the nuclear lamina. TSA-seq uses Tyramide Signal Amplification (TSA) of immunostained cells to create a concentration gradient oftyramide-biotin free radicals which decays exponentially as a function ofdistance from a point-source target. Reaction of these free radicals with DNAdeposits tyramide-biotin onto DNA as a function of distance from the pointsource. The relative enrichment of this tyramide-labeled DNA versus input DNA,revealed by DNA sequencing, can then be used as a "cytological ruler" to inferrelative, or even absolute, mean chromosomal distances from immunostained nuclearcompartments. TSA-seq mapping is highly reproducible and largely independent ofthe target protein or antibody choice for labeling a particular nuclearcompartment. Our protocols include variations in TSA labeling conditions toprovide varying spatial resolution as well as enhanced sensitivity. Our moststreamlined protocol produces TSA-seq spatial mapping over a distance range of ~1micron from major nuclear compartments using ~10-20 million cells.

TI  - Repeated social defeat stress exacerbates lipopolysaccharide-induced behavioural deficits in mice: ameliorative role of Chrysophyllum albidum fruit extractthrough anti-neuroinflammation, antioxidant and neurochemical balance.
LID - 10.1007/s11011-022-01053-x [doi]
AB  - Development of neuropsychiatric disorder is associated with stress-relatedincrease in pro-inflammatory cytokines. Chrysophyllum albidum fruit is an edible tropical fruit containing vitamins and phenolic compounds, well known for theiranti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. This study was designed toinvestigate the neuroprotective effect of C. albidum fruit extract (CAFE) onstress and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced behavioral and neurochemicalimpairments in mice. Male Swiss mice were divided into 6 groups (n = 6). Groups1-3 were orally treated daily for 14 days with normal saline (0.1 mL/10 g), CAFE (100 mg/kg) and Ferulic acid (FA, 10 mg/kg), and left in home cage as controls.Groups 4-6 were treated similarly but subjected to repeated social defeat (RSD)stress using the resident-intruder model from days 1-14. The RSD-animals wereinjected with LPS (125 microg/kg, i.p) 60 min after each RSD session from days8-14. Neurobehavioral functions: locomotor, cognitive and anxiety-like behaviors were assessed 24 h after the last treatment. Pro-inflammatory cytokines(IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha), dopamine, acetylcholinesterase, glutamic aciddecarboxylase (GAD), malondialdehyde, nitrites, and reduced glutathione (GSH)were determined in brain tissue. CAFE significantly attenuated RSD andLPS-induced hypolocomotion, cognitive impairment and anxiety-like behavior whencompared to the control. Treatment with CAFE also significantly reversed thenegative effects of RSD and LPS on pro-inflammatory cytokines, dopamine,acetylcholinesterase, GAD, and oxidative-nitrosative stress levels. The findings clearly indicated that Chrysophyllum albidum fruit demonstrated neuroprotectiveeffects and can play a key role in mitigating against chronic stress andinflammation linked to neuropsychiatric disorders.

PG  - e29623
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000029623 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels are common in patients withchronic heart failure (HF) and are associated with increased mortality risk. Thisstudy aimed to establish the safety and efficacy of oral vitamin D3(cholecalciferol) supplementation and its effect on endothelial and ventricularfunction in patients with stable HF. METHODS: This study was aninvestigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Seventy-three HF patients with 25OHD levels < 75 nmol/L (30 ng/mL) wererandomized to receive 4000 IU vitamin D daily or a placebo for 6 months. Theprimary endpoint was a change in endothelial function between the baseline andafter 6 months as assessed using EndoPAT. Secondary endpoints included changes inechocardiographic parameters and differences in quality of life (6-min walkingtest and New York Heart Association functional status) at 6 months. RESULTS:There were no adverse events in either group during the study period. Vitamin Dsupplementation did not improve endothelial dysfunction (EndoPAT: baseline, 1.19 +/- 0.4 vs 6 months later, 1.22 +/- 0.3, P = .65). However, patients' bloodpressure, 6-min walking distance, and EQ-5D questionnaire scores improved aftervitamin D treatment. In addition, a significant reduction in the left atrialdiameter was observed. CONCLUSION: A daily vitamin D dose of 4000 IU for chronic HF appears to be safe. This dosage did not improve endothelial function but didimprove the 6-min walk distance, symptoms, and left atrial diameter at 6 months.

TI  - Effects of the Topical Use of the Natural Antioxidant Alpha-Lipoic Acid on theOcular Surface of Diabetic Patients with Dry Eye Symptoms.
PG  - 202
LID - 10.31083/j.fbl2707202 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of the treatmentwith eye-drops based on a combination of antioxidant and mucomimetic molecules,namely 0.1% alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and 0.3% hydroxy-propyl-methylcellulose(HPMC) on the ocular surface of diabetic patients with dry eye symptoms. METHODS:Seventy patients, 42 M and 28 F, aged from 50 to79 years (mean 62.1 +/- 10.5),affected by type II diabetes mellitus, were enrolled and divided in two groupstreated for 2 months as follows: Group 1 (35 patients), received topical ALA/HPMCthree times a day, Group 2 (35 patients) received topical HPMC (0.3%) alone,three times a day. The main outcome measures were: Ocular Surface Disease Index(OSDI), tear film break-up time (TBUT), corneal fluorescein staining, Schirmer I test, corneal sensitivity. An examination of tear film morphology with confocalmicroscopy was carried out in a subset of patients of each group at baseline and after two months. Statistical analysis was performed with t-test for theparametric data and Mann-Whitney U-test or chi-squared test for the nonparametricdata. RESULTS: Both treatments resulted in significant improvements of BUT, OSDI and tear film morphology, although the improvements observed in group 1 showed a higher trend than what observed for group 2. Moreover, only in group 1 asignificant improvement was visible for corneal staining, and no significantimprovements were observed in any group for Schirmer I and sensitivity.CONCLUSIONS: These results confirmed the efficacy of HPMC in the treatment ofdiabetic dry eye and indicated that the addition of a strong self-regeneratingantioxidant like ALA may give a distinctive advantage for the healing of corneal defects (as evidenced by corneal staining), beside improving HPMC efficacy onthree other parameters (BUT, OSDI score, tear morphology). Therefore, theaddition of a strong antioxidant like ALA can be helpful in preventing ortreating ocular surface defects in diabetic patients, in which the oxidativedamage is predominant.

AB  - Intrahepatic cholestasis is the most common hepatobiliary complication ofpregnancy. Worsening cholestasis, measured by total bile acid levels, has beenassociated with an increased incidence of adverse fetal outcomes; however,maternal morbidity remains rare. This report highlights a case of severefat-soluble vitamin deficiency suspected to be secondary to severe cholestasis.Active management with weekly vitamin supplementation and close outpatientfollow-up resulted in the delivery of a 32-week healthy neonate. We proposeconsideration of screening for fat-soluble vitamin deficiency for patients whose pregnancy is complicated by severe cholestasis or early-onset cholestasis.

AB  - Herein, we report two acute ischemic stroke cases that we used prothrombincomplex to reverse the effects of warfarin in order to apply intravenousthrombolytic treatment. To the best of our knowledge, there are only limitedamount of cases that prothrombin complex concentrates were applied prior tointravenous thrombolytic treatment administration. As one of the biggest acutestroke clinics in our country, we aim to open a discussion for this treatment to be fully researched and understood.

TI  - Carnitine-Acylcarnitine Translocase Deficiency
BTI - GeneReviews((R))
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) is acritical component of the carnitine shuttle, which facilitates the transfer oflong-chain fatty acylcarnitines across the inner mitochondrial membrane. CACTdeficiency causes a defect in mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation,with variable clinical severity. Severe neonatal-onset disease is most common,with symptoms evident within two days after birth; attenuated cases may presentin the first months of life. Hyperammonemia and cardiac arrhythmia are prominent in early-onset disease, with high rates of cardiac arrest. Other clinicalfeatures are typical for disorders of long-chain fatty acid oxidation: poorfeeding, lethargy, hypoketotic hypoglycemia, hypotonia, transaminitis, liverdysfunction with hepatomegaly, and rhabdomyolysis. Univentricular orbiventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, ranging from mild to severe, mayrespond to appropriate dietary and medical therapies. Hyperammonemia is difficultto treat and is an important determinant of long-term neurocognitive outcome.Affected individuals with early-onset disease typically experience brain injuryat presentation, and have recurrent hyperammonemia leading to developmental delay/ intellectual disability. Affected individuals with later-onset disease havemilder symptoms and are less likely to experience recurrent hyperammonemia,allowing a better developmental outcome. Prompt treatment of the presentingepisode to prevent hypoglycemic, hypoxic, or hyperammonemic brain injury mayallow normal growth and development. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Characteristic elevation of long-chain acylcarnitines C16, C18, and C18:1 on acylcarnitine profilesuggests a diagnosis of CACT or CPT II deficiency. The diagnosis of CACTdeficiency is confirmed by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants inSLC25A20, or in some cases by identifying reduced CACT enzyme activity in skinfibroblasts. MANAGEMENT: Routine daily treatment of manifestations: The mainstay of therapy is a high-carbohydrate diet (>60% of total caloric intake) withrestriction of long-chain dietary fat (to <10% of total calories) and treatmentwith the anaplerotic agent triheptanoin (to provide 25%-35% of total calories).If triheptanoin is not available, medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) oil (10%-30% oftotal calories) could be used as a substitute. Fasting is avoided or limited, andcarnitine supplemented at ~100 mg/kg/day is recommended. Goals of care includeoptimization of caloric intake to avoid or reduce hyperammonemia (ammoniascavenger medications are of limited efficacy in this condition) and aggressiverehabilitation therapy, including physical and occupational therapy, to addressmotor delays. Placement of a feeding tube and/or feeding therapy may be required in those with feeding issues. Emergency treatment of manifestations:Administration of high-dextrose-containing fluids: oral/enteral carbohydratepolymer (at home) or intravenous dextrose (in the hospital). Hyperammonemia ismost sensitive to high rates of dextrose infusion (12-15 g/kg/day glucose forinfants and 10-12 g/kg/day for children age 1-6 years), while ammonia scavenging medications (sodium benzoate, sodium phenylbutyrate) are of limited efficacy.Cardiac arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and acute renal impairmentshould be treated per standard of care, typically in the intensive care unit.Consideration should be given for triheptanoin treatment in those withcardiogenic shock. Prevention of secondary complications: A home emergency planfor prompt illness management should be provided to parents, primary careproviders, teachers, and school staff. When undergoing surgeries or procedures(e.g., dental interventions or neuroimaging requiring sedation), pre-procedurehospital management includes IV dextrose with electrolytes appropriate for age.Provide the family with an emergency plan and letter for use during emergencydepartment visits. Surveillance: Regular evaluations by a metabolic specialistand metabolic dietitian. Measurement of growth parameters (including headcircumference) and monitoring of developmental milestones at each visit.Neuropsychological testing using age-appropriate tools as clinically indicated.Laboratory monitoring to include serum ammonia level, total CK level, ALT, AST,glucose, electrolytes, and albumin levels for periodic surveillance as clinicallyindicated. Measurement of complete blood count, ferritin level, prealbumin, CRP, essential fatty acids, calcium, magnesium, phosphate, copper, zinc, selenium,folate, and vitamins A, D, E, and B12 annually after the first year of life.Measurement of plasma electrolytes, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and/orcystatin C levels for renal monitoring as clinically indicated. Echocardiogram toassess for cardiomyopathy or cardiac dysfunction annually and as clinicallyindicated. EKG or 24-hour Holter test periodically, as clinically indicated.Consider EEG or neuroimaging in those with new neurologic symptoms or alteredmental status. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged fasting, catabolicillness (fever, intercurrent infection), inadequate caloric provision duringtimes of catabolic stress (including during fasting), prolonged strenuousphysical activity, and prolonged administration of anesthetics containing highlevels of long-chain fatty acids (e.g., propofol). Evaluation of relatives atrisk: Testing of all at-risk sibs of any age is warranted to allow for earlydiagnosis and treatment of CACT deficiency. For at-risk newborn sibs whenprenatal testing was not performed, in parallel with newborn screening eithertest for the familial SLC25A20 pathogenic variants or measure acylcarnitineprofile. GENETIC COUNSELING: CACT deficiency is inherited in an autosomalrecessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for an SLC25A20pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25%chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a25% chance of inheriting neither of the familial SLC25A20 pathogenic variants andbeing unaffected. Heterozygotes (carriers) are asymptomatic. Once the SLC25A20pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carriertesting for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testingare possible.

TI  - Metagenomic insights into the microbe-mediated B and K2 vitamin biosynthesis inthe gastrointestinal microbiome of ruminants.
PG  - 109

AB  - BACKGROUND: B and K2 vitamins, essential nutrients in host metabolism, can besynthesized by the rumen microbiome in ruminants and subsequently absorbed by thehost. However, the B and K2 vitamin biosynthesis by the whole gastrointestinalmicrobiome and their abundances in different dietary strategies are largelyunknown. Here, we reanalyzed our previous large-scale metagenomic data on thegastrointestinal microbiome of seven ruminant species and recruited 17,425nonredundant microbial genomes from published datasets to gain a comprehensiveunderstanding of the microbe-mediated B and K2 vitamin biosynthesis in ruminants.RESULTS: We identified 1,135,807 genes and 167 enzymes involved in B and K2vitamin biosynthesis. Our results indicated that the total abundances of B and K2vitamin biosynthesis were dominant in the stomach microbiome, while thebiosynthesis of thiamine, niacin, and pyridoxine was more abundant in the largeintestine. By examining 17,425 nonredundant genomes, we identified 2366high-quality genomes that were predicted to de novo biosynthesize at least onevitamin. Genomic analysis suggested that only 2.7% of these genomes cansynthesize five or more vitamins, and nearly half of genomes can synthesize only one vitamin. Moreover, we found that most genomes possessed cobalamintransporters or cobalamin-dependent enzymes to consume cobalamin directly, andonly a few microbial genomes possessed a complete cobalamin biosynthesis pathway.Based on these genomic data, we examined the effect of the high-grain (HG) dieton the vitamin biosynthesis of the rumen microbiome of dairy cattle. We revealed that most vitamin biosynthesis was enhanced in the HG group, while only cobalaminsynthesis was inhibited in the HG group, indicating that dietary fiber is vitalfor cobalamin biosynthesis. CONCLUSIONS: We primarily provided a gene catalog and2366 microbial genomes involved in B and K2 vitamin biosynthesis in ruminants.Our findings demonstrated the regional heterogeneity and dietary effect ofvitamin biosynthetic potential in the ruminant gastrointestinal microbiome andinterpreted the biosynthesis mechanisms of these microbes and their physiologicaladaptability. This study expands our understanding of microbe-mediated vitaminbiosynthesis in ruminants and may provide novel targets for manipulation toimprove the production of these essential vitamins.

PG  - 437
LID - 10.1186/s12887-022-03493-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Caffeine is a routinely prescribed pharmacological active compound inneonatal intensive care units (NICU) for treating apnea of prematurity (AOP),which also decreases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and cerebral palsy inneonates. Caffeine-induced excessive calcium loss can promote the development of metabolic bone disease (MBD) in preterm neonates. This study aimed to evaluatethe effect of the caffeine regimen on the development of osteopenia ofprematurity (OOP), using serum alkaline phosphatase (serum-ALP) concentrations asa surrogate marker at the 4(th) week of life. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted including neonates of < 32 weeks gestational age (GA) andbirth weight < 1500 g, admitted to NICU from April-2017 to December-2018 andreceived caffeine therapy till 28 days of life for AOP. Based on serum-ALPlevels, formed the high and low-ALP groups. Neonatal characteristics, caffeineregimen, risk factors for OOP, including duration of parenteral nutrition (PN),exposure to medicines associated with MBD, and intake of essential vitamins andminerals, were compared in both groups. Predictors of OOP were analyzed throughlogistic regression. RESULTS: From the total of 268 participants, 52 (19%)developed OOP, mostly female (61.5%). In the high ALP group, the serum-ALP levelswere significantly higher than in the low-ALP group (725.0 +/- 143.8 vs 273.6 +/-55.0 units/L, p < 0.001). The high-ALP group received significantly (p < 0.001)higher daily and cumulative caffeine doses and were associated with a higherlikelihood of developing OOP in this study cohort [cumulative dose (mg) (AOR =1.082 95% CI 1.011 to 1.157) and daily dose (mg/kg/day) (AOR = 2.892 95% CI 1.392to 6.007)]. Smaller GA was found directly related to OOP. Among the other medicalrisk factors, phosphorus intake was significantly low in the high-ALP group. No, significant relationship between duration of PN and use of steroids anddiuretics, and intake of vitamins and minerals were identified. CONCLUSION: Thedaily and cumulative doses of caffeine and smaller GA are associated with thedevelopment of OOP in this study cohort. Clinical randomized control studies are needed to validate the outcomes and determine the range of safest and mosteffective caffeine doses for treating AOP in preterm neonates.

TI  - Assessing the potential determinants of national vitamin A supplementation among children aged 6-35 months in Ethiopia: further analysis of the 2019 EthiopianMini Demographic and Health Survey.
PG  - 439
LID - 10.1186/s12887-022-03499-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin A is a nutrient that is required in a small amount for normalvisual system function, growth and development, epithelia's cellular integrity,immune function, and reproduction. Vitamin A has a significant and clinicallyimportant effect since it has been associated with a reduction in all-cause anddiarrhea mortality. The aim of this study was to determine factors associatedwith national vitamin A supplementation among children aged 6-35 months. METHOD: The data for this study was extracted from the 2019 Ethiopian Mini Demographicand Health Survey. A total weighted sample of 2242 women with children aged 6-35 months was included in the study. The analysis was performed using Stata version 14.2 software. Applying sampling weight for descriptive statistics and complexsample design for inferential statistics, a manual backward stepwise elimination approach was applied. Finally, statistical significance declared at the level of p value < 0.05. RESULT: The overall coverage of vitamin A supplementation amongchildren aged 6-35 months for the survey included was 44.4 95% CI (40.15, 48.74).In the multivariable analysis, mothers who had four or more antenatal visits [AOR= 2.02 (95% CI: 1.34, 3.04)] were two times more likely to receive vitamin Acapsules for their children than mothers who had no antenatal visits. Childrenfrom middle-wealth quintiles had higher odds of receiving vitamin A capsules incomparison to children from the poorest wealth quintile [AOR = 1.77 (95% CI:1.14, 2.73)]. Older children had higher odds of receiving vitamin A capsules thanthe youngest ones. Other factors that were associated with vitamin Asupplementation were mode of delivery and region. CONCLUSION: The coverage ofvitamin A supplementation in Ethiopia remains low and it is strongly associatedwith antenatal visit, household wealth index and age of child. Expanding maternalhealth services like antenatal care visits should be prioritized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Five-fluorouracil, folinic acid, oxaliplatin and irinotecan(FOLFOXIRI) regimen is used as the first-line treatment for metastatic colorectalcancer (mCRC). The use of capecitabine, an oral fluoropyrimidine pro-drug, isfeasible and safe; hence, it provides an interesting alternative to5-fluorouracil in the abovementioned regimen. This study aimed to evaluate theefficacy and safety of capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (XELOXIRI)regimen use with or without targeted drugs in Chinese patients with mCRC.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, longitudinal cohort study of patients withmCRC who received XELOXIRI regimen with or without targeted drugs (bevacizumab orcetuximab) every 2 weeks between January 2017 and November 2019 at the NationalCancer Center/Cancer Hospital, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, andPeking Union Medical College. Treatment efficacy was assessed by investigators byevaluating the objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR).Overall survival (OS) was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Theadverse events were also analyzed. RESULTS: Sixty-one consecutive patients wereexamined and followed up for survival. As of November 8, 2021, the medianfollow-up time was 35.4 months. Disease progression and death occurred in 50(82%) and 38 (62%) patients, respectively. The median treatment duration ofXELOXIRI with or without bevacizumab or cetuximab was 10 cycles (range, 1-12cycles). The median OS and PFS were 32.2 months (95%CI [24.8-39.6]) and 9.3months (95% CI [8.1-10.5]), respectively. The ORR of 48 patients with measurable lesions was 70.8%, and the DCR was 89.6%. RAS/BRAF wild-type (HR 0.39; 95% CI[0.16-0.96], p = 0.04) and metastatic organs > 2 (HR 3.25; 95% CI [1.34-7.87], p = 0.009) were independent prognostic factors for OS. The incidence of any gradeof adverse events (AEs) was 96.7% (59/61). Grade >/= 3 AEs included neutropenia(19.7%), leukopenia (9.8%), diarrhea (3.3%), vomiting (3.3%), febrile neutropenia(1.6%), and thrombocytopenia (1.6%). No treatment-related death occurred.CONCLUSION: The use of the XELOXIRI regimen with or without a targeted drug waseffective, with a manageable toxicity profile in Chinese patients with mCRC.

AB  - Several strikingly different aerobic and anaerobic pathways of nicotinatebreakdown are extant in bacteria. Here, through reverse genetics and analyticaltechniques we elucidated in Aspergillus nidulans, a complete eukaryoticnicotinate utilization pathway. The pathway extant in this fungus and otherascomycetes, is quite different from bacterial ones. All intermediate metaboliteswere identified. The cognate proteins, encoded by eleven genes (hxn) mapping inthree clusters are co-regulated by a specific transcription factor. Severalenzymatic steps have no prokaryotic equivalent and two metabolites,3-hydroxypiperidine-2,6-dione and 5,6-dihydroxypiperidine-2-one, have not beenidentified previously in any organism, the latter being a novel chemicalcompound. Hydrolytic ring opening results in alpha-hydroxyglutaramate, a compoundnot detected in analogous prokaryotic pathways. Our earlier phylogenetic analysisof Hxn proteins together with this complete biochemical pathway illustratesconvergent evolution of catabolic pathways between fungi and bacteria.

PG  - 12484
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16599-0 [doi]
AB  - Enzymes with dedicated cofactor preference are essential for advancedbiocatalysis and biomanufacturing, especially when employing nonnaturalnicotinamide cofactors in redox reactions. However, directed evolution of anenzyme to switch its cofactor preference is often hindered by the lack ofefficient and affordable method for screening as the cofactor per se or thesubstrate can be prohibitively expensive. Here, we developed a growth-basedselection platform to identify nonnatural cofactor-dependent oxidoreductasemutants. The growth of bacteria depended on the nicotinamide cytosinedinucleotide (NCD) mediated conversion of non-metabolizable phosphite intophosphate. The strain BW14329 lacking the ability to oxidize phosphite wassuitable as host, and NCD-dependent phosphite dehydrogenase (Pdh*) is essentialto the selection platform. Previously confirmed NCD synthetase with NCD synthesiscapacity and NCD-dependent malic enzyme were successfully identified by using theplatform. The feasibility of this strategy was successfully demonstrated usingderived NCD-active malic enzyme as well as for the directed evolution of NCDsynthetase in Escherichia coli. A phosphite-based screening platform was builtfor identification of enzymes favoring nonnatural cofactor NCD. In the future,once Pdh variants favoring other biomimetic or nonnatural cofactors are availablethis selection platform may be readily redesigned to attain new enzyme variantswith anticipated cofactor preference, providing opportunities to further expandthe chemical space of redox cofactors in chemical biology and synthetic biology.

TI  - Synthesis of new cinnamoyl-amino acid conjugates and in vitro cytotoxicity andgenotoxicity studies.
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.202200426 [doi]
AB  - Amino acid conjugates are described by the reaction of amino acids with bioactiveorganic groups such as vitamins, hormones, flavonoids, steroids, and sugars. Inthis study, 12 new conjugates were synthesized by reaction of cinnamic acidderivatives with various amino acids. Cytotoxic studies against four differenthuman cancer cells (MCF7, PC-3, Caco-2, and A2780) were carried out by MTT assay method at five different concentrations. The structure-activity relationshipsbased on the cell viability rates were evaluated. To compare the anticanceractivities of the compounds using computational chemistry methods, they weredocked against A2780 human ovarian cancer, Michigan Cancer Foundation-7 (MCF7),human prostate cancer (PC-3) and human colon epidermal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2)cell lines and compared with the standard 5-Fluorouracil. The results indicatethat the efficacy of cinnamic acid derivatives increases with the presence ofamino acids. Comet assay was conducted to understand whether the cell deathsoccur through DNA damage mechanism and the results exhibit that the changes inthe specified parameters were statistically significant (P<0.05). Our studydemonstrated that the compounds cause cell death through the formation of DNAdamage mechanism.

AB  - Limosilactobacillus fermentum KUB-D18 is a heterofermentative lactic acidbacterium that its potential probiotic relevance originally isolated from thechicken intestine. This study sequenced a whole-genome of L. fermentum KUB-D18and annotated its genes and functions in relation to probiotic properties. As aresult, the genome sequence of L. fermentum KUB-D18 approximately contained 2.02 Mbps with GC content of51.7%. After annotating the genome by integrated proteinand pathway databases, 2,158 protein-encoding genes were majorly annotated formetabolisms of amino acids, carbohydrates and cofactors as well as vitamins whichshowed a versatile metabolic capability to gastrointestinal microhabitats.According to the comparative genome analysis of L. fermentum KUB-D18 and theother related strains, L. fermentum KUB-D18 showed common characteristics e.g.,folate biosynthesis and bile salt hydrolase enzymes-related cholesterol lowering effect as well as a unique gene cluster involved in metabolism of l-ascorbic acidof L. fermentum KUB-D18. Taken together, L. fermentum KUB-D18 genome provides thegenetic basis towards cellular capability for further elucidating the functional mechanisms of its probiotic properties. This study serves for designing desirabletargets for the development of probiotic foods and feeds.

AB  - AIM: The chronic administration of vitamin C and E can differentially disrupthepatic insulin molecular pathway in rats. Hence, this study evaluated theireffects on lipogenesis in the liver and adipose tissue and investigated thepossible involvement of microRNA (miR)-22/29a/27a in the induced impaired glucosetolerance. MAIN METHODS: Wistar rats were orally supplemented with vitamin C(100, 200, and 500 mg/kg) or vitamin E (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg) for eight months.KEY FINDINGS: Vitamin C or E at the highest doses significantly altered liverweight and index, serum and hepatic lipids, adiponectin, and liver enzymes;besides their reported unfavorable effect on glucose homeostasis. Vitamin C and Enegatively affected peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor coactivator-1(PGC-1alpha), sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1c/-2,miR-22/29a/27a expression, and adipose perilipin 1 to different extents, effects that were supported by the histopathological examination. SIGNIFICANCE: Thecurrent study provides a deeper insight into the findings of our previous studyand highlights the detrimental effects of chronic vitamins supplementation onlipid metabolism. Overall, these findings emphasize the damage caused by themindless use of supplements and reinforce the role of strict medical monitoring, particularly during the new COVID-19 era during which numerous commercialsupplements are claiming to improve immunity.

PG  - e0180321
LID - 10.1128/aem.01803-21 [doi]
AB  - Interactions between bacteria and phytoplankton can influence primary production,community composition, and algal bloom development. However, these interactionsare poorly described for many consortia, particularly for freshwaterbloom-forming cyanobacteria. Here, we assessed the gene content and expression oftwo uncultivated Acidobacteria from Lake Erie Microcystis blooms. These organismswere targeted because they were previously identified as important catalaseproducers in Microcystis blooms, suggesting that they protect Microcystis fromH2O2. Metatranscriptomics revealed that both Acidobacteria transcribed genes for uptake of organic compounds that are known cyanobacterial products and exudates, including lactate, glycolate, amino acids, peptides, and cobalamins. Expressedgenes for amino acid metabolism and peptide transport and degradation suggestthat use of amino acids and peptides by Acidobacteria may regenerate nitrogen forcyanobacteria and other organisms. The Acidobacteria genomes lacked genes forbiosynthesis of cobalamins but expressed genes for its transport and remodeling. This indicates that the Acidobacteria obtained cobalamins externally, potentiallyfrom Microcystis, which has a complete gene repertoire for pseudocobalaminbiosynthesis; expressed them in field samples; and produced pseudocobalamin inaxenic culture. Both Acidobacteria were detected in Microcystis blooms worldwide.Together, the data support the hypotheses that uncultured and previouslyunidentified Acidobacteria taxa exchange metabolites with phytoplankton duringharmful cyanobacterial blooms and influence nitrogen available to phytoplankton. Thus, novel Acidobacteria may play a role in cyanobacterial physiology and bloom development. IMPORTANCE Interactions between heterotrophic bacteria andphytoplankton influence competition and successions between phytoplankton taxa,thereby influencing ecosystem-wide processes such as carbon cycling and algalbloom development. The cyanobacterium Microcystis forms harmful blooms infreshwaters worldwide and grows in buoyant colonies that harbor other bacteria intheir phycospheres. Bacteria in the phycosphere and in the surrounding community likely influence Microcystis physiology and ecology and thus the development offreshwater harmful cyanobacterial blooms. However, the impacts and mechanisms of interaction between bacteria and Microcystis are not fully understood. This studyexplores the mechanisms of interaction between Microcystis and uncultured membersof its phycosphere in situ with population genome resolution to investigate thecooccurrence of Microcystis and freshwater Acidobacteria in blooms worldwide.

TI  - Vaccination status, favipiravir, and micronutrient supplementation roles inpost-COVID symptoms: A longitudinal study.
PG  - e0271385
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271385 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Post-COVID symptoms are the new concern in the COVID-19 pandemic,where recovered patients experience residual symptoms affecting their quality of life. Therefore, it is imperative to evaluate the role of complete vaccination,prescribed medication, and micronutrients during COVID episodes in the occurrenceof post-COVID symptoms. METHOD: A longitudinal evaluation of Indonesia'srecovered COVID-19 patients was performed using the data collected from July 2021and extracted in mid-February 2022. All participants were confirmed with aReal-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction test (PCR) and/or antigen test. This studycollected demography and comorbidities information, symptoms and treatment ofCOVID-19, and collection of self-reported post-COVID symptoms every 30 dayswithin 90 days after diagnosis/onset. Exposures of interest include vaccinationstatus, Favipiravir administration, Vitamin C, Vitamin D, and Zinc. A GeneralizedEstimating Equation (GEE) was used to evaluate the longitudinal effect ofexposures, presented with adjusted odds ratios and its 95% confidence interval.RESULTS: A total of 923 participants (18.2% fully-vaccinated) were involved inthe study, with 79.7% being non-hospitalized. Only 25.7% did not develop anyresidual symptoms within 90 days. Fatigue was the most reported post-COVIDsymptom in each measurement time (39.5%, 16.3%, and 7.3%). Full-vaccination waseffective against chronic cough (aOR 0.527, 95% CI 0.286-0.971), chronic headache(aOR 0.317, 95% CI 0.163-0.616), and chronic arthritis (aOR 0.285, 95% CI0.116-0.703). The combination of micronutrient supplementations and Favipiravirgave no significant effect on all post-COVID symptoms. However, early initiation of Favipiravir and delaying vitamin D administration were associated witharthritis. CONCLUSION: Full vaccination of COVID-19 prevents the disease and the development of residual symptoms when infected with SARS-COV-2. Hence, it iscrucial to reconsider the prescription of micronutrient supplementation or adjustthe dose of Favipiravir in the current guideline.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the effect of an isocaloric multifactorial diet with a dietrich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and similar macronutrient composition on pancreatic fat (PF) and postprandial insulin response in type 2 diabetes(T2D). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: According to a randomized controlledparallel-group design, 39 individuals with T2D, 35-75 years old, in satisfactory blood glucose control, were assigned to an 8 week isocaloric intervention with a multifactorial diet rich in MUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fiber,polyphenols, and vitamins (n = 18) or a MUFA-rich diet (n = 21). Before/after theintervention, PF content was measured by the proton-density fat fraction using a three-dimensional mDIXON MRI sequence, and plasma insulin and glucoseconcentrations were measured over a 4 h test meal with a similar composition asthe assigned diet. RESULTS: After 8 weeks, PF significantly decreased after themultifactorial diet (from 15.7 +/- 6.5% to 14.1 +/- 6.3%; P = 0.024), while itdid not change after the MUFA diet (from 17.1 +/- 10.1% to 18.6 +/- 10.6%; P =0.139) with a significant difference between diets (P = 0.014). Postprandialglucose response was similar in the two groups. Early postprandial insulinresponse (incremental postprandial areas under the curve [iAUC0-120])significantly increased with the multifactorial diet (from 36,340 +/- 34,954 to44,138 +/- 31,878 pmol/L/min; P = 0.037), while it did not change significantlyin the MUFA diet (from 31,754 +/- 18,446 to 26,976 +/- 12,265 pmol/L/min; P =0.178), with a significant difference between diets (P = 0.023). Changes in PFinversely correlated with changes in early postprandial insulin response (r =-0.383; P = 0.023). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with T2D, an isocaloricmultifactorial diet, including several beneficial dietary components, markedlyreduced PF. This reduction was associated with an improved postprandial insulinresponse.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the lifestyle of a selected group ofinhabitants of the Mazowieckie Voivodeship before the pandemic and to analyse theimpact of lockdown on changes in lifestyle, including changes in the consumption of selected food products that are a source of vitamins and minerals. In August2020, a survey was conducted based on a proprietary questionnaire. It was shownthat during the lockdown period, 24.7% of women and 27.1% of men made changes in their lives. The changes concerned working hours, nature of work, hours of sleep,number of meals consumed and diet. The analysis of the diet showed a decrease in the consumption of vegetables, fruits and legumes in some respondents, which,with low frequency of consumption, may lead to a deficiency of dietary fibre,vitamin C, folic acid, polyphenols and potassium. The consumption of fish,spreadable fats, salt, sugar and drinks was not compliant with therecommendations of healthy eating. Public education about healthy lifestyles isessential to prevent complications from COVID-19.

TI  - Prevalence of Postoperative Micronutrient Deficiencies in Bariatric SurgeryPatients Who Use Transdermal Patches for Supplementation: A Pilot Study.
PG  - e25989
LID - 10.7759/cureus.25989 [doi]
AB  - Background Patients require vitamin and mineral supplementation after bariatricsurgery to prevent the development of micronutrient deficiencies. Consuming oral supplements is challenging due to gastric volume restriction. A transdermal patchdosage form may provide adequate micronutrient supplementation without pillburden. The study aims to determine the percentage of patients who have two ormore nutritional deficiencies one year after surgery and to determine serumnutrient concentrations and gastrointestinal symptoms over time. Methods Patientswho planned to undergo bariatric surgery and preferred transdermal patches versusoral supplements were recruited during preoperative office visits. Enrolledpatients were instructed to use a transdermal multivitamin patch as per themanufacturer's instructions. Serum nutrient concentrations and GastrointestinalSymptom Response Scale scores were determined at baseline and three months, sixmonths, and one year after surgery. Results Ninety-two participants completed thestudy protocol. Twenty-five participants had a full panel of study labs one year after surgery. Among these patients, 19% had two or more micronutrientdeficiencies. Vitamin D was the most common deficiency followed by vitamin B6;however, median serum concentrations of both nutrients increased over time.Vitamin B1, folate, and zinc deficiencies were also observed. There were nochanges in gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusions Additional studies, includingrandomized controlled trials, are required to determine if the PatchMDMultivitamin Plus patch (Pilot Rd. STE. B, Las Vegas) can provide adequatesupplementation of vitamins and minerals. The patch was not associated withchanges in gastrointestinal symptoms.

TI  - Controlled release of vitamin D3 using a nanocellulose-based membrane.
PG  - 12411
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16179-2 [doi]
AB  - Epidemiological studies show that a significant fraction of the global populationpresents low levels of vitamin D3. In order to address this problem, one way toadminister the vitamin is to incorporate it in novel drug delivery systems, such as transdermal devices. A possible substance for this purpose is cellulose, whichhas a long history of use in the health area. However, the application ofnanostructured cellulose membranes, as local drug delivery systems, remains achallenge. To develop a crystalline nanocellulose membrane as a new tool for the release of vitamin D3. A new nanostructured membrane containing nanocelluloseextracted from cotton linter and vitamin D3 was produced using the "casting"technique. The membrane was characterized using high-resolution scanning electronmicroscopy (FEG-SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Thekinetics of vitamin release was quantified using molecular spectroscopy (UV-Vis).The FT-IR spectra showed the presence of all the active components in themembrane sample, without structural alterations or the formation of new bonds.The FEG-SEM images showed the presence of vitamin crystals on the surface and in the interior of the membrane. The release of vitamin D3 occurred in a sustainedmanner, obtaining 3029 IU mL(-1) of vitamin D3 in 60 min. The findingsdemonstrated that the membrane could be used for the sustained release of vitaminD3. This new biomaterial has potential as a new model for vitamin supplementationin individuals with vitamin D3 deficiency.

TI  - The Impact of Different Rose Bengal Formulations on Corneal Thickness and theEfficacy of Rose Bengal/Green Light Corneal Cross-linking in the Rabbit Eye.
PG  - 450-458
LID - 10.3928/1081597X-20220601-03 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine central corneal thickness (CCT) changes during in vivo rosebengal-green light corneal cross-linking (RG-CXL) and compare the CXL efficacy ofdifferent rose bengal formulations. METHODS: After epithelium removal, the right eyes of rabbits were immersed in rose bengal solution prepared by differentsolvents (water, phosphate buffered saline, dextran, and hydroxypropylmethylcellulos [HPMC]) for 2 or 20 minutes, then the rose bengal distribution in the corneal stroma was analyzed by confocal fluorescence detection. During theRG-CXL process, the CCT was measured at seven time points. The left eyes servedas the untreated control group. Corneal enzymatic resistance and cornealbiomechanics were tested to compare the RG-CXL efficacy. RESULTS: The rose bengalinfiltration depths were 120 and 200 microm for the 2- and 20-minute groups,respectively. CCT increased significantly after infiltration, then decreasedsignificantly in the first 200 seconds of irradiation and decreased slowly forthe next 400 seconds. The CCT of the 20-minute groups was significantly thickerthan that of the 2-minute groups (P < .0001). All RG-CXL treatments improved the corneal enzymatic resistance and corneal biomechanics, with the effects beinggreater in the 20-minute groups. The inclusion of 1.1% HPMC in the rose bengalformulation helped to maintain CCT during irradiation while not affecting either the infiltration of rose bengal or the efficacy of RG-CXL. CONCLUSIONS: Withinthe range studied, RG-CXL efficacy increased with infiltration time. Theincorporation of a 20-minute infiltration of 0.1% rose bengal-1.1% HPMC into the RG-CXL procedure may further improve the safety of the treatment and itsprospects for clinical use.

TI  - Malus asiatica as a natural host of apple scar skin viroid in China.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-04-22-0827-PDN [doi]
AB  - Malus asiatica (Rosaceae, Malus) is a small deciduous tree, which has beencultivated in China more than 450 years (Jin, 2019). M. asiatica is deeplyfavored by consumers because of its sweet taste and high nutritional attributes, rich in vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber (Xue et al, 2013). Although the M.asiatica annual output is nearly 30 000 kg, it still cannot meet the marketdemand in China (Jin, 2019). In August 2021, the virus-like symptom such ascolored spots on fruit epidermis of M. asiatica were observed in an orchard ofLangfang (38 degrees 42'16.88''N, 116 degrees 39'15.23''E) of Hebei province,China. To investigate whether this symptom is related to virus infection, thesymptomatic sample was subjected to small RNA sequencing. Total RNA was extractedfrom branch bark of a symptomatic tree using an RNAprep Pure Plant Kit (TianGen, China), The extracted RNA was used to construct a small RNA library usingNEBNext(R) Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina(R) (Set 1), (NEB,USA), then the resulting library was sequenced using Illumina novoseq 6000(Illumina, USA) at Tianjin Novogene company (China). A total of 14,685,616sequence reads were obtained. After filtering the low-quality reads, polyA,adaptor contaminants, fragments < 18 nt and > 26 nt, and reads matching applegenome, the number of reads reduced to 392,883. Finally, assembly of these clean reads generated 225 non-redundant contigs with Velvet software and 55 assembledcontigs were aligned to Refseq viral database of NCBI by Bowtie software. Oneviral contig with length of 329 nt showed 98.48% significant similarity to genomesequences of Hohhot isolate of ASSVd (ASSVd-Hohhot) (GenBank Accession No.MZ476527.1) (Yuan et al, 2022). We then used a specific primer pair (ASSVd-F:5'-G G T A A A C A C C G T G C G G T T C C-3'; ASSVd-R: 5'-G G G A A A C A C C A A T T G T G T T T T A-3') for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR to amplify thegenome sequence of ASSVd. A 330 bp amplified product was cloned into the pGEM-Teasy vector (Promega, USA), then sequenced by Sanger sequencing using T7 primerby Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. in China. The sequence of ASSVd has beendeposited in the GenBank datebase (GenBank Accession No. ON093255). Blastanalysis showed that the sequence had highest identity (326/330, 98.79%) withASSVd-Hohhot (GenBank Accession No. MZ476527.1) (Yuan et al, 2022). To confirmthe pathogenicity of ASSVd, fifteen healthy cucumber seedlings were inoculatedmechanically with the extracts of ASSVd-infected branch bark of M. asiatica.There were no obvious symptoms were observed at 14 days post inoculation (dpi),however, the result of RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing showed four cucumber samples were positive for ASSVd. In addition, another 19 randomly collected M. asiaticasamples with or without clear symptoms from Langfang were detected by RT-PCR, andten (52.6%) of them were confirmed the presence of ASSVd. And all ten positivesamples were symptomatic, while nine nonsymptomatic M. asiatica samples testednegative. The positive amplicons were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector andsequenced using T7 primer by Sanger sequencing. All of the sequences wereessentially identical to one another (GenBank Accession No. ON093255), whichindicates that the positive samples are indeed ASSVd infected. To the best of ourknowledge, this is the first report of ASSVd infection in M. asiatica, whichexpands our understanding of the host range of ASSVd.

PG  - 334-341
LID - 10.7417/CT.2022.2442 [doi]
AB  - Background: Nowadays, excess weight is reaching epidemic proportions and it isnecessary to identify patients at greater metabolic risk, in order to determinethe most suitable pharmacological and dietetic options. On the other hand,vitamin D insufficiency (or hypovitaminosis D) is prevalent in obese patients. Itmost commonly occurs in people with inadequate sunlight exposure and nutritional intake of vitamin D, disorders limiting vitamin D absorption, and conditionsimpairing vitamin D conversion into active metabolite, including certain liver,kidney, and hereditary disorders. It can impair bone mineralization, leading toan increased risk of bone fractures. However, the correlation between thehypovitaminosis D and overweight is poorly understood. Aim: This study aims toevaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, correlating it to the status of body fat and lipid profile in an adult population from the Italian region ofAbruzzo. Methods: A total of 135 participants (BMI>/= 18.5 kg/m(2)) were enrolledin this observational study: face-to-face interview and physical examination wereconducted during their initial evaluation, and their serum and anthropometricparameters were assessed. Results: Among study participants higher BMI, WC, WHtR and WHR were associated to lower vitamin D values, especially in females: acomparison between its values and anthropometric indicators is important to guidethe preliminary prevention and early detection of vitamin D insufficiency ingeneral population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In infants, vitamin B12 deficiency is mainly due to nutritionaldeficiencies related to maternal deficit. Most cases of maternal deficiencies areassociated with vegetarian diets. Pernicious anemia is an au toimmune diseasethat affects the absorption of this vitamin. Although it is less common thannutri tional deficiency, is also an important cause of maternal deficiency.OBJECTIVE: to report a case of an infant with vitB12 deficiency, secondary topernicious anemia in his mother, and to review the most important aspects of thisdisease in childhood. CLINICAL CASE: Nine months-old male infant, withoutpathological perinatal history, exclusively breastfed, with persistent rejection of solid food from 6 months of age. One month before hospitalization, heprogressively presented hyporesponsiveness, with fluctuating state of alertness, regression of motor development milestones, and vomiting. The blood count showed macrocytic anemia and neutropenia. Vitamin B12 deficiency was confirmed in thepatient. He received treatment with intramuscular vitamin B12 with good clinical and laboratory response. Maternal B12 deficiency was confirmed as the cause ofthe infant's deficiency. Since the mother reported no dietary restrictions,anti-intrinsic factor and anti-parietal cell antibodies were measured, leading tothe diagnosis of pernicious anemia. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition is essentialto prevent the development of potentially irreversible neurological damage.Maternal pernicious ane mia should be considered in children with megaloblasticanemia, especially in those whose mothers do not follow vegetarian diets.

AB  - Vitamin D (VD) is essential for calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Its deficiencycan cause rickets. In Chile, newborns receive 400UI/day supplementation from the first day of age until the first year. OBJECTIVE: To describe the VD plasmalevels in healthy infants who received supplementation and secondarily tocorrelate this with seasonality and nutritional status. SUBJECTS AND METHOD:Cross sectional study. Infants on exclusive or mixed breastfeeding, with monthly pediatric checkups recei ving 400 UI VD supplementation were evaluated, measuringVD plasma levels at 6 months of age, weight, and length, and their nutritionalstatus was classified according to the WHO growth referen ces (weight/age andweight/length). The VD cut-off concentration values were < 20 ng/ml, 21- 29 ng/ml, and >/= 30 ng/ml considered as deficiency, insufficiency, and sufficiency,respectively. RESULTS: 40 infants were studied, 40% had insufficient levels and40% presented deficiency. Season and nutritio nal status were variablessignificantly related to lower VD values (Winter-Spring p = 0.007; at risk ofmalnutrition p = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: The population who received supplementationpresented a high frequency of VD deficiency and insufficiency which increasesduring winter and spring and in subjects at risk of malnutrition.

TI  - Vitamin D resistant genes - promising therapeutic targets of chronic diseases.
PG  - 7984-7998

AB  - Vitamin D is an essential vitamin indispensable for calcium and phosphatemetabolism, and its deficiency has been implicated in several extra-skeletalpathologies, including cancer and chronic kidney disease. Synthesizedendogenously in the layers of the skin by the action of UV-B radiation, thevitamin maintains the integrity of the bones, teeth, and muscles and is involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, and immunity. The deficiency of Vit-D is increasing at an alarming rate, with nearly 32% of children and adults beingeither deficient or having insufficient levels. This has been attributed to Vit-Dresistant genes that cause a reduction in circulatory Vit-D levels through a set of signaling pathways. CYP24A1, SMRT, and SNAIL are three genes responsible forVit-D resistance as their activity either lowers the circulatory levels of Vit-D or reduces its availability in target tissues. The hydroxylase CYP24A1inactivates analogs and prohormonal and/or hormonal forms of calcitriol.Elevation of the expression of CYP24A1 is the major cause of exacerbation ofseveral diseases. CYP24A1 is rate-limiting, and its induction has been correlatedwith increased prognosis of diseases, while loss of function mutations causehypersensitivity to Vit-D. The silencing mediator of retinoic acid and thyroidhormone receptor (SMRT) and its corepressor are involved in the transcriptionalrepression of VDR-target genes. SNAIL1 (SNAIL), SNAIL2 (Slug), and SNAIL3 (Smuc) are involved in transcriptional repression and binding to histone deacetylasesand methyltransferases in addition to recruiting polycomb repressive complexes tothe target gene promoters. An inverse relationship between the levels ofcalcitriol and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition is reported. Studies havedemonstrated a strong association between Vit-D deficiency and chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancers, autoimmune diseases,infectious diseases, etc. Vit-D resistant genes associated with theaforementioned chronic diseases could serve as potential therapeutic targets.This review focuses on the basic structures and mechanisms of the repression ofVit-D regulated genes and highlights the role of Vit-D resistant genes in chronicdiseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The occurrence of side effects related to the use of combined oralcontraceptives (COCs) - or even the fear of them - often affects patients'compliance and their quality of life. Such adverse effects include both physical and psychological alterations. Therapies based on COCs are related to lowerlevels of vitamins and minerals, including vitamins B, C and E, zinc, magnesium, and selenium. This review gathers scientific evidence about the effectiveness of the administration of specific micronutrients to address nutritional needs andrecover adverse conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed literaturesearching through different databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, Google Scholar). We used different keywords, including micronutrients, COCs, side effects, B vitamins,vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin D, zinc, magnesium, selenium and Centella Asiatica.We narrowed the search down to English literature, including both preclinical andclinical studies. The outcome of database search was to highlight beneficialeffects of specific micronutrients on the evaluated side reactions. RESULTS:Based on the collected evidence, dietary supplementations of specificmicronutrients, whose depletion occurs during COC treatments, have significantbeneficial effects. By acting on different aspects and pathways, suchsupplementation prevents and counteracts discomforts and side effects related to COC treatments. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the wide use of OCs, taking appropriate dietary supplements could be an effective approach in clinical practice,tailoring therapies and improving both safety and tolerability.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at comparing sperm parameters and hormonal levelswith L-carnitine vs. CoQ10 and Vitamin E therapy for patients withasthenozoospermia and teratozoospermia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A single-blindrandomized controlled trial (RCT) was designed wherein patients were randomlyallocated to receive L-carnitine complex nutrient treatment (study group - 15g/bag, orally one bag at a time, twice a day) or CoQ10 (control group - 10 mgtablet orally, thrice daily) with Vitamin E (100 mg tablet orally, thrice daily) for three months. Outcome variables were sperm concentration, progressive spermmotility, normal sperm morphology, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone,luteinizing hormone (LH), and prolactin levels. RESULTS: 143 patients wereanalyzed (73 in study and 70 in control group). Compared to baseline, spermcount, progressive sperm motility, and morphology improved significantly in thestudy group, but only progressive sperm motility and morphology improved in thecontrol group. Serum testosterone levels significantly increased both in thestudy and control groups, while LH increased only in the study but not in thecontrol group. All sperm parameters showed significantly better improvement inthe study group, compared to the control group. Testosterone and LH levels werealso higher in the study group compared to the control group. CONCLUSIONS:L-carnitine significantly improves sperm motility, morphology, and concentration,while also improving testosterone and LH levels. Use of CoQ10 and Vitamin Eresulted in improvement of only sperm motility, morphology, and testosteronelevels. L-carnitine was found to be superior to the combination of CoQ10 andVitamin E in improving sperm parameters. Further studies examining clinicalpregnancy rates are needed to strengthen the evidence.

AB  - The escalation of cancer cases globally, especially breast cancer, is of concern.Angiogenesis is hallmark of cancer pathogenesis and plays an important role incancer progression and metastasis. Pro-angiogenic agents, secreted by tumorcells, form new blood vessels, and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROSpromote angiogenesis via two major pathways: namely Vascular Endothelial GrowthFactor (VEGF) dependent and non-VEGF dependent pathways. As a consequence ofunbalanced ROS overproduction and low antioxidants levels, oxidative stressoccurs and promotes angiogenesis in breast cancer tissues. Thus, the potentialuse of antioxidants as a preventive therapy in breast cancer. Preclinical studiesdepict that vitamins A and E may counter oxidative stress resulting in reduction of metastasis and viability of breast cancer. Furthermore, clinical studiesdemonstrate a decline in breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women upon theconsumption of antioxidants. Herein, we discuss various pro-angiogenic agentsthat may play an important role in breast cancer angiogenesis. Moreover, thecontribution of oxidative stress in inducing the angiogenic process isextensively reviewed here. Furthermore, the findings of pre-clinical and clinicalstudies on the use of antioxidants, namely vitamins A and E, in breast cancer aredeliberated upon, along with the role of angiogenesis in cancer therapy.

AB  - Scurvy is a rare disease in developed countries and few cases have been reported in adults within the last years. We aimed to report and discuss a case of a35-year-old male with a medical history of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) whoinitially presented to the emergency department with complaints of right legpain, swelling, and weakness. Physical exam revealed low degree fever associated with right knee and ankle ecchymosis and edema, in addition to a well healinglaceration on the anterior tibia with hyperpigmentation. Laboratory resultsshowed elevated inflammatory markers. Due to the high suspicion of bone or softtissue infection, antibiotic treatment was started without improvement. Uponreassessment and closer inspection of the skin, the patient was noted to havefollicular hyperkeratosis and perifollicular hemorrhage; that in combination witha restrictive diet due to IBS, raised the suspicion of scurvy. Vitamin C levelswere.

TI  - Exercise training and NR supplementation to improve muscle mass and fitness inadolescent and young adult hematopoietic cell transplant survivors: a randomized controlled trial {1}.
PG  - 795
LID - 10.1186/s12885-022-09845-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have led tomarked improvements in survival. However, adolescents and young adults (AYAs) whoundergo HCT are at high risk of developing sarcopenia (loss of skeletal musclemass) due to the impact of HCT-related exposures on the developingmusculoskeletal system. HCT survivors who have sarcopenia also have excesslifetime risk of non-relapse mortality. Therefore, interventions that increaseskeletal muscle mass, metabolism, strength, and function are needed to improvehealth in AYA HCT survivors. Skeletal muscle is highly reliant on mitochondrialenergy production, as reflected by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) capacity.Exercise is one approach to target skeletal muscle mitochondrial OXPHOS, and inturn improve muscle function and strength. Another approach is to use "exerciseenhancers", such as nicotinamide riboside (NR), a safe and well-toleratedprecursor of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)), a cofactor that in turn impacts muscle energy production. Interventions combining exercise with exercise enhancers like NR hold promise, but have not yet been rigorously tested in AYAHCT survivors. METHODS/DESIGN: We will perform a randomized controlled trialtesting 16 weeks of in-home aerobic and resistance exercise and NR in AYA HCTsurvivors, with a primary outcome of muscle strength via dynamometry and a keysecondary outcome of cardiovascular fitness via cardiopulmonary exercise testing.We will also test the effects of these interventions on i) muscle mass via dualenergy x-ray absorptiometry; ii) muscle mitochondrial OXPHOS via an innovativenon-invasive MRI-based technique, and iii) circulating correlates of NAD(+)metabolism via metabolomics. Eighty AYAs (ages 15-30y) will be recruited 6-24months post-HCT and randomized to 1 of 4 arms: exercise + NR, exercise alone, NR alone, or control. Outcomes will be collected at baseline and after the 16-weekintervention. DISCUSSION: We expect that exercise with NR will produce largerchanges than exercise alone in key outcomes, and that changes will be mediated byincreases in muscle OXPHOS. We will apply the insights gained from this trial to develop individualized, evidence-supported precision initiatives that will reducechronic disease burden in high-risk cancer survivors.

TI  - Planning is not equivalent to preparing, how Dutch women perceive their pregnancyplanning in relation to preconceptional lifestyle behaviour change - across-sectional study.
PG  - 577
LID - 10.1186/s12884-022-04843-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unhealthy prenatal lifestyle behaviours are associated with adversepregnancy outcomes, but little is known about what motivates women to comply withpreconceptional lifestyle recommendations or consciously plan their pregnancy.Therefore, the objective of this study is to explore the associations betweenpreconceptional lifestyle behaviours, health beliefs and pregnancy planning amongDutch pregnant women. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study based on the data ofthe APROPOS-II study, 1,077 low-risk pregnant women were eligible for inclusion. Preconception lifestyle behaviours and actively preparing for pregnancy wereassessed in relation to planned pregnancies (based on the London Measure ofUnplanned Pregnancies) and health beliefs (14 statements). The followingpreconceptional lifestyle behaviours were assessed through a self-administeredquestionnaire in the first trimester of pregnancy: fruit intake, vegetableintake, caffeine intake, (second-hand)smoking, alcohol intake, folic acidsupplement use and exercise. Data were analysed using multivariate logisticregression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 921 (85.5%) women in our cohort had aplanned pregnancy. However, of these women, 640 (69.5%) adequately used folicacid supplements and 465 (50.5%) women consumed alcohol at any point duringpregnancy. Of the women considering themselves 'healthy enough and not needingpreconception care', 48 (9.1%) women had an adequate vegetable intake, 294(55.6%) women consumed alcohol at any point during pregnancy and 161 (30.4%)women were either over-or underweight. CONCLUSION: Despite consciously planningtheir pregnancy, most women did not adhere to preconceptional lifestyle behaviourrecommendations. Women's health beliefs and overestimation of their health statusseem to interfere with actively planning and preparing for pregnancy. Findingsfrom our study may encourage the development of prospective health-promotinginterventions that focus on health beliefs and actively preparing for pregnancy, to improve preconceptional lifestyle behaviours, thereby optimizing the health offuture generations.

TI  - Vitamin C and folate status in hereditary fructose intolerance.
LID - 10.1038/s41430-022-01178-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) is a rare inborn error offructose metabolism caused by the deficiency of aldolase B. Since treatmentconsists of a fructose-, sucrose- and sorbitol-restrictive diet for life,patients are at risk of presenting vitamin deficiencies. Although there is nopublished data on the status of these vitamins in HFI patients, supplementationwith vitamin C and folic acid is common. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess vitamin C and folate status and supplementation practices in a nationwide cohort of HFI patients. METHODS: Vitamin C and folic acid dietary intake,supplementation and circulating levels were assessed in 32 HFI patients and 32age- and sex-matched healthy controls. RESULTS: Most of the HFI participantspresented vitamin C (96.7%) and folate (90%) dietary intake below the recommendedpopulation reference intake. Up to 69% received vitamin C and 50% folic acidsupplementation. Among HFI patients, 15.6% presented vitamin C and 3.1% folatedeficiency. The amount of vitamin C supplementation and plasma levels correlated positively (R = 0.443; p = 0.011). Interestingly, a higher percentage ofnon-supplemented HFI patients were vitamin C deficient when compared tosupplemented HFI patients (30% vs. 9.1%; p = 0.01) and to healthy controls (30%vs. 3.1%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence for the firsttime supporting vitamin C supplementation in HFI. There is great heterogeneity invitamin supplementation practices and, despite follow-up at specialised centres, vitamin C deficiency is common. Further research is warranted to establishoptimal doses of vitamin C and the need for folic acid supplementation in HFI.

TI  - A randomised, prospective and head-to-head comparison of [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and[18F]PSMA-1007 for the detection of recurrent prostate cancer in PSMA-ligandPET/CT-Protocol design and rationale.
PG  - e0270269
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270269 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A number of radiopharmaceuticals are available for the detection ofrecurrent prostate cancer (rPC), but few comparative imaging trials have beenperformed comparing them. In particular, there are no prospective head-to-headcomparisons of the recently introduced [18F]PSMA-1007 to the existing standard ofcare [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11. The purpose of this trial is to establish thenon-inferiority of the new radiopharmaceutical in terms of the rate ofPET-positive findings and to obtain an intra-individual comparison of accuracyand radiopharmaceutical kinetics. METHODS: In this cross-over trial we willrandomise 100 individuals to receive either first a standard-of-care PET/CT using[68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 followed by an additional [18F]PSMA-1007 PET/CT within 2 weeks, or vice-versa. Inclusion criteria include patients 18 years and older withbiochemical recurrence of prostate cancer following radical prostatectomy,defined as two consecutive prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels > 0.2 ng/ml.Detection rate at the patient-based level is the primary end-point. Each scanwill be interpreted by a panel of six independent and masked readers (three for[68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and three for [18F]PSMA-1007) which consensus majority in cases of discrepancy. To confirm the PET-positivity rate at a patient based level,follow up at 6 months following the first scan will be performed to a compositestandard of truth. Secondary endpoints shall include an intra-individualcomparison of radiopharmaceutical-kinetics, per-region detection rate andpositive predictive value. DISCUSSION: This is the first randomised prospectivecomparative imaging trial to compare the established [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 with[18F]PSMA-1007 and will determine whether the new radiopharmaceutical isnon-inferior to the established standard-of-care in terms of patient-leveldetection rate. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered with and approved by the regional ethics authority #2020-02903 (submitted 09.12.2020, approval 16.12.2021)and the regulatory authority SwissMedic 2020DR2103.

AB  - Fermented beverages based on kombucha contain a wide range of minor biologically active substances (flavonoids, caffeic acid derivatives, B vitamins, and others).The inclusion of these beverages in the diet helps to increase its nutritionalvalue due to the content of biologically active substances, including essentialones. To develop beverages (kombucha) with a certain content of biologicallyactive substances, it is necessary to study the composition of these productssold on the Russian market. The aim of the work was to analyze the Russian marketof fermented beverages based on kombucha. Material and methods. More than 100different marketed products were selected, positioned as non-alcoholic fermented beverages based on kombucha. Results. It was revealed that black tea (~28%),green tea (~24%) and Blooming Sally (~13%) are most often used as the basis forkombucha. In other cases, various types of tea, coffee, as well as specialvarieties of tea are used. Sugar (~55%), stevia extract (~24%), as well as honey,fructose, glucose-fructose syrup are used as sweeteners. The formation of theflavor profile of kombucha is achieved by using additional ingredients. A varietyof fruits (lemon, orange, mango, apple, etc.), vegetables (cucumber, beetroot,etc.), berries (cranberries, lingonberries, chokeberry, raspberries, etc.) areused in the form of juices or purees; herbs and spices (mint, nutmeg, star anise,cloves, lavender, vanilla, etc.), as well as functional ingredients (vitamins,prebiotics, probiotics, chlorophyll) are applied as such additives. Conclusion.The analysis of the range of fermented drinks (kombucha) marketed in tradingnetwork was carried out. A list of main and auxiliary ingredients has been formedto assess the possibility of using these drinks to modify eating patterns.

AB  - The concept of social jetlag refers to asynchronous communication of a person'sbiological clock with tempo of modern living, which occurs mainly as a result of intensive work. At the core of social jetlag is sleep deprivation or chronicsleep restriction caused by social factors: pervasive use of electronic solutionsand networks, intensive round the clock operation, chronic diseases. The aim ofthe work was to determine vitamins, minerals, and other micronutrients, theavailability of which is important for supporting the organism in case ofcircadian rhythm sleep disorders and sleep restrictions, the so-called socialjetlag. Material and methods. The analysis of 78 sources from PubMed and GoogleScholar bibliographic bases was carried out with a detailed analysis of data fromthe published studies. Results. Circadian rhythm sleep disorders and sleeprestrictions affects cognitive functions, increasing risk of anxiety anddepressive disorders, enhances processes of chronic inflammation, oxidativestress, cardiometabolic disorders. Scientific evidence has been collected thatlack of such elements as magnesium, folates, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and probiotics in diet can worsening effects of social jetlag and increase therisk of chronic diseases. Preventive course intake of this micronutrients isreasonable in people predisposed to social jetlag. Conclusion. In risk groups of people predisposed to social jetlag, along with diverse diet and adequatenutrition, sleep hygiene, it is necessary to provide targeted supplementationwith magnesium, folates, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and probioticproducts.

TI  - Calcium Determines Lactiplantibacillus plantarum Intraspecies CompetitiveFitness.
PG  - e0066622
LID - 10.1128/aem.00666-22 [doi]
AB  - The importance of individual nutrients for microbial strain robustness andcoexistence in habitats containing different members of the same species is notwell understood. To address this for Lactiplantibacillus plantarum in foodfermentations, we performed comparative genomics and examined the nutritiverequirements and competitive fitness for L. plantarum strains B1.1 and B1.3isolated from a single sample of teff injera fermentation batter. Compared toB1.1 and other L. plantarum strains, B1.3 has a smaller genome, limitedbiosynthetic capacities, and large mobilome. Despite these differences, B1.3 was equally competitive with B1.1 in a suspension of teff flour. In commerciallysourced, nutrient-replete MRS (cMRS) medium, strain B1.3 reached 3-fold-highernumbers than B1.1 within 2 days of passage. Because B1.3 growth and competitivefitness were poor in mMRS medium (here called mMRS), a modified MRS mediumlacking beef extract, we used mMRS to identify nutrients needed for robust B1.3growth. No improvement was observed when mMRS was supplemented with nucleotides, amino acids, vitamins, or monovalent metals. Remarkably, the addition of divalentmetal salts increased the growth rate and cell yields of B1.3 in mMRS. Metalrequirements were confirmed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry,showing that total B1.3 intracellular metal concentrations were significantly (upto 2.7-fold) reduced compared to B1.1. Supplemental CaCl2 conferred the greatest effect, resulting in equal growth between B1.1 and B1.3 over five successivepassages in mMRS. Moreover, calcium supplementation reversed a B1.3strain-specific, stationary-phase, flocculation phenotype. These findings showhow L. plantarum calcium requirements affect competitive fitness at the strainlevel. IMPORTANCE Ecological theory states that the struggle for existence isstronger between closely related species. Contrary to this assertion, fermentedfoods frequently sustain conspecific individuals, in spite of their high levelsof phylogenetic relatedness. Therefore, we investigated two isolates ofLactiplantibacillus plantarum, B1.1 and B1.3, randomly selected from a singlebatch of teff injera batter. These strains spanned the known genomic andphenotypic range of the L. plantarum species, and in laboratory culture mediumused for strain screening, B1.3 exhibited poor growth and was outcompeted by the more robust strain B1.1. Nonetheless, B1.1 and B1.3 were equally competitive inteff flour. This result shows how L. plantarum has adapted for coexistence inthat environment. The capacity for the single macronutrient calcium to restoreB1.3 competitive fitness in laboratory culture medium suggests that L. plantarum intraspecies diversity found in food systems is fine-tuned to nutrientrequirements at the strain level.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine the relationship between low vitamin Dlevels and lateral epicondylitis (LE). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2016and January 2018, a total of 40 patients (17 males, 23 females; mean age:38.6+/-10.7 years; range, 18 to 59 years) diagnosed with LE were included as the study group, while 66 patients (33 males, 33 females; mean age: 33.6+/-12.5years; range, 18 to 58 years) who did not have any elbow complaints and met thestudy criteria were included as the control group. Both groups were compared interms of vitamin D levels, of which levels of >30 ng/mL were considered normal,levels between 20-30 ng/mL were accepted as vitamin D insufficiency, and levels<20 ng/mL were categorized as vitamin D deficiency. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels of the LE group were significantly lower than the control group (p<0.001). The mean vitamin D level was 16.47+/-8.22 (range, 8.32 to 39.55) ng/mL in the LE group,and 23.64+/-8.4 (range, 11.6 to 49) ng/mL in the control group. While 31 of thepatients (77.5%) diagnosed with LE had vitamin D deficiency, four (10%) hadvitamin D insufficiency, and five (12.5%) had normal vitamin D levels. In thecontrol group, 29 (43.9%) patients had vitamin D deficiency, 20 (30.3%) hadvitamin D insufficiency, and 17 (25.8%) had normal vitamin D levels. CONCLUSION: Although the etiology of LE has not been fully understood yet, vitamin D levelswere significantly lower in LE patients in our study. This finding supports that low vitamin D may be one of the factors in the etiology of LE.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vitamins B6 and B12 are involved in metabolic processes that decrease neural excitation and increase inhibition. This double-blind study investigatedthe effects of supplementation for 1 month with a high-dose of B6 or B12,compared to placebo, on a range of behavioural outcome measures connected to the balance between neural inhibition and excitation. METHODS: 478 young adults were recruited over five linked phases. Self-reported anxiety (N = 265) and depression(N = 146) were assessed at baseline and after supplementation. Several sensorymeasures acted as assays of inhibitory function and were assessedpost-supplementation only; these were surround suppression of visual contrastdetection (N = 307), binocular rivalry reversal rate (N = 172), and a battery of tactile sensitivity tests (N = 180). RESULTS: Vitamin B6 supplementation reduced self-reported anxiety and induced a trend towards reduced depression, as well as increased surround suppression of visual contrast detection, but did not reliablyinfluence the other outcome measures. Vitamin B12 supplementation produced trendstowards changes in anxiety and visual processing. CONCLUSIONS: Our resultssuggest that high-dose Vitamin B6 supplementation increases inhibitory GABAergic neural influences, which is consistent with its known role in the synthesis ofGABA.

TI  - Effects of Vitamin E Supplementation to Metabolic Markers on Diet-Induced Obesityin Mice.
PG  - 895-900
LID - 10.3897/folmed.63.e57877 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity creates health problems by increasing the risks of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disorders. Obesity leads toinsulin resistance, higher blood glucose and cholesterol levels. Adipose tissues synthesize adiponectin which acts as anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, andanti-atherogenic agent. Meanwhile, vitamin E is an antioxidant that acts as ananti-inflammation. AIM: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects ofvitamin E supplementation to metabolic markers on diet-induced obesity in mice.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four mice (Mus musculus, L) aged four weeks weredivided into six groups which were fed different diets and given vitamin E indifferent dosages or methods. The period of treatment was 18 weeks. The mice bodyweights were measured every week; blood sugar and cholesterol levels weremeasured every six weeks, and the adiponectin level measurement was done at week 18. RESULTS: A repeated measures ANOVA showed that body weight and cholesterollevel within groups were not significantly different [F(15, 54)=1.417, 0.173 and F(10, 36)=1.391, 0.224 respectively]. The glucose levels were found to besignificantly different [F(7.646, 27.526)=2.625, 0.030]. There was no significantdifference in the adiponectin levels. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin E supplementationcould not prevent the increase of body weight, the elevation of blood sugar andcholesterol levels, and also could not increase adiponectin level.

AB  - In this study, we describe a Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, non-motile andaerobic bacterium, named strain MT3330(T), which was isolated from the deep-seasediment of the Mariana Trench. Growth of MT3330(T) occurred at 15-40 degrees C(optimum, 25-30 degrees C), pH 5.0-10.0 (optimum, 7.0-8.0) and with 0-8.0 % (w/v)NaCl (optimum, 0-2.0 %). The results of phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNAgene sequence indicated that MT3330(T) represented a member of the familyFlavobacteriaceae and was most closely related to Zhouia spongiae HN-Y44(T) (92.3% sequence similarity). The results of genomic analysis indicated that MT3330(T) contains a circular chromosome of 4 365 036 bp with a DNA G+C content of 35.2 %. The predominant respiratory quinone of MT3330(T) was MK-6. The polar lipids ofMT3330(T) included phosphatidylethanolamine, three unidentified amino lipids and four unidentified lipids. The major fatty acids of MT3330(T) included C15 : 0,iso-C15 : 1G, iso-C15 : 0 3-OH, and iso-C17 : 0 3-OH. On the basis of the resultsof the phylogenetic, physiological, biochemical and morphological analyses, it issuggested that strain MT3330(T) represents a novel genus and a novel species ofthe family Flavobacteriaceae, and the name Abyssalbus ytuae gen. nov., sp. nov.is proposed. The type strain is MT3330(T) (=MCCC 1K06012(T)=KCTC 82823(T)).

AB  - Baitouweng Decoction is a famous Chinese medicinal decoction that has been usedto treat diarrhea over thousands of years. In this study, we investigated theeffect and mechanism of Baitouweng Decoction in the treatment of diarrhea. Wistarrats were randomly assigned into 4 groups: control group, dampness-heat diarrhea model group(modeling by complex factors including high-sugar and high-fat diet,improper diet, hot and humid environment, drinking and intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli), Baitouweng Decoction(3.6 g.kg~(-1)) group, and self-healinggroup. A urine metabolomics approach was developed with ultra liquidchromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight-mass spectrometry(UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) formetabolic profiling. The differential metabolites were screened out by themultivariate comparison between groups. Diarrhea-related protein targets and the active compounds of Baitouweng Decoction were used to predict the protein targetsof Baitouweng Decoction. Cytoscape 3.2.1 was employed to establish a activecomponent-target protein interaction network. Three protein-proteininteraction(PPI) networks of component target proteins, diarrhea-relatedproteins, and differential metabolite-related proteins were established and then merged by BisoGenet. ClueGO was used to perform the gene enrichment based on the genetic similarity. The results showed that Baitouweng Decoction effectivelytreated dampness-heat diarrhea in vivo. N-acetylserotonin,L-gamma-glutamylcysteine, glutathione, retinoate, melatonin,indole-3-acetaldehyde, L-cystine, biotin, and L-tryptophan were screened asdifferential metabolites in dampness-heat diarrhea model group. Tryptophanmetabolism, glutathione metabolism, biotin metabolism, retinol metabolism, andcysteine and methionine metabolism were involved in the therapeutic effect ofBaitouweng Decoction in vivo. A total of 167 targets were identified as majorcandidates for diarrhea progression. The gene-set enrichment revealed that thetargets were involved in reactive oxygen species production, inflammation, andapoptosis. Baitouweng Decoction can restrain inflammation, production of reactiveoxygen, and block apoptosis, thereby contributing to the treatment ofdampness-heat diarrhea.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the effects of vitamin C on central retinal thickness and choroidal thickness. METHODS: A total of 69 patients diagnosed with vitamin Cdeficiency and 1:1 age- and gender-matched 69 healthy individuals with normalserum vitamin C were included in this study. Demographic characteristics of theindividuals were collected. All patients underwent a comprehensive ophthalmicexamination. Subfoveal choroidal thickness and retinal thickness were measuredusing a swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). RESULTS: The average retinal thickness was 269.07 +/- 13.51 mum in the vitamin C deficiency group and 276.92 +/- 13.51 mum in the control group. The average choroidal thickness was195.62 +/- 66.40 mum in the in the vitamin C deficiency group and 238.86 +/-55.08 mum in the control group. There was a significant decrease in both average choroidal thickness and retinal thickness in vitamin C deficiency group compared with normal individuals (p < 0.001, and = 0.001 respectively). CONCLUSION: Thecentral retinal and choroidal thickness were thinner in vitamin C deficiencygroup compared with normal individuals. These findings suggested that vitamin Cdeficiency might play an important role in retinal and choroidal diseases.

TI  - Drug repurposing based on a quantum-inspired method versus classicalfingerprinting uncovers potential antivirals against SARS-CoV-2.
PG  - e1010330
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010330 [doi]
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need to identify new antiviraltherapeutics at pace, including through drug repurposing. We employed a QuadraticUnbounded Binary Optimization (QUBO) model, to search for compounds similar toRemdesivir, the first antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 approved for human use, using a quantum-inspired device. We modelled Remdesivir and compounds present in theDrugBank database as graphs, established the optimal parameters in our algorithm and resolved the Maximum Weighted Independent Set problem within the conflictgraph generated. We also employed a traditional Tanimoto fingerprint model. Thetwo methods yielded different lists of lead compounds, with some overlap. WhileGS-6620 was the top compound predicted by both models, the QUBO model predictedBMS-986094 as second best. The Tanimoto model predicted different forms ofcobalamin, also known as vitamin B12. We then determined the half maximalinhibitory concentration (IC50) values in cell culture models of SARS-CoV-2infection and assessed cytotoxicity. We also demonstrated efficacy againstseveral variants including SARS-CoV-2 Strain England 2 (England 02/2020/407073), B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). Lastly, we employed an in vitro polymerization assay to demonstrate that these compounds directly inhibitthe RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) of SARS-CoV-2. Together, our data reveal that our QUBO model performs accurate comparisons (BMS-986094) that differed fromthose predicted by Tanimoto (different forms of vitamin B12); all compoundsinhibited replication of SARS-CoV-2 via direct action on RdRP, with both modelsbeing useful. While Tanimoto may be employed when performing relatively smallcomparisons, QUBO is also accurate and may be well suited for very complexproblems where computational resources may limit the number and/or complexity of possible combinations to evaluate. Our quantum-inspired screening method cantherefore be employed in future searches for novel pharmacologic inhibitors, thusproviding an approach for accelerating drug deployment.

AB  - Histone acetyltransferases (HATs, also known as lysine acetyltransferases, KATs) catalyze acetylation of their cognate protein substrates using acetyl-CoA(Ac-CoA) as a cofactor and are involved in various physiological and pathologicalprocesses. Advances in mass spectrometry-based proteomics have allowed thediscovery of thousands of acetylated proteins and the specific acetylated lysine sites. However, due to the rapid dynamics and functional redundancy of HATactivities, and the limitation of using antibodies to capture acetylated lysines,it is challenging to systematically and precisely define both the substrates and sites directly acetylated by a given HAT. Here, we describe a chemoproteomicapproach to identify and profile protein substrates of individual HAT enzymes on the proteomic scale. The approach involves protein engineering to enlarge theAc-CoA binding pocket of the HAT of interest, such that a mutant form isgenerated that can use functionalized acyl-CoAs as a cofactor surrogate tobioorthogonally label its protein substrates. The acylated protein substrates canthen be chemoselectively conjugated either with a fluorescent probe (for imaging detection) or with a biotin handle (for streptavidin pulldown and chemoproteomic identification). This modular chemical biology approach has been successfullyimplemented to identify protein substrates of p300, GCN5, and HAT1, and it isexpected that this method can be applied to profile and identify thesub-acetylomes of many other HAT enzymes.

AB  - Introduction: Heart Failure is a leading cause of mortality worldwide includingIndia. Most cross sectional studies have demonstrated heart failure is associatedwith deficiency of essential micronutrients including Vitamin D which may play a important role in pathogenesis of ventricular remodelling in heart failure. Aim: Our study performed aimed to determine the effect of supplementation in patients of Heart Failure presenting with Vitamin D deficiency to our institute onseverity of Heart Failure. Design and Method: 97 patients of Heart failure comingto our institute were given conventional therapies for Heart Failure along withVitamin supplementation based on serum Vitamin D levels and followed up for 3months. Results: Patient of Heart failure having Vitamin D deficiency hadsignificant reduction in cardiac biomarkers (NT-pro BNP levels), improvement inLeft ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and more favourable reverse remodellingdetermined by Left ventricular end diastolic and systolic diameter (LVEDD &LVESD) though quality of life determined by WHODAS 2.0 score did not changedfollowing 12 weeks supplementation of High Dose Vitamin D. Conclusion:Recognising and treatment of Vitamin D deficiency may determine long termprognosis in patients of Heart Failure.

TI  - Effect of CoQ10 Administration to Psoriatic Iraqi Patients on Biological Therapy Upon Severity Index (PASI) and Quality of Life Index (DLQI) Before and AfterTherapy.
PG  - e52-e60

AB  - Psoriasis is a medical condition in which the skin of the body is affected at amultisytemic level. Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis have aconsiderably reduced quality of life as a result of their disease. Formorphological indicators, the Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) test is one ofthe methods for indicating the severity of the illness. An imbalance betweenpro-oxidants and antioxidants in our bodies causes oxidative stress and plays acrucial role in the pathophysiology of chronic inflammatory diseases likepsoriasis(1). It has been considered that antioxidant treatment can be aneffective therapeutic option. The goal of this clinical investigation was to see if there was a link between the percentage change in quality of life and theclinical severity of psoriasis during a 12-week period among Iraqi psoriaticpatients. Over the course of 3 months, 24 psoriatic patients (9 females and 15males) ranging in age from 17 to 72 years participated in a prospectivedouble-blinded clinical experiment. Two groups of participants were formed. Abiological medicine (adalimumab) and a placebo was given to group A (n = 11),whereas group B (n = 13) received 100 mg CoQ10 adjuvant therapy in addition tothe biological medication already provided. The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index(PASI) and the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were used to examinepatients (DLQI). Treatment with both biological and adjuvant CoQ10 therapy showeda substantial association between the PASI and the DLQI (p = 0.000132). After 3months of therapy, the mean (SD) of the PASI score for all patients was 20.887.15, with a 67.48% +/- 22.25% improvement change. The mean SD of the DLQI score at baseline was 12.5 +/- 4.71, with a change of 56.13% +/- 20.15% followingtreatment. After therapy with a biological medication, there was a favorableassociation between the PASI and the DLQI (p > 0.05). This indicates that therapywith a biological medication with daily administration of 100 mg CoQ10supplements to psoriatic patients for 12 weeks improved the correlation betweenPASI and DLQI.

AB  - Objectives: Growing evidence demonstrated that vitamin D levels had been linkedto type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in light ofvarious extraskeletal effects. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate theassociation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] level with the clinicopathologicalfeatures and CKD progression in T2DM. Methods: A total of 182 patients with T2DM with CKD stages 1 through 4 (G1-G4) were retrospectively included. Identificationof the serum 25(OH)D level associated with CKD progression was executed byKaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models. We furtherperformed sensitivity analyses with a time-weighted average (TWA) of the serum25(OH)D level in 75 participants to reinforce the findings. Results: The medianserum 25(OH)D level was 26 (IQR, 14; 39) nmol/L in the study participants. Medianfollow-up time was 42 months, during which 70 (38%) patients confronted CKDprogression. Cumulative kidney outcomes were significantly higher in the lowesttertile of the serum 25(OH)D level in Kaplan-Meier analyses (P < 0.001).Consistently, the analyses of Cox proportional hazards regression modelsindicated a significantly greater risk for CKD progression in the lowest tertile of the serum 25(OH)D level compared with the highest tertile of the serum 25(OH)Dlevel (P = 0.03). These relationships remained robust with further sensitivityanalysis of data with TWA of the serum 25(OH)D level, showing an independentassociation between lower TWA of the serum 25(OH)D level and an unfavorable renaloutcome in patients with T2DM with CKD. Conclusions: Our findings demonstratedthat patients with T2DM with a decreased 25(OH)D level had deteriorated renalfunction. Both lower levels of baseline and TWA of serum 25(OH)D were associated with an increased risk of CKD progression in patients with T2DM, which suggested that the long-term maintenance of optimal vitamin D levels from early in lifemight be associated with reduced future risk of CKD development in T2DM.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to explore the relationship between homocysteine(Hcy) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) and the impacts of the Hcy pathway on thisrelationship against this background. Methods: This study retrieved 1979 patientswith type 2 diabetes (T2D) from the First Affiliated Hospital of Liaoning MedicalUniversity in Jinzhou, Liaoning Province, China. Multiple logistic regression wasused to analyze the effects of Hcy cycle on the relationship between Hcy and DR. Spearman's rank correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between risk factors related to DR progression and Hcy. Finally, the results of logistic regression were supplemented by mediation analysis. Results: We found there was anegative correlation between low concentration of Hcy and DR (OR : 0.83, 95%CI:0.69-1). After stratifying all patients by cysteine (Cys) or Methionine (Met),this relationship remained significant only in low concentration of Cys (OR:0.75, 95%CI: 0.61-0.94). Through the RCS curve, we found that the effect of Hcyon DR presents a U-shaped curve relationship. Mediating effect in Met and Hcycycles was also significant [Total effect c (OR: 0.968, 95%CI: 0.938-0.998),Direct effect path c' (OR: 0.969, 95%CI: 0.940-0.999), Path a (OR: 1.047, 95%CI: 1.004-1.091), Path b (OR: 0.964, 95%CI: 0.932-0.998)]. Conclusions: Therelationship between Hcy and DR presents a U-shaped curve and the homocysteinecycle pathway has an impact on it. And too low concentration of Hcy indicates alack of other substances, such as vitamins. It is suggested that the progression of DR is the result of a combination of many risk factors. Further prospectivestudies are needed to determine the role of Hcy in the pathogenesis of DR.

PG  - 4006184
LID - 10.1155/2022/4006184 [doi]
AB  - Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a disorder that can cause collapse ofthe femoral head. The damage and dysfunction of femoral head microvascularendothelial cells are related to the pathogenesis of glucocorticoid-induced ONFH.Reports suggest that vitamin B2 can promote osteoblast differentiation andprevent low bone mineral density and prevent reperfusion oxidative injury. Toexplore the effect and possible molecular mechanism of vitamin B2 on the ONFH andHuman Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (HUVECs), we performed a rat model of ONFHby dexamethasone. The rats were randomly divided into four groups: control group,vitamin B2 group, dexamethasone group, and dexamethasone combined with vitamin B2treatment group. HUVECs were used to further prove the role and mechanism ofvitamin B2 in vitro. In patients, according to immunohistochemical and qRT-PCR ofthe femoral head, the angiogenic capacity of the ONFH femoral head iscompromised. In vivo, it showed that vitamin B2 could inhibitglucocorticoid-induced ONFH-like changes in rats by suppressing cell apoptosis,promoting the regeneration of blood vessels, and increasing bone mass. According to in vitro results, vitamin B2 could induce the migration of HUVECs, enhance theexpression of angiogenesis-related factors, and inhibit glucocorticoid-inducedapoptosis. The underlying mechanism may be that vitamin B2 activates the PI3Ksignaling pathway. Vitamin B2 alleviated dexamethasone-induced ONFH, and vitamin B2 could promote the proliferation and migration of HUVECs and inhibit theirapoptosis by activating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Vitamin B2 may be apotentially effective treatment for ONFH.

AB  - To investigate the pharmacodynamic effects of ruscogenin on acute kidney injuryand the Rev-erbalpha/beta regulation of ferroptosis intervention mechanism. TheC57BL-6 mice were induced acute kidney injury with folic acid. Plasma, urine, andkidney samples were collected after intraperitoneal injection of ruscogenin(0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/kg). We measured mouse kidney function indicators, includingcreatinine (CRE), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosidase (NAG),albumin, albumin and creatinine rate (ACR), renal index, and renal injurymolecule-1 expression. Meanwhile, we detected the levels of ferroptosisindicators malondialdehyde (MDA), carbonylated proteins, iron ions, glutathioneperoxidase 4 (GPX-4), and glutathione (GSH). The expression of solute carrierfamily 7 member 11 (Slc7a11), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and Rev-erbalpha/beta weredetected by the Western blot and quantitative reverse transcription polymerasechain reaction (qRT-PCR), respectively. Ruscogenin (1 mg/kg) significantlyreduced the index of folic acid-induced acute kidney injury and alleviated acute kidney injury. In kidney tissues, ruscogenin inhibited folic acid-inducedRev-erbalpha/beta expression, restored HO-1 and SLC7A11 expression to normallevels, and alleviated ferroptosis. Ruscogenin ameliorates acute kidney injuryvia suppressing ferroptosis in kidney tissues through modulation of theRev-erbalpha/beta-SLC7A11/HO-1 pathway.

PG  - 906592
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.906592 [doi]
AB  - The pseudocereal grain, Quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.), has a greatnutritional value due to its high contents of proteins, fiber, minerals, andvitamins. However, saponins naturally present outside the grains represent anobstacle to their consumption as human food. Before consumption, the grains aresubjected to various treatments, which alter their nutritional value. In anattempt to eliminate the maximum of saponins using the wet process, whileminimizing the washing conditions and preserving the nutritional quality, weexplored the effects of several parameters, including volume of water, treatment time, soaking time, number of washing, and water temperature, followed by anoptimization process using Box-Behnken Design, and finally, the impact of thisprocess on the physicochemical and techno-functional properties of six quinoagenotypes seeds was evaluated. As a result, the variation of the treatment time, volume, and temperature of the water positively affected the saponins leaching.According to the quadratic model, the maximum percentages of eliminated saponins (96.53%-96.77%) were found at a temperature of 50 degrees C, treatment times from60 to 69 min, and water volumes from 6.99 to 7.50 mL per gram of seeds. Theoptimized method did not affect the proteins and microelements content (Zn, Mn,B, Mo), while a slight decrease of macro-elements (K, P, Ca, S, Mg) was noted in the level of some genotypes. On the other hand, a significant improvement of the techno-functional properties such as water and oil holding capacity was noted,with a sharp drop-in emulsifying activity in all genotypes without affecting the standard values of pH (6.4-6.8) and moisture content (10%-11%) of the seeds.Hence, the optimized method showed to be a more potential method for saponinsremoval than the currently used dry method.

PG  - 935465
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.935465 [doi]
AB  - Memory T cells play an essential role in infectious and tumor immunity. Vitamin Ametabolites such as retinoic acid are immune modulators, but the role of vitamin A metabolism in memory T-cell differentiation is unclear. In this study, weidentified retinol dehydrogenase 10 (Rdh10), which metabolizes vitamin A toretinal (RAL), as a key molecule for regulating T cell differentiation. Tcell-specific Rdh10 deficiency enhanced memory T-cell formation through blocking RAL production in infection model. Epigenetic profiling revealed that retinoicacid receptor (RAR) signaling activated by vitamin A metabolites inducedcomprehensive epigenetic repression of memory T cell-associated genes, including TCF7, thereby promoting effector T-cell differentiation. Importantly, memory Tcells generated by Rdh deficiency and blocking RAR signaling elicited potentanti-tumor responses in adoptive T-cell transfer setting. Thus, T celldifferentiation is regulated by vitamin A metabolism and its signaling, whichshould be novel targets for memory T cell-based cancer immunotherapy.

AB  - Changes in pulmonary microhemodynamics in response to pulmonary embolism underconditions of activation of KATP channels with nicorandil, Kv channels withdapagliflozin, and BKCa channels with Evans blue were studied on isolated rabbit lungs. Under conditions of activation of KATP and BKCa channels, the constrictor reactions of the pulmonary arterial vessels during embolization of the pulmonary artery were less pronounced than in the control. Activation of BKCa channelsreduced constrictor reactions of the pulmonary venous vessels, while activationof KATP and Kv channels eliminates them. The shifts of the capillary filtrationcoefficient are determined to a greater extent by the pre-/postcapillaryresistance ratio, than by changes of the endothelial permeability. Pretreatmentwith dapagliflozin led to a decrease in the capillary filtration coefficient. It was established, that nimesulide exhibits properties of a BKCa-channel activator.

TI  - The association of vitamin D binding protein levels and genotypes with type 1diabetes in the black South African population.
PG  - 182
LID - 10.1186/s12902-022-01097-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency and the vitamin D pathway have previously beenassociated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). The majority of vitamin D is transportedthrough the blood bound to the vitamin D binding protein (VDBP). Twopolymorphisms in the VDBP gene (rs4588 and rs7041) result in different VDBPvariants and have been associated with T1D, however the results are notconsistent. The association of VDBP levels and its polymorphisms with T1D havenot been investigated in the black South African population. Therefore, thisstudy aimed to determine whether rs4588, rs7041 or serum VDBP levels wereassociated with T1D in this population. METHODS: Participants with type 1diabetes and controls were recruited from the greater Johannesburg area, SouthAfrica. Participants were genotyped for rs4588 and rs7041 using PCR-RFLP andserum VDBP levels were determined by ELISA. RESULTS: There was no difference inVDBP allelic or genotypic frequencies between participants with T1D and controls (rs4588 C allele frequency 0.92 vs. 0.94; p = 0.390 and rs7041 T allele frequency0.95 vs. 0.95; p = 0.890). In univariate analysis, the rs4588 CC genotype wasassociated with increased serum VDBP levels, however, this association was lostwith multivariate analysis. The VDBP genotypes were not associated with any otherstudy variables. In logistic regression analysis, higher VBDP levels wereassociated with T1D (OR: (95% CI): 6.58 (1.45-29.9); p = 0.015), and within alinear regression analysis, T1D disease status was found to be associated with0.044 mg/ml higher VDBP levels (p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that serum VDBP levels are positively associated with the presence of T1D in theAfrican population. Whether VDBP lies in the causal pathway or its elevation isan effect of T1D is uncertain and requires further investigation.

LID - 10.2478/enr-2022-0019 [doi]
AB  - Objective. The aim of the present work is to define the risk factors that canaffect the presence of a cognitive impairment and analyze the associations of thebrain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene polymorphism (rs6265), vitamin Dreceptor (VDR) gene polymorphism (rs2228570), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)receptor gene polymorphism (rs4880213) with the cognitive impairment in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis and hypothyroidism in the Western Ukraine population and predict the development of cognitive disorders in these patients. Methods.The study involved 153 patients with various forms of thyroid pathology(hypothyroidism, autoimmune thyroiditis, elevated serum antibodiesanti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase). Cognitive impairment in theexamined patients was evaluated based on the results of the Mini-Mental StateExamination (MMSE) test. BDNF, GRIN2B, and 25-OH Vitamin D levels in the serum ofthe patients and healthy individuals were quantified using highly sensitivecommercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Genotyping of the VDR(rs2228570), BDNF (rs6265), and NMDA receptor (rs4880213) gene polymorphism wasperformed using TaqMan probes and Taq-Man Genotyping Master Mix (4371355) onCFX96Real-Time PCR Detection System. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for TaqMangenotyping was carried out according to the kit instructions. Results. Strongdirect relationship between the "Level GRIN2B" and cognitive impairments(p=0.006) was established after evaluating the complex model based on the values of the regression coefficient. An increase in the likelihood of cognitiveimpairment by 24.898-fold (p=0.012) was seen after assessing the effect of the CTrs6265 genotype. In addition, direct relationship between the influence of the TTrs6265 genotype and an increase in the likelihood of cognitive impairment by afactor of 21.734 (p=0.024) was also established. Conclusion. The present dataindicate that the BDNF, TSH, fT4, and vitamin D levels prognostically belong tothe significant indicators of the cognitive impairment development.

TI  - Effects of aerobic exercise on adiponectin levels potentially mediated by vitaminD in type 2 diabetic patients.
PG  - 201-208
LID - 10.2478/enr-2022-0021 [doi]
AB  - Objective. The positive effects of exercise on adiponectin and vitamin D haveindependently been reported. Recent studies have suggested that vitamin Dincreases adiponectin synthesis through inhibition of the rennin-angiotensinsystem in adipose tissue. However, studies evaluating the effects of an aerobicexercise on adiponectin and vitamin D simultaneously investigating the potential mechanism of vitamin D-dependent adiponectin pathways in patients with type 2diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are still limited. This study was undertaken to examine the effects of aerobic exercise on adiponectin and its association with vitamin Din patients with T2DM. Methods. Total twenty-two patients with T2DM were randomlydivided into intervention and control group. The intervention group underwent amoderate intensity of a walking mode treadmill aerobic exercise for four weeks.The exercise protocol was adapted from modified Bruce test with a periodic speed and inclination increase. In both groups, body mass index (BMI), vitamin D, andadiponectin levels, were measured before and after four weeks of the lastingprogram. Results. The mean of the increased adiponectin and vitamin D levelsafter exercise was significantly higher in the intervened than the control group,but statistically significant difference was only found in the adiponectin effect(p=0.017). There was a significant association found between vitamin D andadiponectin in the intervention group after data adjustments to age and BMI(p=0.005). Conclusion. Moderate intensity of treadmill exercise with increasedspeed and inclination periodically increased adiponectin level in patients withT2DM. The increased adiponectin might potentially be mediated by increasedvitamin D, but the level of their association impact was dependent on the age andBMI.

AB  - The present study aimed to tackle research gaps regarding how infrared heatingaffected macro- and micronutrients of lentil flours from seeds varying in size.Infrared treatments reduced resistant starch contents of lentil flours from26.1-33.6% to 6.0-17.8%, increased protein digestibility from 73.6-75.0% to78.2-82.2%, and enhanced soluble dietary fiber contents from 6.1-7.8% to7.4-10.3%. Infrared treatments did not alter the primary limiting amino acid ofGreenstar and Imvincible lentil flours (tryptophan) but changed that of Maxim to methionine + cysteine at 150 degrees C heating. Regarding micronutrients, thethermal modifications decreased the levels of heat-labile B vitamins, includingB1 (thiamine), B3 (niacin), and B9 (mainly 5-methylterahydrofolate), consistentwith reducing alpha-amylase activity to an undetectable level in all the threelentil flours. The novel findings from this research will be meaningful for theagri-food industry to utilize infrared processing as an effective and clean-labelapproach to improving the nutritional profiles of lentil and other flours.

AB  - The development of chemo/photothermal nanotherapeutic systems with excellentphotothermal performance, stable drug loading, tumor targeting and strongmembrane penetration still remains a challenge. To address this problem, herein arod-like nanocomposite system (AuNR@FA-PR/PEG) forming from folic acid (FA)terminated carboxylated cyclodextrin (CD) pseudopolyrotaxane (FA-PR) andpolyethylene glycol (PEG) modifying gold nanorods (AuNR) was reported. Cisplatin (CDDP) was loaded in AuNR@FA-PR/PEG via coordination bonds to prepare a rod-like pH-responsive nanosystem (AuNR@FA-PR/PEG/CDDP) with chemotherapy/photothermaltherapy. The rod-like morphology of AuNR@FA-PR/PEG was characterized bytransmission electron microscope. In vitro drug release experiments showed thepH-responsive of AuNR@FA-PR/PEG/CDDP. In vivo real-time imaging assays provedAuNR@FA-PR/PEG/CDDP could rapidly enrich in the tumor area and stay for a longtime because of folate targeting and their rod-like morphology. In vivophotothermal imaging assays showed AuNR@FA-PR/PEG/CDDP excellent photothermalperformance, the average temperature of tumor region could reach 63.5 degrees Cafter 10 min irradiation. In vitro and in vivo experiments also demonstrated thatthe combined therapy of chemotherapy and photothermal therapy had anoutstandingly synergistic effect and improved the therapeutic efficacy comparing with chemotherapy and photothermal therapy alone. Therefore, the preparedrod-like AuNR@FA-PR/PEG/CDDP will provide a new strategy for the effectivetreatment of cancer.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Psidium guajava L. leaves are used to treatdiabetes in South African folkloric medicine and in other parts of the world.Psidium x durbanensis Baijnath & Ramcharun ined. (PD) is a natural sterile hybridand congener of Psidium guajava that is expected to share the medicinalproperties of the genus Psidium and is widely distributed in South Africa. AIM OFTHE STUDY: This study investigates the antioxidant, antidiabetic effects, andmechanisms of action of hydro-methanolic leaf extracts of PD onstreptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Phytochemicalconstituents of hydro-methanolic extract of PD were analyzed by gaschromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Male Wistar rats 250-300 g body weight (BW) were rendered diabetic after a single intraperitoneal injection withstreptozotocin, 45 mg/kg BW. The diabetic rats were treated with hydro-methanolic(20:80 v/v) leaf extracts of PD (400 mg/kg/BW) or subcutaneous injections ofregular insulin (2.0U/kg/BW, bid) for 56 days. The body weights of the animalswere recorded daily. Fasting blood glucose, glucose tolerance tests, and insulin resistance index were measured. The effects of the extracts on total superoxidedismutase, catalase, and reduced glutathione activities, histopathology, and geneexpression of insulin receptor substrate 1 and glucose transporter 4 weredetermined in the liver, pancreas, and gastrocnemius muscles of the rats.RESULTS: In the acute toxicity studies, there were no signs of toxicity observed for PD up to 2000 mg/kg BW doses. Diabetic animals showed significant weightloss, elevated and reduced fasting blood glucose and insulin, respectively,impaired glucose tolerance and diminished antioxidant enzymes' activitiescompared to controls. Treatment with PD hydro-methanolic leaf extracts improvedbody weight, glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and antioxidant enzymes butnot plasma insulin in diabetic animals compared to controls, respectively. GC-MS analysis identified organic acids, alcohols, vitamins, terpenoids, and esters in the extracts. Treatment with PD improved glucose uptake by stimulating mRNAexpression of GLUT 4 in gastrocnemius muscles of diabetic animals compared to theuntreated control and also restored histological aberrations in the pancreas and liver of diabetic rats compared with the untreated control rats. CONCLUSION:Collectively, the present study suggests that treatment with PD leaf extractssignificantly ameliorated diabetes symptoms and oxidative stress in rats, andthese effects may be linked to the bioactive phytoconstituents present in theplant. This study further suggests that PD improves insulin resistance byincreasing glucose uptake in gastrocnemius muscles in an insulin-independentmanner.

TI  - Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB regulates the airway tone via activationof MAP2K, thromboxane, actin polymerisation and Ca(2+)-sensitisation.
PG  - 189
LID - 10.1186/s12931-022-02101-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: PDGFR-inhibition by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) nintedanibattenuates the progress of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). However, theeffects of PDGF-BB on the airway tone are almost unknown. We studied this issueand the mechanisms beyond, using isolated perfused lungs (IPL) of guinea pigs(GPs) and precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) of GPs and humans. METHODS: IPL:PDGF-BB was perfused after or without pre-treatment with the TKI imatinib(perfused/nebulised) and its effects on the tidal volume (TV), the dynamiccompliance (Cdyn) and the resistance were studied. PCLS (GP): Thebronchoconstrictive effects of PDGF-BB and the mechanisms beyond were evaluated. PCLS (human): The bronchoconstrictive effects of PDGF-BB and the bronchorelaxant effects of imatinib were studied. All changes of the airway tone were measured byvideomicroscopy and indicated as changes of the initial airway area. RESULTS:PCLS (GP/human): PDGF-BB lead to a contraction of airways. IPL: PDGF-BB decreasedTV and Cdyn, whereas the resistance did not increase significantly. In bothmodels, inhibition of PDGFR-(beta) (imatinib/SU6668) prevented thebronchoconstrictive effect of PDGF-BB. The mechanisms beyond PDGF-BB-inducedbronchoconstriction include activation of MAP2K and TP-receptors, actinpolymerisation and Ca(2+)-sensitisation, whereas the increase of Ca(2+) itselfand the activation of EP1-4-receptors were not of relevance. In addition,imatinib relaxed pre-constricted human airways. CONCLUSIONS: PDGFR regulates the airway tone. In PCLS from GPs, this regulatory mechanism depends on thebeta-subunit. Hence, PDGFR-inhibition may not only represent a target to improve chronic airway disease such as IPF, but may also provide acute bronchodilation inasthma. Since asthma therapy uses topical application. This is even morerelevant, as nebulisation of imatinib also appears to be effective.

TI  - The association between vitamin D levels and oxidative stress markers in EgyptianBehcet's disease patients.
PG  - 264
LID - 10.1186/s13023-022-02416-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Oxidative stress is postulated to have a major role in thepathophysiology of Bechet's Disease (BD). Growing evidence suggests that vitamin D has important roles in enhancing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines as well as certain antioxidants. However, there is little evidence currentlyabout the antioxidant properties of vitamin D in BD. OBJECTIVE: To study therelationship between vitamin D levels and the oxidative stress markers inpatients with BD in addition to its association with disease activity andseverity. METHODS: Sixty BD patients (45 males, 15 females; mean age: 34.2 +/-9.6 years) were enrolled in this study and compared to a sex and age matchedcontrol group. Plasma 25-Hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH-D) was measured using Human(25-OH-D) ELISA assay. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), reducedglutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase (CAT) activityand total antioxidant capacity (TAC) were determined by spectrophotometricmethods in both groups. Plasma calcium (Ca) was measured by ELISA assay. RESULTS:When compared to controls vitamin D, GSH, CAT activity, TAC and Ca weresignificantly lower in BD patients, while MDA and NO levels were significantlyincreased in BD patients. Our Results Found that vitamin D was inverselycorrelated to BD current Activity form (BDCAF), disease severity score, ESR, CRP,MDA and NO, while vitamin D was significantly positively correlated to GSH, SOD, TAC and Ca. CONCLUSION: Our study confirms that a lower level of vitamin D isassociated with the oxidative stress state in BD patients as detected by MDA and NO elevation as well as decreased GSH, SOD activity, CAT activity and TAC. Hence,Vitamin D fortified foods and beverages or supplementation may improve diseaseseverity and oxidative stress in BD patients.

AB  - Photoisomerization of lipids has been well studied. As for the eyes,photoisomerization from 11-cis isomer to all-trans-retinal is well-known as thefirst step of the visual transduction in the photoreceptors. In addition to that,there would be other ocular lipids that undergo photoisomerization, which may be involved in ocular health and function. To explore any photoisomerizable lipidsin the eyes, the nonirradiated and sunlight-irradiated eyeball extracts weresubjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis, followed by theidentification of the decreased lipid species in the irradiated extracts.Surprisingly, more than nine hundred lipid species were decreased in theirradiated extracts. Three lipid species, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10),triglyceride(58:4), and coenzyme Q9, were decreased both significantly (p < 0.05)and by more than two-fold, where CoQ10 showed the most significant decrease.Later, photoisomerization was identified as the prominent cause underlying thedecrease of CoQ10. Interestingly, CoQ10 in the sunlight-irradiated fresh eyeballswas also isomerized. Both the visible light and ultraviolet radiation werecapable of producing CoQ10 isomer, while the latter showed rapid action. Thisstudy is believed to enhance our understanding of the biochemistry andphotodamage of the eye and can potentially contribute to the advancement ofopto-lipidomics.

TI  - Fatty acid tryptamide from cacao elongates Drosophila melanogaster lifespan with sirtuin-dependent heat shock protein expression.
PG  - 12080
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16471-1 [doi]
AB  - Life span is increasing in developed countries as Japan, and an aging society is becoming a problem. In fact, healthy lifespan is not extended, and it is desired to extend it by functional food. Cacao (Theobroma cacao) contains various active components and is considered a preventative agent against metabolic disease. Inaddition, it has long been thought that regular cacao intake extends a healthylifespan. However, there is no direct evidence for this belief. The purpose ofthis study is to identify the cacao component that elongate the lifespan of D.melanogaster as a model organism and to elucidate its functional mechanism. Theactivation of sirtuins, a family of NAD+-dependent deacetylases, has beenreported to extend the lifespans of various organisms. Heat shock factor 1 isknown to be deacetylated by reaction with sirtuins, thereby inducing geneexpression of various heat shock proteins by heat stress and effectivelyextending the lifespan of organisms. Therefore, we evaluated whether componentsin cacao activate sirtuins and extend the lifespan of D. melanogaster. In theprocess, we discovered the fatty acid tryptamide as a lifespan-elongatingcomponent of cacao. Therefore, we investigated whether the fatty acid tryptamide from cacao upregulates the genes of heat shock proteins. As a result, it wasconfirmed that the gene expression of multiple heat shock proteins wassignificantly increased. This suggests that fatty acid tryptamide may activatesirtuins, increase gene expression of heat shock proteins, and elongate thelifespan of D. melanogaster.

AB  - Biotin (B8), folates (B9), and vitamin B12 (B12) are involved and interrelated inseveral metabolic reactions related to energy and protein metabolism. Wehypothesized that a low supply of one of the latter vitamins during thetransition period would impair metabolic status. The purpose of this study was toevaluate the effect of B8 supplementation on the response of lactationperformance and selected energy and protein metabolites and hormones to acombined supplementation of B9 and B12 given to periparturient dairy cows, from d-21 to 21 relative to calving. A total of 32 multiparous Holstein cows housed in tie stalls were randomly assigned, according to their previous 305-d milk yield, to 8 incomplete blocks of 4 treatments: (1) a 2-mL weekly i.m. injection ofsaline (0.9% NaCl; B8-/B9B12-); (2) 20 mg/d of dietary B8 (unprotected fromruminal degradation) and 2-mL weekly i.m. injection of 0.9% NaCl (B8+/B9B12-);(3) 2.6 g/d of dietary B9 (unprotected) and 2-mL weekly i.m. injection of 10 mgof B12 (B8-/B9B12+); and (4) 20 mg/d of dietary B8, 2.6 g/d of dietary B9, andweekly i.m. injection of 10 mg of B12 (B8+/B9B12+) in a 2 x 2 factorialarrangement. Milk yield and dry matter intake were obtained daily and milkcomponents weekly. Blood samples were taken weekly from d -21 to calving and 3times per week from calving to 21 d following parturition. Prepartum plasmaconcentrations of glucose, insulin, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA),beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and adiponectin were unaffected by treatments.Biotin, B9, and B12 supplements increased their respective concentrations inplasma and milk. Cows fed the B8 supplement tended to have lower dry matterintake, but only cows in B8+/B9B12- had greater plasma concentrations of NEFAcompared with B8-/B9B12-. Milk and total solid yields were greater by 13.5 and13.9%, respectively, for B8-/B9B12+ [45.5 (standard error, SE: 1.8) and 5.81(0.22) kg/d, respectively] compared with B8-/B9B12- [40.1 (1.9) and 5.10 (0.23)kg/d, respectively], but these effects were suppressed when combined with the B8 supplement. Cows in the B8-/B9B12+ group had decreased plasma insulin and tended to have increased NEFA concentrations, but postpartum plasma concentrations ofglucose, BHB, leptin, and adiponectin were not affected. These cows alsomobilized more body fat reserves, as suggested by a tendency to increased plasma NEFA and more milk total solids compared with B8-/B9B12- cows. However, plasmaconcentrations of BHB and adiponectin were similar among treatments. Thissuggests that the B9 and B12 supplements enhanced efficiency of energy metabolismin early lactation cows. Folic acid and B12 supplementation increased postpartum plasma Cys and homocysteine concentrations but did not affect plasma Metconcentration, suggesting an upregulation of the transsulfuration pathway. Insummary, our results showed that, under the current experimental conditions,increasing B8 supply did not improve responses to the B9 and B12 supplementation.

AB  - Characterization of variation of experimental results is achieved by repeatingexperiments. Frequently, results are averaged before data are analysed but thatmay not be the best practice because valuable information is then lost. Threeother ways to analyze repetitions are: (1) each experiment is analyzed on its own(no pooling of data), (2) all experiments are analyzed together in one go(complete pooling), (3) data are analyzed together while allowing forsimilarities as well as differences in the result (partial pooling). Multilevelmodeling uses partial pooling by partitioning variance over more than one level. Level 1 consists of the measurements themselves; higher levels consist of groups or clusters of measurements (repetitions, experiments at various temperatures, atvarious pH values, etc.) and parameters are analyzed both at the population andat the group/cluster level. The approach is applied to a case study in whichheat-induced isothermal degradation of ascorbic acid was studied with 15repetitions in an aqueous solution, making it a two-level study. The data wereanalyzed using averaging and complete pooling, complete pooling withoutaveraging, no-pooling at all, and partial pooling. The kinetic model wasestablished by letting the data decide about the order of the reaction, whilethis was compared to a model where the order was fixed at 1 (first-order model). Results show that both averaging with complete pooling, as well as completepooling without averaging, strongly underestimate variation. The no-poolingtechnique overestimates variation, while partial pooling partitions variationover the levels and thus gives a better impression of the variation involved. Thekinetics of ascorbic acid appear to be subject to strong variation when eachexperiment is considered separately because it is a compound that is verysensitive to all kinds of experimental conditions. With multilevel modeling itappeared to be possible to characterize the uncertainties involved much betterthan with single level modeling. A Bayesian analysis was performed, in whichparameters are allowed to be variable, which is useful because multilevelmodeling leads to characterization of variation of parameters. The Bayesianmethod allows to visualize the posterior distribution of parameters, therebygiving more insight in their behaviour. Also, a Bayesian analysis focuses morestrongly on predictive accuracy of models, including multilevel models. Thepredictive accuracy of 4 models describing the same ascorbic acid data wascompared and the multilevel model with reaction order estimated from the dataperformed by far the best in this regard. The pros and cons of multilevelmodeling are discussed and it is concluded that multilevel modeling is to bepreferred whenever the data allow to perform such an analysis.

AB  - Selenium (Se) is critical for human health, but human intake of Se is ofteninadequate. Organic forms of dietary Se are considered safe and more bioavailablethan inorganic forms. Along with a generally high nutritional value, sprouts are sensitive to Se treatment. This study used selenomethionine andmethylselenocysteine solutions to cultivate Se-enriched sprouts under anoptimized hydroponic condition. Content change and transformations of theselenoamino acids were analyzed by a developed HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method. Uptake ofboth selenomethionine and methylselenocysteine was dose-dependent and involvedactive transport and passive diffusion, as demonstrated by the respiratory andaquaporin inhibition assays. Passive diffusion played a dominant role. Freemethylselenocysteine was the predominant form in samples. Selenomethionine andmethylselenocysteine were capable of mutual transformation. Moreover, theselenoprotein generation was associated with the increasing Se concentration ofthe culture solutions. The results provided scientific references for theefficient utilization of organic Se in sprouts.

AB  - This work evaluated the effect of convective drying of mango impregnated withgrape residue flour polyphenols under different vacuum impregnation methods with or without performing osmotic treatment and ultrasound on the global quality ofdried mango in relation to chemical, microbiological and sensory aspects. Higher retention of carotenoids, phenolic compounds, and ascorbic acid was obtained withshorter drying times and lower oxygen exposure. Impregnated dried samplessubmitted to ultrasound-assisted vacuum impregnation showed a higher drying rate,greater retention of carotenoids (6.77 microg/g DM), and softer samples. Greater retention of phenolic compounds (1.84 mg GAE/g DM) was obtained for osmoticdehydration-assisted vacuum impregnation dried mango, whileosmosonication-assisted impregnation was able to retain the highest ascorbic acidcontent (7.05 mg/100 g DM). Sensory evaluation showed that the impregnatedsamples showed good acceptance. The combination of osmotic dehydration andultrasound could be a suitable way to produce dried mango impregnated with grape residue polyphenols.

AB  - The impact of photosensitizer and wavelength on photooxidation of phytosterols(PS) in soymilk and the oxidative stability of lipid and protein was determined. The oxidation of lipid and the consumption of dissolved oxygen showed a closerelationship with PS oxidation. Riboflavin (Rb) leads to extra oxidation of both lipid and protein, and chlorophyll (Chl) prefer to absorb to and change thestructure of protein. The influence of Rb and Chl on PS degradation underdifferent wavelengths of light in the range of 365-665 nm was measured. Original soymilk emulsion placed under UVA (365-375 nm) and violet (400-410 nm) lightunderwent the most PS deterioration, whereas riboflavin was responsible foroxidation around blue (465-475 nm) region and extra formation of 6beta-OHsterols, and chlorophyll enriched emulsion was vulnerable under red (645-665 nm) light. The wavelength of light (UVA > violet > blue > green > red > yellow)showed a great different effect in oxidation of PS and formation of phytosteroloxidation products (POPs). The UVA, violet, blue and red light gives rise to the prior five kind oxides of phytosterol: 6alpha-OH, 7alpha-OH, 7beta-OH,5,6beta-epoxy and 7-keto.

AB  - Dietary intervention is a safe, broad-spectrum, and low-cost preventive strategy for slow aging. The Okinawan, Mediterranean, and Dietary approaches to stophypertension (DASH) diets, as well as caloric restriction (CR) and intermittentfasting (IF), are classic and reliable dietary patterns that slow aging byregulating nutrient-sensing pathways, gut microbiota, metabolism, and immunity.Moreover, the proportion of the three macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein andfat) is also vital for slowing aging, but the debates about the appropriateproportion, especially the ratio of carbohydrates and proteins, remain unknown.Strict and lifelong adherence to these regimens is difficult, thereby promotingthe emergence of various dietary supplements, including natural CR mimics,probiotics, natural senolytics, vitamins and essential minerals. Combinations of different dietary patterns and supplements with distinct pathways may haveadditive effects. Individuals' aging speed and dietary response are highlyvariable, thus highlighting the need for precise anti-aging dietary intervention.Nutrigenomics plays an important role in personalized dietary strategies.Therefore, this review critically compares the anti-aging effects of variousdietary patterns and supplements, analyzes their mechanisms and combined use, andproposes future research directions to achieve personalized dietary strategiesfor slowing aging.

AB  - The use of probiotic and synbiotic is a promising strategy to modulate theintestinal microbiota, and thereby modify the risk of diseases. In this study,the effect of probiotic VSL#3, isolated or associated with a yacon-based product (PBY), on the functional metabolic pathways of the microbiota, in a colorectalcarcinogenesis model, was evaluated. For this, mice induced to carcinogenesiswere fed with standard diet AIN-93 M (CON), diet AIN-93 M and VSL#3 (PRO) or dietAIN-93 M with yacon and VSL#3 (SYN). The SYN group showed a highly differentiatedintestinal community based on the MetaCyc pathways. Of the 351 predictedfunctional pathways, 222 differed between groups. Most of them were enriched inthe SYN group, namely: amino acid biosynthesis pathways, small moleculebiosynthesis pathways (cofactors, prosthetic groups, electron carriers andvitamins) carbohydrate degradation pathways and fermentation pathways. Inaddition, the synbiotic was able to stimulate the anti-inflammatory immuneresponse and reduce the gene expression of PCNA and c-myc. Thus, we conclude thatthe synbiotic impacted more significantly the metabolic functions of themicrobiota compared to the isolated use of probiotic. We believe that theenrichment of these pathways can exert antiproliferative action, reducingcolorectal carcinogenesis. The prediction of the functional activity of themicrobiota is a promising tool for understanding the influence of the microbiome on tumor development.

TI  - Simulating Colorectal Cancer Trials Using Real-World Data.
PG  - e2100195
LID - 10.1200/CCI.21.00195 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Using real-world data (RWD)-based trial simulation approach, we aim tosimulate colorectal cancer (CRC) trials and examine both effectiveness and safetyend points in different simulation scenarios. METHODS: We identified five phaseIII trials comparing new treatment regimens with an US Food and DrugAdministration-approved first-line treatment in patients with metastatic CRC (ie,fluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan) as the standard-of-care (SOC) controlarm. Using Electronic Health Record-derived data from the OneFlorida network, we defined the study populations and outcome measures using the protocols from theoriginal trials. Our design scenarios were (1) simulation of the SOCfluorouracil, leucovorin, and irinotecan arm and (2) comparative effectivenessresearch (CER) simulation of the control and experimental arms. For eachscenario, we adjusted for random assignment, sampling, and dropout. We usedoverall survival (OS) and severe adverse events (SAEs) to measure effectivenessand safety. RESULTS: We conducted CER simulations for two trials, and SOCsimulations for three trials. The effect sizes of our simulated trials werestable across all simulation runs. Compared with the original trials, we observedlonger OS and higher mean number of SAEs in both CER and SOC simulation. In thetwo CER simulations, hazard ratios associated with death from simulations weresimilar to that reported in the original trials. Consistent with the originaltrials, we found higher risk ratios of SAEs in the experiment arm, suggestingpotentially higher toxicities from the new treatment regimen. We also observedsimilar SAE rates across all simulations compared with the original trials.CONCLUSION: In this study, we simulated five CRC trials, and tested twosimulation scenarios with several different configurations demonstrated that our simulations can robustly generate effectiveness and safety outcomes comparablewith the original trials using real-world data.

TI  - Alterations in Somatic Driver Genes Are Associated with Response to NeoadjuvantFOLFIRINOX in Patients with Localized Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.
PG  - 342-349
LID - 10.1097/XCS.0000000000000212 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increased use of neoadjuvant fluorouracil, leucovorin,irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) in the management of localizedpancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), yet there are few validated biomarkersof treatment response. STUDY DESIGN: Consecutive patients (n = 196) withresectable, borderline resectable or locally advanced PDAC (2012-2019) receiving FOLFIRINOX as initial treatment and with targeted sequencing of a pretreatmentbiopsy were identified in a prospective institutional database. Genomicalterations were determined in the 4 driver mutations (KRAS, TP53, CDKN2A,SMAD4), and associations between genomic alterations and clinical outcomes wereassessed. RESULTS: Alterations in KRAS (n = 172, 87.8%) and TP53 (n = 131, 66.8%)were common; alterations in CDKN2A (n = 49, 25.0%) and SMAD4 (n = 36, 18.4%) wereless frequently observed. A total of 105 patients (53.6%) were able to undergoresection, of whom 8 (7.6%) had a complete/near-complete pathologic response.There were no somatic alterations associated with major pathologic response.Alterations in SMAD4 were associated with a lower rate of surgical resection(27.8% vs 59.4%, p < 0.001); this was additionally observed in a multivariableregression model accounting for resectability status (OR 0.35, 95% confidenceinterval [CI] 0.15-0.85). Thirty-three patients (16.8%) developed metastaticdisease while on neoadjuvant therapy. SMAD4 alterations were associated with asignificant risk of metastatic progression on therapy when controlling forresectability status (OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.44-7.60). CONCLUSIONS: SMAD4 alterations are associated with more frequent development of metastasis during neoadjuvantFOLFIRINOX and lower probability of reaching surgical resection. Evaluation ofalternative chemotherapy regimens in patients with SMAD4 alterations will beimportant to distinguish whether this represents a prognostic or predictivebiomarker.

TI  - Is vitamin D deficiency a risk factor for all-cause mortality andrehospitalization in heart failure patients?: A systematic review andmeta-analysis.
PG  - e29507
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000029507 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The association of low 25-hydroxyvitamin D level with mortality andrehospitalization remains inconsistent in patients with heart failure. Thissystematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the value of blood25-hydroxyvitamin D level in predicting all-cause mortality and hospitalizationin heart failure patients. METHODS: Two reviewers independently search thearticles indexed in PubMed and Embase databases until November 30, 2021. Only theprospective or retrospective cohort studies evaluating the association of blood25-hydroxyvitamin D level with all-cause mortality and rehospitalization in heartfailure patients were selected. The predictive value of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levelwas summarized by pooling multivariable adjusted risk estimates for the bottomversus reference top 25-hydroxyvitamin D level. RESULTS: Seven studies with atotal of 5941 patients with heart failure were identified. The pooled adjustedrisk ratio (RR) of all-cause mortality was 1.37 (95% confidence interval [CI]1.13-1.66), with significant heterogeneity (I2 = 70.5%; P = 0.002). However,there was no clear association between low 25-hydroxyvitamin D level andall-cause rehospitalization risk (RR 1.38; 95% CI 0.87-2.19). CONCLUSIONS: Lowblood level of 25-hydroxyvitamin D may be an independent risk factor forall-cause mortality in patients with heart failure. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin Dlevel may provide prognostic information in heart failure patients. Additionalrandomized controlled trials are required to explore whether treatment of25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency by supplementation of vitamin D can improvesurvival in heart failure patients.

AB  - Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) plays an essential electron carrier role in themitochondrial electron transfer chain (ETC) as well as being a potent antioxidantand influencing inflammatory mediators. In view of these functions, the reasonwhy certain individuals may be more susceptible to the severe disease orlong-term complications (long COVID) of COVID-19 infection may be associated withan underlying deficit in cellular CoQ10 status. Thus, our group has outlined ananalytical method for the determination of cellular CoQ10 status using HPLClinked UV detection at 275 nm. This method has been utilized in patient tissuesamples to investigate evidence of a CoQ10 deficiency and thus may have potentialin determining the possible susceptibility of individuals to severe diseaseassociated with COVID-19 infection or to long COVID.

TI  - Metabolic activation of tachysterol3 to biologically active hydroxyderivativesthat act on VDR, AhR, LXRs, and PPARgamma receptors.

AB  - CYP11A1 and CYP27A1 hydroxylate tachysterol3 , a photoproduct of previtamin D3 , producing 20S-hydroxytachysterol3 [20S(OH)T3 ] and 25(OH)T3 , respectively. Both metabolites were detected in the human epidermis and serum. Tachysterol3 was alsodetected in human serum at a concentration of 7.3 +/- 2.5 ng/ml. 20S(OH)T3 and25(OH)T3 inhibited the proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes and dermalfibroblasts and stimulated the expression of differentiation and anti-oxidativegenes in keratinocytes in a similar manner to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3 ]. They acted on the vitamin D receptor (VDR) as demonstrated by image flowcytometry and the translocation of VDR coupled GFP from the cytoplasm to thenucleus of melanoma cells, as well as by the stimulation of CYP24A1 expression.Functional studies using a human aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) reporter assaysystem revealed marked activation of AhR by 20S(OH)T3 , a smaller effect by25(OH)T3 , and a minimal effect for their precursor, tachysterol3 . Tachysterol3 hydroxyderivatives showed high-affinity binding to the ligan-binding domain (LBD)of the liver X receptor (LXR) alpha and beta, and the peroxisomeproliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) in LanthaScreen TR-FRETcoactivator assays. Molecular docking using crystal structures of the LBDs ofVDR, AhR, LXRs, and PPARgamma revealed high docking scores for 20S(OH)T3 and25(OH)T3 , comparable to their natural ligands. The scores for thenon-genomic-binding site of the VDR were very low indicating a lack ofinteraction with tachysterol3 ligands. Our identification of endogenousproduction of 20S(OH)T3 and 25(OH)T3 that are biologically active and interactwith VDR, AhR, LXRs, and PPARgamma, provides a new understanding of thebiological function of tachysterol3 .

PG  - 366-372
LID - 10.1097/COC.0000000000000921 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Metastasectomy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC)confers a significant survival benefit. We hypothesized that conversion toresectability (C2R) correlates with superior overall survival (OS) in patientswith unresectable mCRC. METHODS: A prospectively registered systematic review(PROSPERO CRD42015024104) of randomized clinical trials published after 2003 was conducted. Exposure of interest was C2R with a primary outcome of OS. Clinicaltrials were classified based on difference in C2R between study arms (<2%, 2% to 2.9%, >/=3%). Generalized estimating equations were used to measure associations while adjusting for multiple observations from the same trial. RESULTS: Of 2902studies reviewed, 30 satisfied selection criteria (n=13,618 patients). Median C2Rwas 7.3% (interquartile range [IQR]: 5% to 12.9%), with maximum C2R in theFOLFOX/FOLFIRI+cetuximab arm (28.6%). The median difference in C2R between 2 armsof the same study was 2.3% (IQR: 1.3% to 3.4%) with a maximum difference of 15.4%seen in FOLFOX/FOLFIRI+cetuximab versus FOLFOX/FOLFIRI. Median OS for the entire patient cohort was 20.7 months (IQR: 18.9 to 22.7 mo), with a between groupdifference of 1.3 months (IQR: -1.2 to 3.6 mo). The median survival differencebetween the 2 study arms with <2% C2R difference was 0.8 months versus 1.6 monthswith >/=3% C2R rates . Increasing C2R had an incremental dose-effect response on OS ( P =0.021), and higher response rates correlated with C2R rates ( P =0.003). CONCLUSIONS: C2R occurs infrequently and variably in clinical trials enrollingpatients with unresectable mCRC. Prioritization of chemotherapeutic agents thatenhance C2R might improve OS of patients.

AB  - Vitamin D plays an important role in mineral and bone homeostasis, immuneresponses, cardiovascular function and keratinocyte proliferation anddifferentiation. Vitamin D performs most of its functions by binding to vitamin Dreceptors (VDR), which interact with other intracellular signaling pathways toregulate bone metabolism, inflammation, immunity, cell cycle progression andapoptosis. Autophagy is a basic stress response in yeast, plants and mammals, andplays a critical role in maintaining optimal functional states at the level ofcells and organs. Vitamin D/VDR plays an anti-infection role via inducing andregulating autophagy.

PG  - 878498

AB  - Vegetables are a distinct collection of plant-based foods that vary innutritional diversity and form an important part of the healthy diet of the humanbeing. Besides providing basic nutrition, they have great potential for boosting human health. The balanced consumption of vegetables is highly recommended forsupplementing the human body with better nutrition density, dietary fiber,minerals, vitamins, and bioactive compounds. However, the production and quality of fresh vegetables are influenced directly or indirectly by exposure to hightemperatures or heat stress (HS). A decline in quality traits and harvestableyield are the most common effects of HS among vegetable crops. Heat-inducedmorphological damage, such as poor vegetative growth, leaf tip burning, and ribdiscoloration in leafy vegetables and sunburn, decreased fruit size, fruit/podabortion, and unfilled fruit/pods in beans, are common, often rendering vegetablecultivation unprofitable. Further studies to trace down the possiblephysiological and biochemical effects associated with crop failure reveal thatthe key factors include membrane damage, photosynthetic inhibition, oxidativestress, and damage to reproductive tissues, which may be the key factorsgoverning heat-induced crop failure. The reproductive stage of plants hasextensively been studied for HS-induced abnormalities. Plant reproduction is moresensitive to HS than the vegetative stages, and affects various reproductiveprocesses like pollen germination, pollen load, pollen tube growth, stigmareceptivity, ovule fertility and, seed filling, resulting in poorer yields.Hence, sound and robust adaptation and mitigation strategies are needed toovercome the adverse impacts of HS at the morphological, physiological, andbiochemical levels to ensure the productivity and quality of vegetable crops.Physiological traits such as the stay-green trait, canopy temperature depression,cell membrane thermostability, chlorophyll fluorescence, relative water content, increased reproductive fertility, fruit numbers, and fruit size are important fordeveloping better yielding heat-tolerant varieties/cultivars. Moreover, variousmolecular approaches such as omics, molecular breeding, and transgenics, havebeen proved to be useful in enhancing/incorporating tolerance and can bepotential tools for developing heat-tolerant varieties/cultivars. Further, these approaches will provide insights into the physiological and molecular mechanisms that govern thermotolerance and pave the way for engineering "designer" vegetablecrops for better health and nutritional security. Besides these approaches,agronomic methods are also important for adaptation, escape and mitigation of HS protect and improve yields.

AB  - Myoinositol (Myo) is an isoform of inositol, a cyclic polyol with 6 hydroxylgroups. Myo is mainly derived from dietary intake while its endogenous productionis generated from glucose by enzymatic reactions. Moreover, Myo is alsosynthesized de novo by catabolism of phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphoinositides(PIP), and inositol phosphates (IP). Myo has a determinant role in thyroidfunction and autoimmune diseases as it regulates iodine organification andthyroid hormone biosynthesis by the formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) inthyrocytes. Depletion of Myo that is involved in the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) signaling pathway, may cause the development of thyroid diseases such ashypothyroidism. TSH levels significantly decreased in patients with subclinicalhypothyroidism, with or without autoimmune thyroiditis, after treatment with Myo plus Selenium (Myo+Se). In addition to TSH, antithyroid autoantibodies arereduced. This review summarizes the role of Myo in the thyroidal physiology andits role in the management of some thyroid diseases.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the protective effects of crocetin against transforminggrowth factor-beta (TGF-beta)-induced injury in LO2 cells. Methods: Humanhepatocyte LO2 cells were pre-treated with crocetin (10 muM) for 6, 12, and 24 h,and then induced by TGF-beta. Proliferation, oxidative stress, apoptosis,autophagy, and related proteins were assessed. Results: Crocetin pre-treatingpromoted proliferation but suppressed apoptosis in TGF-beta-induced LO2 cells.Crocetin protected LO2 cells from TGF-beta-induced inflammation and oxygen stressby reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) but enhancingsuperoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH). Autophagy was suppressed inTGF-beta but crocetin promoted autophagy in LO2 cells by mediating Adenosine5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/mammalian target of rapamycin(m-TOR) signaling pathway via upregulating p-AMPK and p-Beclin-1 butdownregulating p-mTOR. Conclusions: Crocetin protected LO2 cells fromTGF-beta-induced damage by promoting proliferation and autophagy, and suppressingapoptosis and anti-inflammation via regulation of AMPK/m-TOR signaling pathway.

PG  - e54
LID - 10.1017/jns.2022.53 [doi]
AB  - Maternal obesity may compromise the micronutrient status of the offspring.Vitamin A (VA) is an essential micronutrient during neonatal development. Itsactive metabolite, retinoic acid (RA), is a key regulator of VA homeostasis,which also regulates adipose tissue (AT) development in obese adults. However,its role on VA status and AT metabolism in neonates was unknown and it wasdetermined in the present study. Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised to a normal fat diet (NFD) or a high fat diet (HFD). From postnatal day 5 (P5) toP20, half of the HFD pups received oral RA every 3 d (HFDRA group). NFD pups and the remaining HFD pups (HFD group) received placebo. Six hours after dosing onP8, P14 and P20, n 4 pups per group were euthanised for different measures. Itwas found that total retinol concentration in neonatal liver and lung wassignificantly lower in the HFD group than the NFD group, while the concentrationswere significantly increased in the HFDRA group. The HFD group exhibitedsignificantly higher body weight (BW) gain, AT mass, serum leptin andadiponectin, and gene expression of these adipokines in white adipose tissuecompared with the NFD group; these measures were significantly reduced in theHFDRA group. BAT UCP2 and UCP3 gene expression were significantly higher in pups receiving RA. In conclusion, repeated RA treatment during the suckling periodimproved the tissue VA status of neonates exposed to maternal obesity. RA alsoexerted a regulatory effect on neonatal obesity development by reducing BW gainand adiposity and modulating AT metabolism.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of voluntary fortified foods and supplements to reducing micronutrient shortfalls in the UKpopulation. A secondary analysis of the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey wasconducted (2012/13-2013/14, N 2546, 1.5-95 years). Micronutrient intakes werederived from food consumption intake data and food composition data andcalculated as the proportion below or above the Dietary Reference Values formales and females of different age groups, for those on a base diet only, usersof fortified foods but no supplements and users of fortified foods andsupplements. Of the population consuming a base diet only, 21-45 % and 5-29 %fell below the Estimated Average Requirement (EAR) for minerals and vitamins,respectively. About 3-13 % fewer consumers of fortified foods fell below the EAR for vitamins and minerals. Supplements barely reduced the prevalence of intakesbelow the EAR. Among supplement non-users and users, 99 and 96 % failed to meetthe reference intakes for vitamin D. More women than men were at risk ofinadequacies of micronutrient intakes. The prevalence of inadequacies declinedwith increasing age. Voluntary fortified foods but not supplements made ameaningful contribution to intakes of vitamin and minerals, without risk ofunacceptably high intakes. These insights may help the UK to define approaches toaddress micronutrients of concern in vulnerable groups.

AB  - Periconceptional folic acid supplementation is effective in the prevention ofneural tube defects (NTDs). The aim of the present study was to determine thelevel of knowledge about the benefits of preconceptional folic acidsupplementation in a sample of women of childbearing age and its associatedfactors. A cross-sectional community-based study design was carried out on atotal of 441 women of childbearing age. Questionnaires included knowledge ofpreconception of folic acid supplements and socio-demographic characteristics.The chi (2) was used to compare categorical data. Multivariate logisticregression was used to isolate the predictive variables and examined individuallyby calculating the adjusted odds ratio. Statistical significance is declared as P< 0.05. We found that 35.1 % (n 155) knew preconceptional folic acidsupplementation could prevent NTDs, and 3.8 % (n 17) knew the right time to take preconceptional folic acid supplementation and only 1.7 % (n 7) who had a historyof NTDs. Attended secondary education (OR 2.7; 95 % CI 1.1, 6.0, P = 0.017),governmental employee (OR 3.5; 95 % CI 2.3, 17.8, P < 0.001), current pregnancystatus (OR 3.0; 95 % CI 2.1, 4.2, P = 0.043), history of visiting the antenatalcare service during pregnancy (OR 2.9; 95 % CI 1.07, 7.8, P = 0.03), history oftaking folic acid supplement (OR 4.5; 95 % CI 2.9, 7.1, P < 0.001) wereassociated. More than half of the participant women did not know aboutpreconception of folic acid supplements that reduce the risk of NTDs.Identification of the level of knowledge on preconception of folic acid may allowfor targeted educational or other interventions to further encourage folic aciduse.

AB  - Diets higher in plants are associated with lower risks of chronic diseases.However, animal foods, which are rich in protein, are also rich in some importantminerals and vitamins. Using data from a representative survey in France (INCA3, n = 1,125), we used path analyses as a mediation-like approach to decipher theimportance of plant and animal proteins in the relationship between theplant-based diet index (PDI) and diet quality. We used three types of dietquality scores, namely, nutrient security, positive nutrient adequacy, andlong-term mortality risk of four diet-related diseases (i.e., coronary heartdisease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and colorectal cancer). We identified positive and negative mediations, i.e., changes in plant/animal protein intake that areassociated with changes in PDI, and favor or limit the association with the diet quality score. The PDI was positively associated with the risk of long-termmortality but not significantly with nutrient adequacy or nutrient security. Apositive mediation by plant protein was found for all diet quality scores(specific indirect effects (SIEs) ranging from 0.04 to 0.10 SD). Conversely, the association between PDI and nutrient adequacy (but not nutrient security) wasnegatively mediated by animal protein intake (SIE: -0.06 SD). In further detailedmodels, the association between PDI and diet quality was mainly positivelymediated by protein foods from the fruit-vegetables-legumes group (0.01 SD forthe nutrient security and 0.02 SD for the nutrient adequacy) and whole grains(0.02 SD for the nutrient adequacy). Our data suggest that the positive impact ofplant-based diets on diet quality is largely driven by higher intakes of plantprotein foods, especially from fruits-vegetables-legumes and whole grains.Conversely, lower animal protein intake tends to limit the positive impact ofplant-based diets on overall positive nutrient adequacy but not security. Proteinsources appear critical to healthy plant-based diets.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a ubiquitous metalloid and drinking water contaminant. Prenatal exposure is associated with birth outcomes across multiple studies. During metabolism, iAs is sequentially methylated to mono- anddi-methylated arsenical species (MMAs and DMAs) to facilitate whole bodyclearance. Inefficient methylation (e.g., higher urinary % MMAs) is associatedwith increased risk of certain iAs-associated diseases. One-carbon metabolismfactors influence iAs methylation, modifying toxicity in adults, and warrantfurther study during the prenatal period. The objective of this study was toevaluate folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine as modifiers of the relationshipbetween biomarkers of iAs methylation efficiency and birth outcomes. METHODS:Data from the Biomarkers of Exposure to ARsenic (BEAR) pregnancy cohort(2011-2012) with maternal urine and cord serum arsenic biomarkers and maternalserum folate, vitamin B12, and homocysteine concentrations were utilized.One-carbon metabolism factors were dichotomized using clinical cutoffs and mediansplits. Multivariable linear regression models were fit to evaluate associations between each biomarker and birth outcome overall and within levels of one-carbon metabolism factors. Likelihood ratio tests of full and reduced models were usedto test the significance of statistical interactions on the additive scale (alpha= 0.10). RESULTS: Among urinary biomarkers, % U-MMAs was most strongly associatedwith birth weight (beta = - 23.09, 95% CI: - 44.54, - 1.64). Larger, morenegative mean differences in birth weight were observed among infants born towomen who were B12 deficient (beta = - 28.69, 95% CI: - 53.97, - 3.42) orexperiencing hyperhomocysteinemia (beta = - 63.29, 95% CI: - 154.77, 28.19).Generally, mean differences in birth weight were attenuated among infants born tomothers with higher serum concentrations of folate and vitamin B12 (or lowerserum concentrations of homocysteine). Effect modification by vitamin B12 andhomocysteine was significant on the additive scale for some associations. Resultsfor gestational age were less compelling, with an approximate one-week meandifference associated with C-tAs (beta = 0.87, 95% CI: 0, 1.74), but notmeaningful otherwise. CONCLUSIONS: Tissue distributions of iAs and itsmetabolites (e.g., % MMAs) may vary according to serum concentrations of folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine during pregnancy. This represents a potentialmechanism through which maternal diet may modify the harms of prenatal exposureto iAs.

AB  - The WHI (Women's Health Initiative) enrolled 161,808 racially and ethnicallydiverse postmenopausal women, ages 50-79 years, from 1993 to 1998 at 40 clinical centers across the United States. In its clinical trial component, WHI evaluated 3 randomized interventions (menopausal hormone therapy; diet modification; andcalcium/vitamin D supplementation) for the primary prevention of major chronicdiseases, including cardiovascular disease, in older women. In the WHIobservational study, numerous clinical, behavioral, and social factors have been evaluated as predictors of incident chronic disease and mortality. Although theoriginal interventions have been completed, the WHI data and biomarker resources continue to be leveraged and expanded through ancillary studies to yield novelinsights regarding cardiovascular disease prevention and healthy aging in women.

TI  - Channel Function of Polycystin-2 in the Endoplasmic Reticulum Protects againstAutosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.
PG  - 1501-1516
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2022010053 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mutations of PKD2, which encodes polycystin-2, cause autosomaldominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The prevailing view is that defectsin polycystin-2-mediated calcium ion influx in the primary cilia play a centralrole in the pathogenesis of cyst growth. However, polycystin-2 is predominantlyexpressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and more permeable to potassium ions than to calcium ions. METHODS: The trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channelTRIC-B is an ER-resident potassium channel that mediates potassium-calciumcounterion exchange for inositol trisphosphate-mediated calcium ion release.Using TRIC-B as a tool, we examined the function of ER-localized polycystin-2 andits role in ADPKD pathogenesis in cultured cells, zebrafish, and mouse models.RESULTS: Agonist-induced ER calcium ion release was defective in cells lackingpolycystin-2 and reversed by exogenous expression of TRIC-B. Vice versa,exogenous polycystin-2 reversed an ER calcium-release defect in cells lackingTRIC-B. In a zebrafish model, expression of wild-type but not nonfunctionalTRIC-B suppressed polycystin-2-deficient phenotypes. Similarly, these phenotypes were suppressed by targeting the ROMK potassium channel (normally expressed onthe cell surface) to the ER. In cultured cells and polycystin-2-deficientzebrafish phenotypes, polycystin-2 remained capable of reversing the ER calciumrelease defect even when it was not present in the cilia. Transgenic expressionof Tric-b ameliorated cystogenesis in the kidneys of conditional Pkd2-inactivatedmice, whereas Tric-b deletion enhanced cystogenesis in Pkd2-heterozygous kidneys.CONCLUSIONS: Polycystin-2 in the ER appears to be critical for anticystogenesisand likely functions as a potassium ion channel to facilitate potassium-calciumcounterion exchange for inositol trisphosphate-mediated calcium release. Theresults advance the understanding of ADPKD pathogenesis and provides proof ofprinciple for pharmacotherapy by TRIC-B activators.

TI  - The Role of Vitamin D for Modulating the T Helper 1 Immune Response After theCoronavac Vaccination.
PG  - 329-335
LID - 10.1089/jir.2021.0218 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to observe the role of vitamin D levels with Thelper 1 (Th1)-type cytokines, such as interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) andinterleukin-12 (IL-12) efficacy, in those who had already received 2 injectionsof inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2)vaccines (CoronaVac). We also observed if these cytokines played any significancein the CoronaVac effectiveness for preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19)infection. One hundred ninety-four volunteers were monitored for 8 months uponreceiving 2 inactivated SARS-CoV2 vaccination injections (CoronaVac, Sinovac LifeSciences). The rate of confirmed Covid-19 infections was the primary outcome. Sixto 7 weeks after the second vaccine injection, and blood samples were obtained tomeasure the serum vitamin D, IFN-gamma, and IL-12 levels. Low vitamin D level wasdefined if vitamin D level <30 ng/mL. Subjects with low vitamin D had lowerIFN-gamma and IL-12 levels (P = 0.04 and P = 0.04, respectively). The receiveroperating characteristics curve analysis revealed that the area under curve forIFN-gamma was 0.59, whereas IL-12 was 0.59 for predicting the low vitamin Dlevels. During follow-up, a higher incidence of Covid-19 infections was observed in subjects with low IFN-gamma levels (P = 0.03). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the cumulative hazard of confirmed Covid-19 cases was increased in subjects with low IFN-gamma levels (log-rank test, P = 0.03). We concluded thatlower vitamin D level was correlated with a lower Th1 immune response, whereasthe adequate IFN-gamma level was required to obtain better CoronaVaceffectiveness.

AB  - Obligate symbiotic bacteria associated with the insects feeding exclusively onvertebrate blood are supposed to complement B vitamins presumably lacking intheir diet. Recent genomic analyses revealed considerable differences inbiosynthetic capacities across different symbionts, suggesting that levels of Bvitamins may vary across different vertebrate hosts. However, a rigorousdetermination of B vitamins content in blood of various vertebrates has not yetbeen approached. A reliable analytical method focused on B vitamin complex inblood can provide valuable informative background and understanding of generalprinciples of insect symbiosis. In this work, a chromatographic separation ofeight B vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine,biotin, folic acid, and cyanocobalamine), four B vitamin derivatives(niacinamide, pyridoxal-5-phosphate, 4-pyridoxic acid, and tetrahydrofolic acid),and 3 stable isotope labelled internal standards was developed. Detection wascarried out using dual-pressure linear ion trap mass spectrometer in FullScanMS/MS and SIM mode. Except for vitamin B9 (tetrahydrofolic acid), the instrument quantitation limits of all analytes were ranging from 0.42 to 5.0 mug/L,correlation coefficients from 0.9997 to 1.0000, and QC coefficients from 0.53 to 3.2%. Optimization of whole blood sample preparation step was focused especially on evaluation of two types of protein-precipitation agents: trichloroacetic acid and zinc sulphate in methanol. The best results were obtained for zinc sulphatein methanol, but only nine analytes were successfully validated. Accuracy of the procedure using this protein-precipitating agent was ranging from 89 to 120%,precision from 0.5 to 13%, and process efficiency from 65 to 108%. The content ofB vitamins in whole blood samples from human and various vertebrates is presentedas an application example of this newly developed method.

PG  - e0269466
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269466 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is associated withthromboembolism. Antiphospholipid antibody (APLa) formation is one of themechanisms. Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with thrombosis inantiphospholipid antibody syndrome. OBJECTIVE: Measure APLa and vitamin D inhospitalized COVID-19 patients with and without thrombosis to evaluate ifthromboembolism is associated with concomitant APLa and vitamin D deficiency.METHODS: Case-control study. Hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a thromboembolicevent (ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis/pulmonaryembolism, Cases n = 20). Controls (n = 20): Age, sex-matched withoutthromboembolic events. Patients with autoimmune disorders, antiphospholipidantibody syndrome, thrombophilia, anticoagulation therapy, prior thromboembolism,chronic kidney disease 3b, 4, end-stage renal disease, and malignancy wereexcluded. Given the limited current literature on the role of concomitantantiphospholipid antibodies and vitamin D deficiency in causing venous and/orarterial thrombosis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we enrolled 20 patients ineach arm. Anti-cardiolipin IgG/IgM, beta-2 glycoprotein-1 IgG/IgM, lupusanticoagulant and vitamin D levels were measured in both groups. RESULTS: Caseswere 5.7 times more likely to be vitamin D deficient (OR:5.7, 95% CI:1.3-25.6)and 7.4 times more likely to have any one APLa (OR:7.4, 95% CI: 1.6-49.5) whileaccounting for the effects of sex. Patients with both APLa and vitamin Ddeficiency had significantly more thrombosis compared to patients who wereantibody positive without vitamin D deficiency (100% vs 47.4%; p = 0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Thrombosis in COVID-19 was associated with concomitant APLa andvitamin D deficiency. Future studies in COVID-19 should assess the role ofvitamin D in reducing thrombosis.

PG  - 3-14
LID - 10.18087/cardio.2022.6.n2050 [doi]
AB  - Aim The aim of the study was evaluation of the effect of the coenzyme Q10 (Q10)treatment on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality of patients with chronicheart failure (CHF). Q-10 increases the electron transfer in the mitochondrialrespiratory chain and exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. Theseeffects improve the endothelial function and reduce afterload, which facilitates the heart pumping function. Patients with reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) (CHFrEF) have low Q10.Material and methods Criteria of inclusion inthe meta-analysis: 1) placebo-controlled studies; 2) enrollment of at least 100patients; 3) publications after 2010, which implies an optimal basic therapy for CHF; 4) duration of at least 6 months; 5) reported cardiovascular and/orall-cause mortality; 6) using sufficient doses of Q10 (&gt;100 mg/day). Thesearch was performed in CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, E-library, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. All-cause mortality was the primary efficacyendpoint in this systematic review and the meta-analysis. The secondary endpoint was cardiovascular mortality. Meta-analysis was performed according to theMantel-Haenszel methods. The Cochrane criterion (I2) was used for evaluation ofstatistical heterogeneity. The random effects model was used at I2>/=50 %,whereas the fixed effects model was used at I2&lt;50.Results Analysis of studies published from 01.01.2011 to 01.12.2021 identified 357 publications, 23 of which corresponded to the study topic, but only 6 (providing results of four randomizedclinical trials, RCT) completely met the predefined criteria. The final analysis included results of managing 1139 patients (586 received Q10 and 553 receivedplacebo). Risk of all-cause death was analyzed by data of four RCTs (1139patients). The decrease in the risk associated with the Q10 treatment was 36 %(OR=0.64, 95 % CI 0.48-0.87, small er, Cyrillic=0.004). The heterogeneity ofstudies was low (Chi2=0.84; p=0.84; I2=0 %). Risk of cardiovascular mortality wasanalyzed by data of two RCTs (863 patients). The decrease in the risk associated with the Q10 treatment was significant, 55% (OR=0.45, 95 % CI: 0.32-0.64, smaller, Cyrillic=0.00001). In this case, the data heterogeneity was also low(Chi2=0.41; p=0.52; I2=0 %).Conclusion The meta-analysis confirmed the beneficialeffect of coenzyme Q10 on the prognosis of patients with CHFrEF receiving therecommended basic therapy.

AB  - MAIN CONCLUSION: beta-carotene is biologically active compound widely distributedin plants. The use of plant in vitro cultures and genetic engineering is apromising strategy for its sustainable production. beta-carotene is an orangecarotenoid often found in leaves as well as in fruits, flowers, and roots. Amember of the tetraterpene family, this 40-carbon isoprenoid has a conjugateddouble-bond structure, which is responsible for some of its most remarkableproperties. In plants, beta-carotene functions as an antenna pigment andantioxidant, providing protection against photooxidative damage caused by strong UV-B light. In humans, beta-carotene acts as a precursor of vitamin A, preventsskin damage by solar radiation, and protects against several types of cancer suchas oral, colon and prostate. Due to its wide spectrum of applications, the globalmarket for beta-carotene is expanding, and the demand can no longer be met byextraction from plant raw materials. Considerable research has been dedicated to finding more efficient production alternatives based on biotechnological systems.This review provides a detailed overview of the strategies used to increase theproduction of beta-carotene in plant in vitro cultures, with particular focus on culture conditions, precursor feeding and elicitation, and the application ofmetabolic engineering.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association of coffeeconsumption rate with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, non-high-density lipoproteincholesterol levels, and total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterolratio in females with vitamin D deficiency. METHODS: This retrospectivecross-sectional study was carried out by studying the records of 270 Jordanianfemales aged 18-65 years with varying degrees of vitamin D deficiency. Following completion of the questionnaire regarding their anthropometric characteristicsand coffee consumption rate during the preceding 3 months, the participants were required to provide blood samples for analysis to measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D andlipid profile levels including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and totalcholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. RESULTS: The currentstudy demonstrated that coffee consumption rate and vitamin D deficiency weresignificantly positively connected with the total cholesterol to high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol ratio (p = .003) in women with vitamin D deficiency. Inaddition, vitamin D deficiency alone correlated positively with non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the total cholesterol to high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol ratio (p = .010) and (p = .002), respectively.CONCLUSION: Higher coffee consumption rate among women with vitamin D deficiency significantly elevated total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio that may increase woman's risk of hyperlipidemia.

LID - : 10.5005/japi-11001-0045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D plays an important role in bone and modulates mineralmetabolism and immune function with probable link to several chronic andinfectious conditions. In vivo studies have revealed that vitamin D deficiencyreduces insulin secretion capacity of the islet beta cells in pancreas. Severalstudies have shown a correlation between vitamin D levels and insulin resistance,nonetheless, extensive studies showing the relationship between the two arelacking especially among southern Indian population. So the present study wasaimed at evaluating the relationship between vitamin D and insulin resistance by using homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: In a cross-sectional study, 184 people among which 92 were diabetic and 92 were nondiabetic were recruited at RL Jalappa Hospital, Kolar in theDepartment of Medicine between May 2018 and April 2019. Fasting serum insulin(I0), fasting plasma glucose (G0), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C), renal function test,liver function test (LFT), lipid profile, and vitamin D levels were estimated.IBM SPSS version 22 was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence ofvitamin D deficiency in our study was (72) 78.2% among diabetic cases and (59)64.1% among the nondiabetic controls, with the diabetic cases showing lowerlevels of vitamin D than the controls, however, it was not statisticallysignificant. There was no significant difference in homeostatic modelassessment-beta-cell function (HOMA-B) and HOMA-IR between vitamin D deficientand nondeficient groups among cases and controls. CONCLUSION: Vitamin Ddeficiency is prevalent in both type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as well asnondiabetic. Furthermore, there is no association between vitamin D deficiencyand insulin resistance or beta-cell function.

PG  - 5479626
LID - 10.1155/2022/5479626 [doi]
AB  - Background: Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin disease with a multifactorial etiology. Recently, associations between serum homocysteine (Hcy) levels andinflammatory skin diseases, such as psoriasis and hidradenitis suppurativa, have been reported. However, no study has explored the levels of serum Hcy, folicacid, and vitamin B12 in patients with rosacea. Objective: To investigate serumHcy, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels in patients with papulopustular rosacea(PPR), we characterized the association of these levels with PPR severity.Methods: This case-control study included 138 PPR patients and 58 healthycontrols. The serum levels of Hcy, vitamin B12, and folic acid were measured. Acorrelation was assessed between disease severity and serum levels of Hcy,vitamin B12, and folic acid. Results: Serum vitamin B12 and folic acid levelswere significantly lower in PPR patients than in the healthy controls (p = 0.011 and p = 0.0173, respectively). Although serum Hcy levels did not significantlydiffer between PPR patients and healthy controls, PPR severity was positivelycorrelated with serum Hcy levels (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our results suggest a possible association between hyperhomocysteinemia and vitamin B12 deficiency inpatients with PPR.

TI  - Vitamin C Deficiency in Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
PG  - 890344
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2022.890344 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin C has been shown to play a significant role in suppressing progression ofleukemia through epigenetic mechanisms. We aimed to study the role of vitamin Cin acute myeloid leukemia (AML) biology and clinical course. To this purpose, theplasma levels of vitamin C at diagnosis in 62 patients with AML (including 5cases with acute promyelocytic leukemia, APL),7 with myelodysplastic syndrome(MDS), and in 15 healthy donors (HDs) were studied. As controls, vitamins A and Elevels were analysed. Expression of the main vitamin C transporters and of theTET2 enzyme were investigated by a specific RQ-PCR while cytoplasmic vitamin Cconcentration and its uptake were studied in mononuclear cells (MNCs),lymphocytes and blast cells purified from AML samples, and MNCs isolated fromHDs. There were no significant differences in vitamin A and E serum levelsbetween patients and HDs. Conversely, vitamin C concentration was significantlylower in AML as compared to HDs (p<0.0001), inversely correlated with peripheral blast-counts (p=0.029), significantly increased at the time of complete remission(CR) (p=0.04) and further decreased in resistant disease (p=0.002). Expression ofthe main vitamin C transporters SLC23A2, SLC2A1 and SLC2A3 was also significantlyreduced in AML compared to HDs. In this line, cytoplasmic vitamin C levels werealso significantly lower in AML-MNCs versus HDs, and in sorted blasts compared tonormal lymphocytes in individual patients. No association was found betweenvitamin C plasma levels and the mutation profile of AML patients, as well as whenconsidering cytogenetics or 2017 ELN risk stratification groups. Finally, vitaminC levels did not play a predictive role for overall or relapse-free survival. In conclusion, our study shows that vitamin C levels are significantly decreased in patients with AML at the time of initial diagnosis, further decrease duringdisease progression and return to normal upon achievement of CR. Correspondingly,low intracellular levels may mirror increased vitamin C metabolic consumption in proliferating AML cells.

AB  - Introduction: Damage to human skin occurs either chronologically or throughrepetitive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, where collagenphotodegradation leads to the formation of wrinkles and skin imperfections.Consequently, cosmeceutical products containing natural bioactives to restore or regenerate collagen have gained a remarkable attention as an ameliorative remedy.Methods: This study aimed to develop and optimize collagen-loaded water-in-oilnanoemulsion (W/O NE) through a D-optimal mixture design to achieve an idealmultifunctional nanosystem containing active constituents. Vit E was included as a constituent of the formulation for its antioxidant properties to minimize thedestructive impact of UV radiation. The formulated systems were characterized in terms of their globule size, optical clarity, and viscosity. An optimized system was selected and evaluated for its physical stability, in vitro wound healingproperties, and in vivo permeation and protection against UV radiation. Inaddition, the effect of collagen-loaded NE was compared to Vit C-loaded NE andcollagen-/Vit C-loaded NEs mixture as Vit C is known to enhance collagenproduction within the skin. Results: The optimized NE was formulated with 25%oils (Vit E: safflower oil, 1:3), 54.635% surfactant/cosurfactant (Span 80:Kolliphor EL: Arlasolve, 1:1:1), and 20.365% water. The optimized NE loaded with either collagen or Vit C exhibited a skin-friendly appearance with boostedpermeability, and improved cell viability and wound healing properties onfibroblast cell lines. Moreover, the in vivo study and histopathologicalinvestigations confirmed the efficacy of the developed system to protect the skinagainst UV damage. The results revealed that the effect of collagen-/Vit C-loadedNEs mixture was more pronounced, as both drugs reduced the skin damage to anextent that it was free from any detectable alterations. Conclusion: NEformulated using Vit E and containing collagen and/or Vit C could be a promising ameliorative remedy for skin protection against UVB irradiation.

TI  - Effects of Oral Multi-Vitamin Multi-Mineral Supplement Formulations on LaboratoryOutcomes and Quality of Life: A Quasi-Experimental Study.
PG  - 889910
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.889910 [doi]
AB  - Background: Multi-vitamin multi-mineral (MVMM) products often come in severalsingle-substance capsules from different manufacturers. However, attempts to mix several vitamins and minerals into one MVMM product have been complicated andoften involve legal concerns. This study aimed to comparatively investigate thechanges in laboratory parameters and the quality of life (QOL) among individuals who received different MVMM formulations. Methods: This three-arm non-randomized controlled trial was conducted at VitalLife Scientific Wellness Center (VSWC),Bangkok, Thailand. A total of 72 healthy adult individuals with total serum25-(OH)D level of 20-29 ng/ml were invited to choose from the three availableoptions, namely, (1) Hydro-Cell-Key (HCK(R), Hepart AG, Switzerland) containsvitamin D3 2,000 IU, vitamin C 1,000 mg, vitamin E 166 mg, vitamin A 1 mg,coenzyme Q10 30 mg, natural carotenoids 8 mg, and citrus flavonoids 200 mg ingranule formulation; (2) VTL-7 (VWSC) contains similar vitamins and minerals but in capsule formulation; and (3) placebo capsule (no supplement). The 36-ItemShort-Form Health Survey (SF-36) was used to measure QOL at baseline, month 3 and6. A generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used to compare therepeated-measure outcomes across the three groups. This study was registered atthe Thai Clinical Trial Registration (TCTR20190205002) and approved by theBumrungrad International Institutional Review Board (BI-IRB No.258-10-18PhFub).Results: Both VTL-7 and HCK saw a significantly higher increase in vitamin D thanplacebo at months 3 and 6, i.e., VTL-7 from 25.15 +/- 2.13 to 35.53 +/- 6.11 (p <0.001) and 33.38 +/- 6.89 (p < 0.001); HCK from 24.25 +/- 3.08 to 28.43 +/- 5.93 (p = 0.005) and 27.40 +/- 5.24 (p = 0.012); and placebo from 24.00 +/- 2.73 to23.05 +/- 4.39 (p = 0.273) and 22.30 +/- 6.23 (p = 0.200), respectively.Similarly, beta-carotenoids of VTL-7 vs. HCK groups significantly increased from 0.88 +/- 0.68 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.55 at baseline to 3.03 +/- 1.79 (p < 0.001) vs. 1.09+/- 0.61 (p = 0.125) and 3.26 +/- 1.74 (p < 0.001) vs. 1.15 +/- 0.66 (p = 0.064),respectively. These findings were corroborated through the GEE analysis. Othermicronutrients at months 3 and 6 did not increase significantly from baseline in any group. The overall QOL among the three groups in terms of physical (p =0.560) and mental (p = 0.750) health increased but was not statisticallysignificant. Conclusion: The supplements of MVMM in capsule formulation increasedthe serum levels of some micronutrients to a higher extent than that of granuleformulation. Participant adherence remains a potential confounder and should befurther explored. Clinical Trial Registration: identifier: TCTR20190205002.

PG  - 58-67
LID - 10.1900/RDS.2022.18.58 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate vitamin D ((25OH)D levels) deficiency as a possible cause in the development of DT1 in children and adolescents aged 0-15. METHODS: Wesearched PubMed/ Medline, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library to identify potentiallyeligible articles that examine whether low serum 25(OH)D levels are associatedwith subsequent development of DT1. All type of research designs, includingrandomized and non-randomized controlled trials, prospective and retrospectivecohort studies, case- control and cross-sectional studies with subjects aged</=15 years old were consider for inclusion. RESULTS: Seven original studies met the entry criteria. Most of these studies found up to 50% lower levels of vitaminD in children with DT1 compared to control group and a significant positiveassociation between vitamin D levels and of the risk of developing DT1. Resultsof quality assessment demonstrated moderate to high quality of all the studiesincluded. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D deficiency may be a possible cause in thedevelopment of DT1 in the early years of life and particularly in children withgenetic predisposition, whilst the deficiency of vitamin D is a very commonoccurrence in patients with DT1. Further long-term studies on children arerequired to determine the role of vitamin D on DT1.

TI  - Effect of vitamin B6 on pain, disease severity, and psychological profile offibromyalgia patients; a randomized, double-blinded clinical trial.
PG  - 664
LID - 10.1186/s12891-022-05637-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the role of vitamin B6 on pronociceptive/antinociceptiveneurotransmitters balance, metabolic reactions, and inflammation, it is importantto clarify the effect of vitamin B6 on pain and psychological disturbance infibromyalgia (FM). This study aimed to evaluate whether an 80-mg daily dose ofvitamin B6 improves pain, disease severity and psychological symptoms of FMcompared to a placebo. METHODS: This randomized, double-blinded,placebo-controlled trial was performed on the FM patients whose diagnosis wasconfirmed by a rheumatologist based on the 2016 American College of Rheumatology (ACR). 90 Patients were randomized to receive either vitamin B6 (80 mg daily) or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, with a permuted block size of 30 stratified by diseaseseverity. Primary outcomes included the Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire(FIQR), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 12-item short-form healthsurvey (SF-12), and pain visual analog scale (pain-VAS)). The mean differences inoutcomes (before and after treatment) were compared between the vitamin B6 andplacebo groups using an independent T-test. An ANCOVA model adjusted for baselineoutcome value was also provided to compare the outcomes between the two groups.RESULTS: Of 90 eligible patients, 60 patients (31 patients in vitamin B6 and 29in the placebo group) completed the trial. Overall, the FIQR, pain-VAS, andHADS-anxiety scores improved after treatment in both vitamin B6 and placebogroups; However, there was no statistically significant intergroup differenceregarding primary outcomes. ANCOVA model also showed no difference in thetreatment effects. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed no priority for vitamin B6over placebo in FM patients. Considering the potential ameliorating role ofvitamin B6 on pain and psychological symptoms, acknowledgment of vitamin B6 as a relatively safe adjuvant treatment needs larger future studies.

TI  - Alpha Tocopherol Loaded Polymeric Nanoparticles: Preparation, Characterizations, and In Vitro Assessments Against Oxidative Stress in Spinal Cord InjuryTreatment.
PG  - 195
LID - 10.1208/s12249-022-02345-2 [doi]
AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is characterized by mechanical injury or trauma to thespinal cord. Currently, SCI treatment requires extremely high doses ofneuroprotective agents, which in turn, causes several adverse effects. Toovercome these limitations, the present study focuses on delivery of a low buteffective dose of a naturally occurring antioxidant, alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TP).Calcium alginate nanoparticles (CA-NP) and poly D,L-lactic-co-glycolic acidnanoparticles (PLGA-NP) prepared by ionotropic gelation and solvent evaporationtechnique had particle size of 21.9 +/- 11.19 and 152.4 +/- 10.6 nm,respectively. Surface morphology, surface charge, as well as particle sizedistribution of both nanoparticles were evaluated. Entrapment of alpha-TP intoCA-NP and PLGA-NP quantified by UPLC showed entrapment efficiency of 4.00 +/-1.63% and 76.6 +/- 11.4%, respectively. In vitro cytotoxicity profiles on humanastrocyte-spinal cord (HA-sp) showed that blank CA-NP at high concentrationsreduced the cell viability whereas blank PLGA-NP showed relatively safercytotoxic profiles. In addition, PLGA nanoparticles encapsulated with alpha-TP(alpha-TP-PLGA-NP) in comparison to alpha-TP alone at high concentrations wereless toxic. Pretreatment of HA-sp cells with alpha-TP-PLGA-NP showed two-foldhigher anti-oxidative protection as compared to alpha-TP alone, when oxidativestress was induced by H2O2. In conclusion, CA-NP were found to be unsuitable for treatment of SCI due to their cytotoxicity. Comparatively, alpha-TP-PLGA-NP were safer and showed high degree of protection against oxidative stress than alpha-TPalone.

PG  - 11861
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-15739-w [doi]
AB  - Vascular calcification is a risk factor for cardiovascular and kidney diseases.Medial calcification may differently affect the arterial tree depending on vessellocation and smooth muscle injury. The aim was to map the anatomical distributionof vascular calcifications on different arteries and artery locations, incultured artery rings (ex vivo) and in a rat model of elastocalcinosis (in vivo).Vascular calcification was assessed histologically (von Kossa staining of themedia) and by calcium content measurement. Arteries of different sizes wereharvested from untreated rats for ring culture and from the vitamin D3-nicotine(VDN) rat model for direct observation. When cultured in pro-calcifyingconditions, thoracic aorta exhibited similar calcification from the arch to thediaphragm. Calcification increased in abdominal aorta along with the reduction incross sectional area. Carotid and renal arteries exhibited similar ex vivocalcification. In VDN rats, calcification was greater in carotid artery than inaorta, and was accompanied by fibrosis and apoptosis. Ex vivo, calcification was increased by the induction of lesions on arteries. Along the vascular tree,calcification of the arterial wall increases with the narrowing of vessels in ex vivo ring culture and in vivo. The observed differences represent localsusceptibility of the vessels to the calcifying processes.

TI  - The impact of vitamin D on the onset and progress of Kawasaki disease.
PG  - e15191
LID - 10.1111/ped.15191 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The seasonal epidemic of Kawasaki disease (KD) in winter in Japansuggests that low vitamin D status may affect KD through the immune system. Weaimed to evaluate the effect of vitamin D on the onset and clinical course of KD.METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to compare 25-hydroxyvitamin D(25(OH)D) levels in KD patients admitted to our hospital between March 2018 andJune 2021, with those in healthy controls from published Japanese data. Inpatients with KD, we evaluated the association of 25(OH)D levels with intravenousimmunoglobulin resistance and coronary artery lesions. RESULTS: We compared 290controls and 86 age-group-adjusted patients with KD. The 25(OH)D levels in KDpatients were lower than those in the controls (median: 17 vs. 29 ng/mL, P <0.001). In winter, 25(OH)D levels in KD patients were lower than those in summer (median: 13 vs. 19 ng/mL). The adjusted odds ratios for the onset of KD were 4.9 (95% CI: 2.5-9.6) for vitamin D insufficiency (25(OH)D: 12-20 ng/mL) and 29.4(95% CI: 12.5-78.2) for vitamin D deficiency (25(OH)D < 12 ng/mL). Among 110 KDpatients, 25(OH)D levels at diagnosis of KD were not associated with intravenous immunoglobulin resistance or coronary artery lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The 25(OH)Dlevels in patients with KD were lower than those in the controls, especially inwinter. Lower 25(OH)D levels in winter were associated with an increased risk of KD onset. It remains to be elucidated whether the observed association has acausal relationship.

TI  - Neoadjuvant Radiotherapy After (m)FOLFIRINOX for Borderline Resectable PancreaticAdenocarcinoma: A TAPS Consortium Study.
PG  - 783-791.e1
LID - 10.6004/jnccn.2022.7008 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: The value of neoadjuvant radiotherapy (RT) after 5-fluorouracil with leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, with or without dose modifications[(m)FOLFIRINOX], for patients with borderline resectable (BR) pancreatic ductaladenocarcinoma (PDAC) is uncertain. METHODS: We conducted an internationalretrospective cohort study including consecutive patients with BR PDAC whoreceived (m)FOLFIRINOX as initial treatment (2012-2019) from the Trans-AtlanticPancreatic Surgery Consortium. Because the decision to administer RT is madeafter chemotherapy, patients with metastases or deterioration after (m)FOLFIRINOXor a performance score >/=2 were excluded. Patients who received RT after(m)FOLFIRINOX were matched 1:1 by nearest neighbor propensity scores withpatients who did not receive RT. Propensity scores were calculated using sex, age(</=70 vs >70 years), WHO performance score (0 vs 1), tumor size (0-20 vs 21-40vs >40 mm), tumor location (head/uncinate vs body/tail), number of cycles (1-4 vs5-8 vs >8), and baseline CA 19-9 level (</=500 vs >500 U/mL). Primary outcome wasoverall survival (OS) from diagnosis. RESULTS: Of 531 patients who receivedneoadjuvant (m)FOLFIRINOX for BR PDAC, 424 met inclusion criteria and 300 (70.8%)were propensity score-matched. After matching, median OS was 26.2 months (95% CI,24.0-38.4) with RT versus 32.8 months (95% CI, 25.3-42.0) without RT (P=.71). RT was associated with a lower resection rate (55.3% vs 72.7%; P=.002). In patients who underwent a resection, RT was associated with a comparable margin-negativeresection rate (>1 mm) (70.6% vs 64.8%; P=.51), more node-negative disease (57.3%vs 37.6%; P=.01), and more major pathologic response with <5% tumor viability(24.7% vs 8.3%; P=.006). The OS associated with conventional and stereotacticbody RT approaches was similar (median OS, 25.7 vs 26.0 months; P=.92).CONCLUSIONS: In patients with BR PDAC, neoadjuvant RT following (m)FOLFIRINOX wasassociated with more node-negative disease and better pathologic response inpatients who underwent resection, yet no difference in OS was found. Routine use of RT cannot be recommended based on these data.

AB  - Vitamin-D deficiency is a global issue and a food fortification strategy mayreduce deficiency levels. Mixed micelles (MM) are crucial to vitamin-D absorptionin vivo and may enhance vitamin-D food fortification. This study compared theability of MM based delivery systems to oil-in-water emulsions to improvevitamin-D bioaccessibility in vitro. Vitamin-D loaded emulsions were formed with olive or coconut oil alone or with added l-alpha-phosphatidylcholine, as well as two MM based systems. Particle size throughout digestion, fatty acid release, andvitamin-D bioaccessibility were measured. After digestion, particles in the MMsize range ( approximately 6-10 nm) were observed for emulsions but not for MMbased systems. The bioaccessibility of vitamin-D in olive and coconut emulsionswas 75% and 78%, respectively, and approximately 90% with addedl-alpha-phosphatidylcholine. Bioaccessibility for the MM alone was 93% and 90%when mixed with a protein/lactose base. Overall, MM show good potential as adelivery system for vitamin-D in vitro.

TI  - Repeated High-Fluence Accelerated Slitlamp-Based Photoactivated Chromophore forKeratitis Corneal Cross-Linking for Treatment-Resistant Fungal Keratitis.
PG  - 1058-1061
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000002973 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report a case of fungal keratitisresistant to standard-of-care antimicrobial treatment and successful resolution, thanks to the repeated high-fluence accelerated photoactivated chromophore forkeratitis-corneal cross-linking (PACK-CXL). METHODS: This was a case report.RESULTS: A 79-year-old male patient with previous Descemet membrane endothelialkeratoplasty presented with a corneal ulcer that was resistant to topicalantimicrobial therapy and amniotic membrane placement. Fungal keratitis wasdiagnosed, and the cornea was on the verge of perforation. After over a month of topical and systemic therapy without marked improvement, the patient underwent 2 repeated high-fluence accelerated CXL procedures (7.2 J/cm2 using a UVirradiation of 30 mW/cm2 for 4 minutes) over an interval of 8 days (accumulatedfluence of 14.4 J/cm2), which resulted in significant clinical improvement, with consolidation into a quiescent scar. CONCLUSIONS: PACK-CXL protocols delivering atotal UV fluence of 5.4 J/cm2 (as per the original Dresden protocol for cornealectasia cross-linking) can be an effective primary therapy for initial orsuperficial corneal infections because approximately half of the energy isabsorbed in the first 100 mum of a riboflavin-soaked cornea. However, fungalkeratitis may require higher fluences than 5.4 J/cm2 because, unlike ectaticcorneas, corneal ulcers are not transparent, and the infection may involve deepstroma. This case illustrates how repeated high-fluence accelerated PACK-CXL can be used to successfully treat fungal keratitis resistant to conventional topical and systemic medications.

AB  - Evaluate the effect of ascorbic acid application and coexistence of Mycorrhizafungus and Azospirillium on basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) under drought stress.This experiment was performed as a split factorial in a randomized complete blockdesign with three replications in the crop year 2017-2018 in Shahriar, Iran. Inthis experiment, irrigation was the main factor in three levels, includingdrought stress based on 40-70-100 mm from the evaporation pan of class A.Biofertilizer including growth-promoting bacteria (Azospirillium) and mycorrhiza fungus in four levels, including a(Non-consumption) B (Seeds of growth-promoting bacteria (Azospirillium)) C (Consumption of mycorrhiza fungus as seeds) D(Concomitant use of growth-promoting bacteria Azospirillium with mycorrhiza fungias seeds) and ascorbic acid in two levels of foliar application, including A(Absence Application of ascorbic acid) and B (Application of ascorbic acid (twodays after irrigation treatment)) was considered as a factorial factor. Theresults showed that the highest biological yield was obtained in drought stressof 40 mm and application of biological fertilizers in the form of mycorrhizaapplication with an average of 3307.1 kg/ha, which was about 70% more than 100 mmevaporation stress and no application of biological fertilizer. The use ofascorbic acid under drought stress conditions improved by 10%, the essential oil using ascorbic acid evaporated under drought stress conditions of 100 mm. As ageneral conclusion, the use of ascorbic acid and Mycorrhiza + Azospirilliumbiological fertilizer improved the quantitative and qualitative characteristicsof basil under drought stress.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are one of the most prescribed drugs inthe world. Frequent use and long-term maintenance of these drugs drew theattention of researchers for sporadic adverse effects reports. OBJECTIVE: Thepurpose of this narrative review is to discuss appropriate data and causalityrelated to these adverse events and PPIs. METHODS: A narrative review wasconducted by systematizing information about safety and adverse events on PPIsfrom 2015 to 2020. A structured search on Pubmed was performed to identifysystematic reviews and meta-analysis investigating the following situations: a)gastric cancer; b) micronutrients deficiency; c) acid rebound; d) infections; e) fractures; f) dementia; g) kidney disease; and h) sudden death and cardiovascularchanges. RESULTS: Recent studies have potentially associated PPIs with someadverse events as osteoporosis-related fractures. There are also reports ofintestinal infections, including Clostridium difficile, besides poor vitaminsabsorption and minerals such as vitamin B12, magnesium, and iron. Furthermore,there are some dementia, pneumonia, kidney disease, myocardial infarction, andstroke reports. For kidney diseases, studies consistently suggest that the use ofPPI may be associated with an increased risk of adverse kidney events, especiallyin the elderly, with long-term PPI use and pre-existing kidney disease. Anotheradditional question is whether chronic PPI use would also lead to the onset ofgastric cancer. The abrupt discontinuation of PPIs is also related to increasedgastric acid production above pre-PPI treatment levels; this phenomenon is calledacid rebound. CONCLUSION: The key to mitigate adverse effects is the rational useof PPIs at the lowest effective dose and in the shortest possible duration.Although these adverse effects have a potential clinical impact, their causalassociation is still subject to validation.

AB  - This research aimed to investigate the effects of the intramuscular injection of vitamins AD3E and C in combination immediately before the estrus synchronization program (the Ovsynch program) on conception and pregnancy rates, bloodparameters, serum biochemical properties, immune systems, antioxidant parameters,and proteomic and transcriptomic analyses during early gestation in dairy cows.Forty nonlactating multiparous cows were randomly assigned to one of fourtreatments: (1) C: control with normal saline injection; (2) VAD3E: a singleintramuscular injection (I/M) of vitamin AD3E; (3) VAD3EC: injection of bothvitamins AD3E and C; (4) VC: a single dose of vitamin C. Blood and serum samples were taken immediately at day 0 (before AI), day 7, and day 14 (after AI for 5days) from the coccygeal vein. Generally, injections of AD3E and C in combinationhad no effect on the rate of conception or pregnancy. However, they improvedhematological parameters and immune and antioxidant activities. Serum sampleswere analyzed using LC-MS/MS, and 8190 proteins were identified. Five proteinswere successfully validated using the quantitative real-time reversetranscription PCR (qRT-PCR) method. This study found that lymphocyte-specificprotein 1 (LSP1, A0A3Q1M894) could be used as a protein biomarker for cowsadministrated with vitamins AD3E and C.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Considering how vitamin B12 or cobalamin affects the immune system,especially inflammation and the formation of the myelin sheath, it appears as acomplementary therapy for MS by affecting some signaling pathways. Recentlydiagnosed MS patients were divided into two groups (n=30). One group receivedinterferon-beta (IFN-beta or Avonex), and another received IFN-beta+B12 for sixmonths. Blood samples were taken before and after treatments. Interleukin (IL)-10and osteopontin (OPN) levels in the plasma were determined by the enzyme-linkedimmunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, and the expression of microRNA (miR)-106a,miR-299a, and miR-146a by real-time PCR. IFN-beta neither changed the IL-10plasma levels nor miR106a and miR-299a expression, but it led to a remarkabledecrease in OPN concentration and enhancement in let-7c and miR-146a expression. There was a significant decrease in IL-10, OPN plasma levels, miR-106aexpression, and a substantial increase in let-7c and miR-146a expression inIFN-beta+B12, treated group. There was no correlation between IL-10 and OPN with related miRNAs in the two treatment groups. Our study indicated that B12 could bea complementary treatment in MS that may influence the disease improvement.

PG  - 323-328
LID - 10.1080/00365513.2022.2092898 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: For diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency, plasma methylmalonic acid(P-MMA) is considered superior to plasma vitamin B12 (P-B12). Reduced kidneyfunction elevates P-MMA, hence, hampering P-MMA as a biomarker. We assessedwhether correcting P-MMA for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) canaffect the estimated prevalence of B12 deficiency. Methods: We included 115,245patients with concomitant measurements of P-MMA, P-B12 and P-Creatinine. B12deficiency was classified using P-MMA decision limits at >0.75 and >0.43micromol/L. The non-linear relation between eGFR and P-MMA was estimated usingspline regression. We calculated the percentage-wise reclassification of B12deficiency by using an eGFR corrected P-MMA formula with eGFR reference points of90 and 60 mL/min. Results: 6% with B12 deficiency were reclassified asnon-deficient after adjusting for eGFR (reference point eGFR 90 mL/min) with bothP-MMA decision limits. Overall B12 deficiency prevalence was reduced from 9.6% to9.0% (P-MMA decision limit 0.43 micromol/L). With P-MMA decision limits at 0.75and 0.43 micromol/L, 33.6% and 44.8% of B12 deficient patients with an eGFR <60mL/min were reclassified as non-deficient. Conclusions: We have demonstrated thatcorrecting P-MMA for eGFR can reclassify P-MMA levels across decision limits for diagnosing B12 deficiency, in particular for patients with reduced kidneyfunction. This may have clinical implications for avoiding overdiagnosis of this chronic disease.

PG  - 3000605221110697
LID - 10.1177/03000605221110697 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The UGT1A1*28 polymorphism reduces UGT1A1 enzymatic activity, whichmay increase the risk of severe toxicity in patients who receive standard-doseirinotecan, such as severe neutropenia and diarrhea. This real-world studyassessed the optimal irinotecan dose in terms of efficacy and toxicity inmetastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients homozygous for the UGT1A1*28polymorphism and receiving FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab or cetuximab as first-linetherapy. METHODS: We analyzed toxicity and treatment outcomes in seven mCRCpatients who were homozygous for UGT1A1*28 and received FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab or cetuximab, with an initial irinotecan dose of 120 mg/m(2). RESULTS: Six of theseven patients tolerated 120 mg/m(2) irinotecan without requiring dose reductionsin subsequent cycles. The overall response and disease control rates were 43.0%(3/7) and 71.4% (5/7), respectively. The median progression-free survival andoverall survival were 11.0 and 33.0 months, respectively. Only one severe adverseevent, grade III neutropenia (2.5%), was observed. CONCLUSIONS: mCRC patientshomozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele can tolerate irinotecan at an initial dose of120 mg/m(2) with favorable oncological outcomes and toxicity profiles. Furtherprospective studies are warranted to optimize irinotecan-based chemotherapy inthese patients.

AB  - Background: Although it is generally agreed that vitamin D is important for bone health, the role of vitamin D in preventing fractures in children and adolescentsremains unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prevalence ofvitamin D deficiency and insufficiency in healthy Korean children with fractures.Our secondary aim was to compare serum vitamin D levels before and during thecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Methods: We evaluated 334 patients with fractures who were surgically treated at our institution between 2018 and2019 before the onset of COVID-19 (group I). In addition, we collected data onthe serum 25(OH)D levels of 210 patients who visited our pediatric department forevaluation of short stature (group II) and the serum 25(OH)D levels of thepatients with fractures during the COVID-19 pandemic period (group III). A serum 25(OH)D level of <20 ng/mL was considered deficient, between 20 and 32 ng/mL was insufficient, and >/=32 ng/mL was considered sufficient. Results: The mean agewas 8.1 +/- 3.5 years in group I, 8.2 +/- 3.7 years in group II, and 8.6 +/- 3.5 years in group III. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 53.0% in group Iand 32.9% in group II. The mean serum 25(OH)D level was lower in group I than in group II (20.0 +/- 7.3 ng/ml vs. 23.2 +/- 6.9 ng/ml, p < 0.001). The mean serum25(OH)D level of younger patients (<10 years) in group III was lower than that ofthe younger patients in the prepandemic period (21.4 +/- 7.2 ng/mL vs. 19.2 +/-6.8 ng/mL, p=0.037). Conclusions: We observed a high prevalence of vitamin Ddeficiency/insufficiency in children with fractures who required surgicaltreatment. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the serum vitamin D levels became evenlower, especially in younger children.

PG  - 4977-4994
LID - 10.1007/s00253-022-12063-1 [doi]
AB  - Vine shoots and surplus grape must were assessed as feedstocks for succinic acid production with Actinobacillus succinogenes and Basfia succiniproducens. Afteracidic and enzymatic hydrolysis, vine shoots released 35-40 g/L total sugars.Both bacterial species produced 18-21 g/L succinic acid from this hydrolysate in 120 h. Regarding grape must fermentation, A. succinogenes clearly outperformed B.succiniproducens. Yeast extract (a source of organic nitrogen and vitamins) wasthe only additional nutrient needed by A. succinogenes to grow on grape must.Under mathematically optimized conditions (145.7 g/L initial sugars and 24.9 g/L yeast extract), A. succinogenes generated 88.9 +/- 1.4 g/L succinic acid in 96 h,reaching a succinic acid yield of 0.66 +/- 0.01 g/g and a sugar consumption of96.64 +/- 0.30%. Substrate inhibition was not observed in grape musts with125-150 g/L initial sugars, provided that an adequate amount of yeast extract wasavailable for bacteria. Alternative nitrogen sources to yeast extract (red winelees, white wine lees, urea, NH4Cl, and choline chloride) were not suitable forA. succinogenes in grape must. KEY POINTS: * Vine shoots and surplus grape mustwere assessed for succinic acid bioproduction. * Succinic acid bioproduction was 21 g/L with vine shoots and 89 g/L with grape must. * Fermentation was efficient at high sugar loads if organic N supply was adequate.

TI  - Association of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels with the gut microbiotaand metabolites in postmenopausal women in China.
PG  - 137
LID - 10.1186/s12934-022-01858-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency is associated with an alteredmicrobiota in older men. However, the relationship between the gut microbiota and25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels remains unknown in postmenopausal women. In this study, fecal microbiota profiles for 88 postmenopausal women in the high25(OH)D (HVD) group (n = 44) and the low 25(OH)D (LVD) group (n = 44) weredetermined. An integrated 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-massspectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics approach was applied to explore theassociation of serum 25(OH)D levels with the gut microbiota and fecal metabolicphenotype. Adjustments were made using several statistical models for potentialconfounding variables identified from the literature. RESULTS: The resultsdemonstrated that the community diversity estimated by the Observe, Chao1 and ACEindexes was significantly lower in the LVD group than in the HVD group.Additionally, two kinds of characteristic differences in the microflora wereanalyzed in the HVD group, and ten kinds of characteristic differences in themicroflora were analyzed in the LVD group. We observed that some bacteriabelonging to the genera Bifidobacterium, Bacillus, F0332 and Gemella, wereenriched in the LVD group, as were other genera, including Lachnoclostridium,UC5_1_2E3, Ruminococcus_gnavus_group and un_f_Lachnospiraceae.Christensenellaceae, Eggerthellaceae and Cloacibacillus were enriched in the HVD group. The L-pyroglutamic acid, inosine, and L-homocysteic acid levels werehigher in the HVD group and were negatively correlated with the1,2-benzenedicarboxylic acid and cholic acid metabolic levels. CONCLUSIONS: Theseobservations provide a better understanding of the relationships between serum25(OH)D levels and the fecal microbiota and metabolites in postmenopausal women.

PG  - 4995-5006
LID - 10.1007/s00253-022-12073-z [doi]
AB  - The influences of three wheat gluten peptides (WGP-LL, WGP-LML, and WGP-LLL) onthe osmotic stress tolerance and membrane lipid component in brewer's yeast were investigated. The results demonstrated that the growth and survival of yeastunder osmotic stress were enhanced by WGP supplementation. The addition of WGPupregulated the expressions of OLE1 (encoded the delta-9 fatty acid desaturase)and ERG1 (encoded squalene epoxidase) genes under osmotic stress. At the sametime, WGP addition enhanced palmitoleic acid (C16:1) content, unsaturated fattyacids/saturated fatty acids ratio, and the amount of ergosterol in yeast cellsunder osmotic stress. Furthermore, yeast cells in WGP-LL and WGP-LLL groups were more resistant to osmotic stress. WGP-LL and WGP-LLL addition caused 25.08% and27.02% increase in membrane fluidity, 22.36% and 29.54% reduction in membranepermeability, 18.38% and 14.26% rise in membrane integrity in yeast cells,respectively. In addition, scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed thatthe addition of WGP was capable of maintaining yeast cell morphology and reducingcell membrane damage under osmotic stress. Thus, alteration of membrane lipidcomponent by WGP was an effective approach for increasing the growth and survivalof yeast cells under osmotic stress. KEY POINTS: *WGP addition enhanced cellgrowth and survival of yeast under osmotic stress. *WGP addition increasedunsaturated fatty acids and ergosterol contents in yeast. *WGP supplementationimproved membrane homeostasis in yeast at osmotic stress.

TI  - Relationship between Lymphocyte Subpopulations and Vitamin D Levels in COVID-19Pneumonia Patients.
PG  - 433-438
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some studies have shown that patients who are hospitalized withsevere COVID-19 also have low levels of vitamin D. It is known that vitamin D canreduce the risk of infections and down regulate the immune/inflammatory reaction.OBJECTIVES: To investigate the association between vitamin D status andlymphocyte subpopulations in hospitalized pneumonia COVID-19 patients. METHODS:In 33 positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)patients with radiologic evidence of interstitial pneumonia and in 16 healthycontrol subjects matched for age, sex, and seasonality lymphocyte subpopulations and vitamin D levels were evaluated. RESULTS: The majority of patients withCOVID-19 pneumonia (70.8%) presented vitamin D deficiency. The percentages ofneutrophils presented a negative correlation (r = -0.74; P < 0.001), whereas the percentages of lymphocytes presented a positive correlation (r = 0.43; P < 0.01) with 25(OH)D. Moreover, vitamin D levels were positively correlated with CD3+ (r = 0.37, P < 0.05), CD4+ (r = 0.41, P < 0.05), CD8+ (r = 0.32, P < 0.07), andCD19+ (r = 0.38, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study confirms the highprevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and thatvitamin D deficiency is associated with a reduction of lymphocyte subsets andaltered T-lymphocyte activation. This finding may contribute to clarify themechanisms by which vitamin D influences the course and outcome of COVID-19pneumonia.

AB  - B-vitamins act as enzymatic co-factors in immune functions, therefore they areconsidered to reduce chemotherapy-induced side effects in cancer patients. Weconducted a systematic search, screening five electronic databases (Embase,Cochrane, PsychInfo, CINAHL and Medline) to find studies on the effectiveness andpotential harm of B-vitamin therapy on cancer patients. Out of the 7465 searchresults, 11 RCTs about vitamin B6, B12 and B-vitamins in combination wereincluded in this systematic review. A total of 1546 patients with diverse typesof cancer were evaluated. Overall, most studies were of acceptable quality andreported consistent results. Studies examining the effectiveness of vitamin B6reported that there is no significant impact on decreasing the incidence andseverity of chemotherapy-induced side effects (e.g., hand-foot syndrome), thenecessity of chemotherapy dose-modifications or improving patients' quality oflife, tumor response/progression, and overall survival. Two studies reported thatvitamin B12 could be effective in the alleviation of symptoms resulting fromchemotherapy; it might decrease motor, sensory and pain symptoms of peripheralneuropathy. However, a combination of B vitamins may not reduce the incidence of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. All in all, the evidence onB-vitamins in cancer patients is low and supplementation cannot be recommended.

TI  - The role of well-known antioxidant vitamins in the prevention of cadmium-induced toxicity.
LID - 146093 [pii]
LID - 10.13075/ijomeh.1896.01912 [doi]
AB  - Long-term exposure to cadmium (Cd) leads to the development of a number ofconditions associated with liver and kidney damage, reproductive andcardiovascular disorders, in addition to visual impairment, blindness and hearingloss, among others. Cadmium has been classified as a human carcinogen by theInternational Agency for Research on Cancer. The toxicity of Cd is related to itspro-oxidant properties and the associated increase in oxidative stress.Antioxidant ingredients may be helpful in preventing the adverse effects of Cd.The effect of well-known antioxidant vitamins (E, C, A and beta-carotene) in the prevention of Cd-induced toxicity is presented in this study. Numerous studies inanimal models have shown that the effects of vitamins: E, C, A, and beta-carotenewere effective in reducing Cd concentrations in organs and tissues and reducedCd-induced changes in liver, kidney, and reproductive, circulatory, nervous,immune, and respiratory systems. In contrast, the limited number of human studiesdoes not allow to accurately determine the role of these nutrients in reducingCd-induced toxicity, indicating the need for further studies clarifying the role of antioxidant vitamins in reducing Cd-induced toxicity. However, it seemsreasonable to promote the consumption of natural food products that are sourcesof antioxidant vitamins in groups of people with occupational and environmentalexposure to Cd.

TI  - Comparisons of Characteristics and Nutritional Inadequacies in Indonesian OlderAdults Consuming or Refraining from Dairy Products.
PG  - 255-265
AB  - BACKGROUND: Milk consumption in the Indonesian elderly population is among thelowest in the world, and two-thirds of the population are lactose intolerant.This might have an impact on energy and nutrient intakes. However, data on theprevalence of nutrient intake inadequacies in dairy users versus non-dairy users,as well as population characteristics, are lacking. Therefore we obtained datacomparing nutritional inadequacies and characteristics of Indonesian older adultsconsuming or refraining from dairy products. METHODS: A cross-sectional study wasconducted in 2021 as a part of the INA LACTASE study, involving 194community-dwelling older adults in the outpatient geriatric clinic at Dr. CiptoMangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, Indonesia. We collected data on demographic andclinical characteristics as part of a routinely performed comprehensive geriatricassessment. A structured questionnaire was developed to categorize participantsas dairy-or non-dairy users based on habitual dairy intake. Food records werecollected to assess nutrient intakes. The prevalence of inadequacies of energy,macronutrients, and a selection of micronutrients (calcium, vitamin D, andvitamin B12) was calculated by comparing the reported mean intakes to therecommended dietary intakes of the Indonesian population (Indonesian RDA).Prevalence ratios were calculated to measure the association between dairyproduct consumption and the prevalence of nutrient inadequacies. RESULTS: Werecruited 194 eligible participants. This study found that dairy users had ahigher proportion of women, a higher monthly income, but a lower proportion ofhypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidaemia in older adults consumingdairy products. We observed wide variability in energy and nutrient intakes, aswell as a high prevalence of inadequacies for all dietary intake parameters,particularly micronutrients. Dairy users had a lower prevalence of micronutrient inadequacies than non-dairy users. The prevalence of vitamin D inadequacies indairy users versus non-dairy users was 91.6% vs. 99.3% in men and 71.9% vs. 98.0%in women, respectively. Inadequate vitamin B12 intake was found in 60.6% of dairyusers vs. 89.4% of non-dairy users in men and 65.5% vs.. 68.4% of women,respectively. The most pronounced difference was found in the prevalence ofcalcium intake inadequacies in dairy users vs. non-dairy users, which was 64.8%vs. 99.5% in men and 89.9% vs. 99.8% in women. We found statistically significantdifferences in the prevalence of calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B inadequaciesbetween dairy and non-dairy users. CONCLUSION: This study identified that dairyusers had a higher monthly income and had a lower proportion of hypertension,diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia. In addition, we discovered a high prevalenceof nutrient intakes inadequacies in Indonesian older adults, particularly amongnon-dairy users. Micronutrient inadequacies are major sources of concern, withstatistically significant difference in calcium, vitamin D, and vitamin B12prevalence of inadequacies.

AB  - Micronutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and other bioactive compounds, havetremendous impacts on human health. Much progress has been made in improving the micronutrient content of inbred lines in various crops through biofortifiedbreeding. However, biofortified breeding still falls short for the rapidgeneration of high-yielding hybrids rich in multiple micronutrients. Here, webred multi-biofortified sweet corn hybrids efficiently through marker-assistedselection. Screening by molecular markers for vitamin E and folic acid, weobtained 15 inbred lines carrying favorable alleles (six for vitamin E, nine for folic acid, and three for both). Multiple biofortified corn hybrids weredeveloped through crossing and genetic diversity analysis.

PG  - 16-26
LID - 10.14715/cmb/2021.67.5.3 [doi]
AB  - The research aims to identify the inhibitory potential of natural dietaryphytochemicals against non-insulinotropic target protein alpha-glucosidase andits possible implications to diabetes mellitus type 2. A data set of sixteenplant-derived dietary molecules viz., 4,5-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone,apigenin, bromelain, caffeic acid, cholecalciferol, dihydrokaempferol7-o-glucopyranoside, galactomannan, genkwanin, isoimperatorin, luteolin, luteolin7-o-glucoside, neohesperidin, oleanoic acid, pelargonidin-3-rutinoside,quercetin, and quinic acid were taken to accomplish molecular docking succeededby their comparison with known inhibitors including acarbose, miglitol,voglibose, emiglitate, and 1-deoxynojirimycin. Among all phyto-compounds,bromelain (DeltaG: -9.54 kcal/mol), cholecalciferol (-8.47 kcal/mol), luteolin(-9.02 kcal/mol), and neohesperidin (-8.53 kcal/mol) demonstrated better binding interactions with alpha-glucosidase in comparison to the best-known inhibitor,acarbose (DeltaG: -7.93 kcal/mol). Molecular dynamics simulation of 10 nsduration, CYP450 site of metabolism identification, and prediction of activityspectra for substances depicted the bromelain as the most stable inhibitorcompared to luteolin and acarbose. Findings of molecular interactions, molecular dynamics study, metabolism, and biological activity prediction proved bromelainas a potential alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. Thus, bromelain might be helpful asan insulin-independent therapeutic molecule towards controlling and managingdiabetes mellitus type 2.

AB  - Inflammatory markers play an important role in the pathophysiology of patientswith oral problems such as oral lichen planus. This study aimed to investigatethe relationship between vitamin D levels and inflammatory markers and totalantioxidants in people with oral lichen planus. In this case-control study, 131patients with oral lichen planus (67 in the lichen planus group and 54 in thecontrol group) were examined. 8 cc of blood was taken from all participants toassess blood factors, inflammatory markers and antioxidant levels. Data wereanalyzed using SPSS statistical software. The mean age of subjects was 42 years. Vitamin D3 levels in the lichen planus group were lower than in the controlgroup, but this decrease was not statistically significant (P> 0.05). Accordingto statistical findings in the lichen planus group, there was a significantrelationship between vitamin D3 levels, inflammatory markers and cellular stress factors (P</=0.05). It is concluded that vitamin D3 in people with oral lichenplanus can play an important role in the pathogenesis of oral disease andincrease inflammation. Because patients with oral lichen planus are affected byvarious inflammatory factors, paying attention to vitamin D levels in thesepatients can be effective in reducing inflammation caused by lichen planus.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of the mFOLFOX6 regimen combined with SHR-1210 on immune function and prognosis in patients with microsatelliteinstability CRC. For this purpose, 60 patients with microsatellite instabilityCRC in our hospital from January 2019 to October 2020 were randomly divided into control and observation groups. The control group was treated with the mFOLFOX6regimen, and the observation group was treated with s SHR-1210. After continuous treatment for 3 months, the clinical effects of the two groups were compared;CD4+, CD8+, CD4+/CD8+; IgA, IgG, IgM; Incidence of adverse reactions and PFS. Theresults showed that compared with the control group (30.00%), the total clinical effective rate in the observation group (53.33%) was significantly higher (P <0.05). After treatment, CD4+, CD4+/ CD8+ decreased significantly and CD8+increased significantly, and the change range of the observation group wassignificantly less than the control group (P < 0.05. The levels of IgA, IgG andIgM in the two groups decreased significantly after treatment, and the decreasein the observation group was significantly less than the control group (P <0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of abnormal liverfunction, bleeding, proteinuria, neurotoxicity, gastrointestinal reaction,leucopenia and hypertension between the two groups (P > 0.05). PFS in theobservation group was significantly prolonged after treatment (P < 0.05). Ingeneral, the mFOLFOX6 regimen combined with SHR-1210 is effective in thetreatment of microsatellite instability CRC. It can not only improve the immunefunction, but also not increase adverse reactions, prolong the survival time, andhas a high clinical reference value.

AB  - Both subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) and sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) areeffective clinically against allergic rhinitis and allergic asthma, and modifythe underlying immunologic abnormalities. Despite this, many patients who couldbenefit from receiving SCIT and SLIT do not because of concerns about safety and the inconvenience in receiving SCIT, and the long duration of treatment withboth, 3-4 years being required for lasting benefit. Attempts to improve theefficacy and safety, and to shorten the course of allergen immunotherapy havetaken many approaches. Some approaches have generated great enthusiasm, only tofail in larger trials and be discarded. Other approaches show some promise butperhaps not enough to achieve regulatory approval. Those approaches that seem to have the best chance of becoming available in the next few years include thefollowing: intralymphatic and epicutaneous immunotherapy, vitamin D in patientswith insufficient serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D, probiotics, and allergoids, but allrequire further studies before being ready for nonexperimental use or, wherenecessary, for regulatory approval.

TI  - Evidence based recommendations for an optimal prenatal supplement for women inthe US: vitamins and related nutrients.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1186/s40748-022-00139-9 [doi]
AB  - The blood levels of most vitamins decrease during pregnancy if un-supplemented,including vitamins A, C, D, K, B1, B3, B5, B6, folate, biotin, and B12.Sub-optimal intake of vitamins from preconception through pregnancy increases therisk of many pregnancy complications and infant health problems. In the U.S.,dietary intake of vitamins is often below recommended intakes, especially forvitamin D, choline and DHA. Many studies suggest that insufficient vitamin intakeis associated with a wide range of pregnancy complications (anemia, Cesareansection, depression, gestational diabetes, hypertension, infertility,preeclampsia, and premature rupture of membranes) and infant health problems(asthma/wheeze, autism, low birth weight, congenital heart defects, intellectual development, intrauterine growth restriction, miscarriage, neural tube defects,orofacial defects, and preterm birth). The primary goal of this paper is toreview the research literature and propose evidence-based recommendations for theoptimal level of prenatal supplementation for each vitamin for most women in the United States. A secondary goal was to compare these new recommendations with thelevels of vitamins in over 180 commercial prenatal supplements. The analysisfound that prenatal supplements vary widely in content, often contained only asubset of essential vitamins, and the levels were often below ourrecommendations. This suggests that increasing prenatal vitamin supplementationto the levels recommended here may reduce the incidence of many pregnancycomplications and infant health problems which currently occur.

AB  - One of the biggest challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic is the heterogeneity indisease severity exhibited amongst patients. Among multiple factors, lateststudies suggest vitamin D deficiency and pre-existing health conditions to bemajor contributors to death from COVID-19. It is known that certain urban formattributes can impact sun exposure and vitamin D synthesis. Also, long-termexposure to air pollution can play an independent role in vitamin D deficiency.We conducted a correlational analysis of urban form and air quality in relationto the demographics and COVID-19 incidence and mortality across 32 Londonboroughs between March 2020 and January 2021. We found total population, numberof residents of Asian ethnicity, 4-year average PM10 levels and road length to bepositively correlated with COVID-19 cases and deaths. We also found percentage ofhouseholds with access to total open space to be negatively correlated withCOVID-19 deaths. Our findings link COVID-19 incidence and mortality across Londonwith environmental variables linked to vitamin D status. Our study is entirelybased on publicly available data and provides a reference framework for furtherresearch as more data are gathered and the syndemic dimension of COVID-19 becomesincreasingly relevant in connection to health inequalities within large urbanareas.

AB  - Compared with the traditional single therapy, nanomedicine has promoted amultimodal combination treatment for various carcinomas, especially thedevelopment of corresponding intelligent multifunctional biomaterials based onadvanced DNA nanotechnology has great potential in cancer combination therapy.Herein, we describe a strategy to "backpack" aptamer PL1, which specificallybinds to PD-L1 and Pcsk9 siRNA on well-defined DNA tetrahedral nanoparticles(TDNs) via DNA hybridization, which collectively contributes to the effectivetherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC). In addition, we designed a targeted TDN uponfolic acid (FA) recognition, limiting its release to the sites of tumors wherefolic acid receptor (FAR) is encountered. Our results demonstrated that theTDN-FA/PL1/Pcsk9-siRNA could free immune cells to target CRC cells and attenuate 83.48% tumor growth in mouse models of CT26 CRC. Mechanically, thecancer-targeting FA guided TDN-FA/PL1/Pcsk9-siRNA into tumor cells, therebyensuring that the aptamer PL1 could choke the mutual effects between PD-1 andPD-L1, followed by a 1.69-fold increase in T cell number and a 1.9-foldsuppression of T cell activity by the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, while Pcsk9 siRNAdecreased Pcsk9 expression averagely to the extent of 65.13% and then facilitatedintratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T cells robustly with IFN-gamma andGranzyme B expression. Our results reveal that the multifunctionalTND-FA/PL1/Pcsk9-siRNA is effective and safe for CRC therapy, thereby expandingthe application of DNA nanotechnology for innovative therapies of variouscancers.

AB  - The rational design of chemical coatings is used to control surface interactions with small molecules, biomolecules, nanoparticles, and liquids as well as opticaland other properties. Specifically, micropatterned surface coatings have beenused in a wide variety of applications, including biosensing, cell growth assays,multiplexed biomolecule interaction arrays, and responsive surfaces. Here, amaskless photopatterning process is studied, using the photocatalyzed thiol-yne"click" reaction to create both binary and gradient patterns on thiolatedsurfaces. Nearly defect-free patterns are produced by first coating glasssurfaces with mercaptopropylsilatrane, a silanizing agent that forms smootherself-assembled monolayers than the commonly used3-mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane. Photopatterning is then performed using UV (365nm) or visible (405 nm) light to graft molecules onto the surface in tunableconcentrations based on the local exposure. The technique is demonstrated formultiple types of molecular grafts, including fluorescent dyes, poly(ethyleneglycol), and biotin, the latter allowing subsequent deposition of biomoleculesvia biotin-avidin binding. Patterning is demonstrated in water anddimethylformamide, and the process is repeated to combine molecules soluble indifferent phases. The combination of arbitrary gradient formation, broadapplicability, a low defect rate, and fast prototyping thanks to the masklessnature of the process creates a particularly powerful technique for molecularsurface patterning that could be used for a wide variety of micropatternedapplications.

TI  - Three enigmatic BioH isoenzymes are programmed in the early stage ofmycobacterial biotin synthesis, an attractive anti-TB drug target.
PG  - e1010615

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the leading infectious diseases of global concern,and one quarter of the world's population are TB carriers. Biotin metabolismappears to be an attractive anti-TB drug target. However, the first-stage ofmycobacterial biotin synthesis is fragmentarily understood. Here we report thatthree evolutionarily-distinct BioH isoenzymes (BioH1 to BioH3) are programmed in biotin synthesis of Mycobacterium smegmatis. Expression of an individual bioHisoform is sufficient to allow the growth of an Escherichia coli DeltabioH mutanton the non-permissive condition lacking biotin. The enzymatic activity in vitrocombined with biotin bioassay in vivo reveals that BioH2 and BioH3 are capable ofremoving methyl moiety from pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester to give pimeloyl-ACP, acognate precursor for biotin synthesis. In particular, we determine the crystalstructure of dimeric BioH3 at 2.27A, featuring a unique lid domain. Apart fromits catalytic triad, we also dissect the substrate recognition of BioH3 bypimeloyl-ACP methyl ester. The removal of triple bioH isoforms (DeltabioH1/2/3)renders M. smegmatis biotin auxotrophic. Along with the newly-identifiedTam/BioC, the discovery of three unusual BioH isoforms defines an atypical'BioC-BioH(3)' paradigm for the first-stage of mycobacterial biotin synthesis.This study solves a long-standing puzzle in mycobacterial nutritional immunity,providing an alternative anti-TB drug target.

TI  - Actinomadura parmotrematis sp. nov., isolated from the foliose lichen, Parmotremapraesorediosum (Nyl.) Hale.
LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.005447 [doi]
AB  - A novel actinomycete strain PM05-2(T) was isolated from the lichen Parmotremapraesorediosum (Nyl.) Hale collected from Chaiyaphum Province, Thailand. Thetaxonomic position of the strain was studied using the polyphasic approach. Basedon the morphology and chemotaxonomic properties, strain PM05-2(T) was identified as a member of the genus Actinomadura. The whole-cell hydrolysate containedmeso-diaminopimelic acid, rhamnose, ribose, xylose, madurose, glucose andgalactose. The polar lipids were phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol,phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, one unidentifiedphosphoglycolipid, four unidentified phospholipids and one unidentified lipid.The menaquinones were MK-9(H6), MK-9(H4), MK-9(H2), MK-9(H8) and MK-9(H0). Themajor cellular fatty acids were C16:0 and C18:1 omega9c. Strain PM05-2(T) showed the highest 16S rRNA gene similarity to Actinomadura hibisca NBRC 15177(T)(98.58%), Actinomadura kijaniata NBRC 14229(T) (98.29 %) and Actinomaduranamibiensis DSM 44197(T) (98.14 %). The phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that strain PM05-2(T) was related to A. hibisca NBRC 15177(T), A. kijaniata NBRC14229(T), A. namibiensis DSM 44197(T) and Actinomadura macrotermitis RB68(T). Thegenomic analysis revealed that average nucleotide identity values based on bothblast and MUMmer between strain PM05-2(T) and the relative type strains rangedfrom 77.6 to 86.4%. The digital DNA-DNA hybridization values among the strainswere lower than the threshold for assigning to the same species. The taxonomicresults suggested that strain PM05-2(T) represented a novel species of the genus Actinomadura for which the name Actinomadura parmotrematis is proposed. The type strain is PM05-2(T) (=TBRC 15492(T)=NBRC 115416(T)).

TI  - Humibacter ginsenosidimutans sp. nov., with ginsenoside-converting activityisolated from activated sludge.
LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.005442 [doi]
AB  - A novel Gram-stain-positive, thin rod-shaped, non-motile, aerobic andcreamy-white pigmented bacterium (designated strain WJ7-1(T)) was isolated fromactivated sludge sampled in Suwon, Republic of Korea. 16S rRNA gene sequenceanalysis indicated that the isolate belongs to the genus Humibacter, familyMicrobacteriaceae, with a sequence similarity of 97.9 % to its nearest neighbour Humibacter albus KACC 20986(T). Strain WJ7-1(T) contained menaquinone (MK)-10(16.0 %), 11 (48.5 %) and 12 (35.5 %) as major respiratory quinones. Thepredominant cellular fatty acids (>15 %) were anteiso-C17 : 0, iso-C16 : 0 andanteiso-C15 : 0. The peptidoglycan of strain WJ7-1(T) contained the diagnosticdiamino acid ornithine and 2,4-diaminobutyric acid alanine. Alanine, glutamicacid and glycine were also present in the cell wall. The characteristicwhole-cell sugars present were glucose, galactose, xylose and rhamnose. The polarlipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, an unidentifiedglycolipid and two unidentified phospholipids. Strain WJ7-1(T) possessedginsenoside-converting (beta-glucosidase) activity, which enabled it to transformginsenoside protopanaxadiol-type Rb1 (one of the dominant active components ofginseng) to compound K. The genome size of strain WJ7-1(T) has 4.2 Mbp and theG+C content is 68.3 mol%. Average nucleotide identity, amino acid identity anddigital DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain WJ7-1(T) and the closelyrelated strain were 79.8, 36.1 and 23.5 %, respectively, indicating that strainWJ7-1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Humibacter. Strain WJ7-1(T)could be distinguished from the other members of the genus Humibacter by a numberof chemotaxonomic and phenotypic characteristics. Based on polyphasic taxonomicanalysis, strain WJ7-1(T) (=KACC 19729(T)=LMG 30802(T)) represents a novelspecies within the genus Humibacter, for which the name Humibacterginsenosidimutans sp. nov. is proposed.

TI  - Short duration treadmill exercise improves physical function and skeletal muscle mitochondria protein expression after recovery from FOLFOX chemotherapy in malemice.
PG  - e22437
LID - 10.1096/fj.202200460R [doi]
AB  - FOLFOX (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) is a chemotherapy treatment for colorectalcancer which induces toxic side effects involving fatigue, weakness, and skeletalmuscle dysfunction. There is a limited understanding of the recovery from thesetoxicities after treatment cessation. Exercise training can improvechemotherapy-related toxicities. However, how exercise accelerates recovery andthe dose required for these benefits are not well examined. The purpose of thisstudy was to examine the effect of exercise duration on physical function, musclemass, and mitochondria protein expression during the recovery from FOLFOXchemotherapy. 12-week-old male mice were administered four cycles of either PBSor FOLFOX over 8-weeks. Outcomes were assessed after the fourth cycle and aftereither 4 (short-term; STR) or 10 weeks (long-term; LTR) recovery. Subsets of miceperformed 14 sessions (6 d/wk, 18 m/min, 5% grade) of 60 min/d (long) or 15 min/d(short duration) treadmill exercise during STR. Red and white gastrocnemius mRNA and protein expression were examined. FOLFOX treatment decreased run time (RT)(-53%) and grip strength (GS) (-9%) compared to PBS. FOLFOX also reduced muscleOXPHOS complexes, COXIV, and VDAC protein expression. At LTR, FOLFOX RT (-36%)and GS (-16%) remained reduced. Long- and short-duration treadmill exerciseimproved RT (+58% and +56%) without restoring GS in FOLFOX mice. Both exercisedurations increased muscle VDAC and COXIV expression in FOLFOX mice. These dataprovide evidence that FOLFOX chemotherapy induces persistent deficits in physicalfunction that can be partially reversed by short-duration aerobic exercise.

AB  - From the ancient period, Green leafy vegetables (GLV) are part of the daily diet and were believed to have several health beneficial properties. Later it has beenproved that GLV has outstanding nutritional value and can be used for medicinalbenefits. GLV is particularly rich in minerals like iron, calcium, and zinc.These are also rich in vitamins like beta carotene, vitamin E, K, B and vitaminC. In addition, some anti-nutritional elements in GLV can be reduced if it isgrown properly and processed properly before consumption. Tropical countries havea wide variety of these green plants such as Red Spinach, Amaranth, MalabarSpinach, Taro Leaf, Fenugreek leaf, Bengal Gram Leaves, Radish Leaves, MustardLeaves, and many more. This review focuses on listing this wide range of GLVs (intotal 54 underutilized GLVs) and their compositions in a comparative manner. GLV also possesses medicinal activities due to its rich bioactive and nutritionalpotential. Different processing techniques may alter the nutritional andbioactive potential of the GLVs significantly. The GLVs have been considered afood fortification agent, though not explored widely. All of these findingssuggest that increasing GLV consumption could provide nutritional requirementsnecessary for proper growth as well as adequate protection against diseasescaused by malnutrition.

AB  - Over the last 30 years, thousands of articles have appeared examining the effectsof soaking and germinating brown rice (BR). Variable germination conditions andmethods have been employed to measure different health-beneficial parameters in adiverse germplasm of BR. Research results may therefore appear inconsistent with occasional anomalies, and it may be difficult to reach consensus concerningexpected trends. Herein, we amassed a comprehensive review on germinated brownrice (GBR), attempting to codify 133 peer-reviewed articles regarding the effectson 164 chemical parameters related to health and nutrition in BR and invalue-added food products. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviewsand Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-2020) approach was used to direct the flow of theliterature search. A pair-wise comparison t-test was performed to deliver anoverall approach indicating when a given compound has been found to significantlyincrease or decrease through germination, which was grouped into GABA andpolyamines, gamma-Oryzanol and phytosterols, phenolic compounds, vitamins,proteins and amino acids, starchy carbohydrates, free sugars, lipids, mineralsand phytic acid. This resource will stimulate interest in germinating rice andoptimistically help increase both production and consumption of highlynutritious, health-beneficial rice with pigmented bran.

AB  - For decades, retinoids have been considered the gold standard of treatment for a variety of skin conditions.1,2 As the bioavailable form of vitamin A, retinoicacid has demonstrated the ability to reduce skin discoloration, stimulatecollagen production, reduce rhytids, improve acne, and uneven skin texture.3,4Retinoic acid is a potent drug with high bioavailability. Challenges with such a product include skin sensitivity and retinoid dermatitis.1,5 This potentialirritation and discomfort may hinder patient compliance reducing visible results.The non-prescription vitamin A ingredient retinol is an effective and lessirritating alternative, as it is converted into retinoic acid within the skin,causing little to no irritation when used topically. Intensive Age RefiningTreatment: 0.5% pure retinol night by PCA SKIN&reg; contains 0.5% retinol,protected and delivered into the skin with a multi-layered liposomal deliverytechnology. This development addresses the inherent instability of retinol,1,2,3 as well as the mitigation of irritation with the goal of enhancing patientcompliance and visible results. This formulation also features niacinamide andterminalia chebula to further support the anti-aging benefits of retinol. The12-week in vivo use of this potent, yet non-irritating retinol topicaldemonstrates improved patient compliance and satisfaction due to tolerability andenhanced efficacy in the improvement in overall signs of healthy skin.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Tazarotene Lotion, 0.045% in the Treatment of Truncal AcneVulgaris.
PG  - 713-716
LID - 10.36849/JDD.6967 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although truncal acne is thought to have the same pathophysiology as facial acne, treatment response may differ based on body area involvement.Traditionally, prescribers have relied on oral therapies for the management oftruncal acne, possibly because oral therapy has been considered more convenientthan topical application of medication to the chest and back. A lotionformulation may be particularly well-suited for the treatment of truncal acne.Tazarotene lotion, 0.045% is FDA approved for treatment of acne vulgaris inindividuals 9 years of age or older. This pilot study was designed to investigatethe efficacy and safety of Arazlo lotion for the treatment of truncal acne. STUDYFINDINGS: A total of 19 subjects ranging in age from 12 to 58 years completed the12-week study. There were significant reductions in truncal IGA (the primaryendpoint) at each of the study follow-up visits. At week 12, 89% of subjects wereclear or almost clear, as assessed by truncal IGA score. There were statisticallysignificant reductions in inflammatory, non-inflammatory, and total lesion countsfrom baseline to week 12. Treatment with tazarotene lotion 0.045% waswell-tolerated, with erythema, dryness, peeling, oiliness, pruritis, and burning generally rated as trace or mild. Most subjects (64% or more) rated the lotion as&ldquo;Good&rdquo; or &ldquo;Excellent&rdquo; in general and in comparison totheir prior medications. CONCLUSIONS: Tazarotene lotion, 0.045% is shown to beeffective and well-tolerated for the management of truncal acne in this pilotstudy. Further studies with placebo control and larger populations are warranted.J Drugs Dermatol. 2022;21(7):713-716. doi:10.36849/JDD.6967.

AB  - Retinoids are a mainstay of dermatologic therapy. Although prescription retinoidsare more potent than over the counter retinoids, when properly formulatedcosmetic retinoids offer consumers an easily accessible, reasonably pricedtherapeutic option. Retinol has been shown to improve fine lines and wrinkles,hyperpigmentation, skin roughness, and the appearance of photoaged skin. Theefficacy and tolerability of retinol makes it preferable to prescriptionretinoids as many patients are intolerant of these more potent forms. In thisreview, we will discuss the pharmacokinetics of retinol and the clinical studies confirming its efficacy, tolerability, and safety with long-term use. J DrugsDermatol. 2022;21:7(Suppl):s4-10.

TI  - Dietary factors that affect the risk of pre-eclampsia.
PG  - 118-133
LID - 10.1136/bmjnph-2021-000399 [doi]
AB  - Pre-eclampsia affects 3%-5% of pregnant women worldwide and is associated with a range of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, including maternal and/or fetaldeath. It particularly affects those with chronic hypertension, pregestationaldiabetes mellitus or a family history of pre-eclampsia. Other than early deliveryof the fetus, there is no cure for pre-eclampsia. Since diet or dietarysupplements may affect the risk, we have carried out an up-to-date, narrativeliterature review to assess the relationship between nutrition and pre-eclampsia.Several nutrients and dietary factors previously believed to be implicated in therisk of pre-eclampsia have now been shown to have no effect on risk; theseinclude vitamins C and E, magnesium, salt, omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturatedfatty acids (fish oils) and zinc. Body mass index is proportionally correlatedwith pre-eclampsia risk, therefore women should aim for a healthy pre-pregnancybody weight and avoid excessive gestational and interpregnancy weight gain. Theassociation between the risk and progression of the pathophysiology ofpre-eclampsia may explain the apparent benefit of dietary modifications resultingfrom increased consumption of fruits and vegetables (>/=400 g/day), plant-basedfoods and vegetable oils and a limited intake of foods high in fat, sugar andsalt. Consuming a high-fibre diet (25-30 g/day) may attenuate dyslipidaemia andreduce blood pressure and inflammation. Other key nutrients that may mitigate therisk include increased calcium intake, a daily multivitamin/mineral supplementand an adequate vitamin D status. For those with a low selenium intake (such asthose living in Europe), fish/seafood intake could be increased to improveselenium intake or selenium could be supplemented in the recommendedmultivitamin/mineral supplement. Milk-based probiotics have also been found to bebeneficial in pregnant women at risk. Our recommendations are summarised in atable of guidance for women at particular risk of developing pre-eclampsia.

Methods: The present study observed two groups of patients fromUrumqi, Xinjiang, China, from April 2017 to March 2018. There were two subjectgroups: the hypertension group (80 patients with essential hypertension selected by random cluster sampling) and the control group (76 healthy adults). The25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D or vitamin D) levels were measured throughelectrolytes; fasting blood glucose, blood lipids, and other biochemicalindicators were detected using immune chemiluminescence; and plasma reninactivity and angiotensin II concentrations were detected with radio-immunity.Results: Comparison between the hypertension group and control group showedstatistically significant differences in the systolic pressure and levels of25(OH)D, renin, and triglycerides (P < 0.05). The correlation analysis showedthat 25(OH)D was negatively correlated with renin (r = -0.185; P=0.021) andpositively correlated with systolic pressure (r = -0.105; P=0.035). There were nostatistically significant differences in diastolic pressure, fasting bloodglucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-densitylipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides between the two groups. Conclusions:The results of the present study show that vitamin D deficiency is common inUrumqi, Xinjiang, China and vitamin D levels are negatively correlated with reninlevels. Vitamin D plays an important role in regulating blood pressure byaffecting renin levels through the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

AB  - Background: The Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT), an updated and newly developedmetric to assess combat readiness, may require specialized exercise andnutritional interventions. The purpose of this cross-sectional study was toinvestigate the relationship between body composition, erythrocyte long-chainomega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA), serum vitamin D (VITD) andACFT performance. Methods: Sixty cadets (43 males, 17 females; 20.9 +/- 3.8years; 173.6 +/- 10.2 cm; 75.6 +/- 13.7 kg) completed the 6-event ACFT(3-repetition maximum trap-bar deadlift [3DL], standing power toss [SPT],hand-release pushups [HRPU], sprint-drag-carry shuttle run [SDC], leg tuck [LTK],or plank [PLK], and 2-mile run [2MR]), body composition analysis via dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (percent body fat [%BF], lean body mass [LBM], fat-free massindex [FFMI (LBM+bone mineral content)]), and an omega-3 questionnaire. Asub-sample (n = 50) completed blood draws for fatty acid (eicosapentaenoic acid[EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) and VITD analysis. Significance was set at p < .05. Results: Lower %BF predicted better performance on all ACFT events (p < .05), except the PLK. Higher LBM was predictive of better performance on the 3DL,SPT, and SDC (p < .05), but no other events. Adjusted FFMI was positivelycorrelated with the 3DL, SPT, HRPU, SDC, and ACFT scores (p < .01 for all). CadetEPA and DHA dietary intake and omega-3 erythrocyte status was well belowestablished recommendations (25.6 +/- 33.9 mg, 58.3 +/- 78.1 mg, respectively)and an omega-3 index (O3i = %EPA+%DHA in erythrocytes) of 3.96 +/- 1.36%,respectively. EPA was associated with better performance on the 3DL (r = 0.280, p= .049), SPT (r = 0.314, p = .027), LTK (r = 0.316, p = .047), and PLK (r =0.837, p = .003). After adjusting for body composition, erythrocyte EPA onlyremained predictive of PLK scores (p = .006). Every 0.1% increase in EPAtranslated into 5.4 (95% CI: 2.1, 8.8) better PLK score. The O3i or DHA were not associated with any performance variables. Cadets' average serum VITD status was 38.0 +/- 14.9 ngml(-1). VITD was associated with 3DL (r = 0.305, p = .031), HRPU (r = 0.355, p = .011), 2MR (r = 0.326, p = .021), and total ACFT score (r =0.359, p = .011). VITD remained predictive of each event after adjustment forbody composition. Every 10 ngml(-1) increase in VITD was associated with 3-point increase in 3DL, HRPU, 2MR scores, and a 13-point increase in the total ACFTscore. Conclusions: Our data highlight the importance of measures of muscularity,LBM and FFMI, on ACFT performance. Additionally, EPA and VITD status isassociated with various strength, power, and muscular and aerobic endurancecomponents of the ACFT. While these results could help professionals betterassess and train military personnel, especially since these measures aremodifiable through exercise and dietary interventions, they are ultimatelyhypothesis generating and warrant further exploration.

AB  - Background: Excessive production of free radicals caused by many types ofexercise results in oxidative stress, which leads to muscle damage, fatigue, and impaired performance. Supplementation with royal jelly (RJ) or coenzyme Q10(CoQ10) has been shown to attenuate exercise-induced oxidant stress in damagedmuscle and improve various aspects of exercise performance in many but not allstudies. Nevertheless, the effects of treatments based on RJ plus CoQ10supplementation, which may be potentially beneficial for reducing oxidativestress and enhancing athletic performance, remain unexplored. This study aimed toexamine whether oral RJ and CoQ10 co-supplementation could improve high-intensityinterval exercise (HIIE) performance in swimmers, inhibiting exercise-inducedoxidative stress and muscle damage. Methods: Twenty high-level swimmers wererandomly allocated to receive either 400 mg of RJ and 60 mg of CoQ10 (RJQ) ormatching placebo (PLA) once daily for 10 days. Exercise performance was evaluatedat baseline, and then reassessed at day 10 of intervention, using a HIIEprotocol. Diene conjugates (DC), Schiff bases (SB), and creatine kinase (CK) werealso measured in blood plasma and saliva before and immediately after HIIE inboth groups. Results: HIIE performance expressed as number of points according toa single assessment system developed and approved by the International SwimmingFederation (FINA points) significantly improved in RJQ group (p = 0.013) comparedto PLA group. Exercise-induced increase in DC, SB, and CK levels in plasma andsaliva significantly diminished only in RJQ group (p < 0.05). Regression analysisshowed that oral RJQ administration for 10 days was significantly associated withreductions in HIIE-induced increases in plasmatic and salivary DC, SB, and CKlevels compared to PLA. Principal component analysis revealed that swimmerstreated with RJQ are grouped by both plasmatic and salivary principal components (PC) into a separate cluster compared to PLA. Strong negative correlation betweenthe number of FINA points and plasmatic and salivary PC1 values was observed inboth intervention groups. Conclusion: The improvements in swimmers' HIIEperformance were due in significant part to RJQ-induced reducing in lipidperoxidation and muscle damage in response to exercise. These findings suggestthat RJQ supplementation for 10 days is potentially effective for enhancing HIIE performance and alleviating oxidant stress.

PG  - 913155
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.913155 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Previous observational studies have suggested associations betweenconcentrations of several circulating micronutrients and sarcopenia. However, thecausality inferred from those studies was subjected to residual confounding andreverse causation. Therefore, we aimed to examine the causal effects of thelevels of genetically predicted serum micronutrients on sarcopenia. Methods:Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were chosen from large-scale genome-wideassociation studies of participants only with European descent and were used asgenetic instruments for the levels of 10 serum micronutrients (calcium,magnesium, selenium, copper, iron, zinc, Vitamin A, Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, andVitamin E). Sarcopenia was defined by referencing to the 2019 definition given bythe European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People (EWGSOP). A two-sampleMendelian randomization (MR) analysis was carried out to examine the associationsbetween the levels of genetically predicted serum micronutrients and the risk of sarcopenia. Then, sensitivity analyses (including weighted median, MR-Egger andleave-one-out sensitivity analyses) were performed to evaluate the robustness of study findings. The estimates were presented as odds ratio (OR) with their 95%confidence intervals (CIs) per one standard deviation (SD) increase in theexposures. Results: A total of 378,635 UK Biobank participants, including 572participants who were identified with sarcopenia, were included in this study.The iron status was shown to have a clear effect on the risk of sarcopenia based on MR analyses. The per one SD increment in the genetically-determined serum ironlevel corresponded to a 53% increase in the risk of sarcopenia (OR = 1.53, 95%CI: 1.31-1.78, P = 0.001). The exclusion of SNPs of the circulating iron level(i.e., rs1799945 SNP, rs1800562 SNP or rs855791 SNP) did not attenuate themagnitude of the signal in MR analysis. There was little evidence supporting the associations between other remaining micronutrients and sarcopenia. Conclusions: An increased risk of sarcopenia was observed with a genetically higherconcentration of iron, suggesting that iron may play a role in the occurrence or development of sarcopenia.

AB  - Aim: It's unclear whether diet quality affects glycemic management. The index of nutritional quality (INQ) can examine diets both quantitatively and qualitatively(INQ). Hence, this study aimed to determine whether INQ and fasting blood sugar(FBS) are related among Iranian women. Methods: This cross-sectional study wasconducted on 360 adult Iranian women. Data were collected on the participants'general characteristics, medical history, anthropometric indices, physicalactivity, and dietary intake. For nutrient intake assessment, a valid foodfrequency questionnaire (FFQ) was used, and INQ was then calculated using thedaily nutrient intake. Results: After adjusting for age, FBS was significantlyinverse associated with INQ for vitamins A (B = -0.193, p < 0.01), magnesium (B =-0.137, p < 0.01), phosphor (B = -0.175, p < 0.01), zinc (B = -0.113, p < 0.01), vitamin K (B = -0.197, p < 0.01), manganese (B = -0.111, p < 0.01) and selenium(B = -0.123, p < 0.01). The association between FBS and INQ for Se and Mn wasdisappeared after further adjustment for gender, body mass index (BMI),menopausal status, and total energy intake. Conclusion: There was a significantinverse relationship between FBS and the INQ of vitamin A, manganese, phosphor,zinc, vitamin K, magnesium, and selenium. Prospective cohort studies should beconducted to establish a causal relationship between FBS and INQ.

AB  - Euglena gracilis, a single-celled microalga with various trophic growth stylesunder different cultivation conditions, contains nutrients, such asss-1,3-glucans, essential amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. Ithas recently attracted attention as a new health food. Among them,ss-1,3-glucans, paramylon of Euglena, is an insoluble dietary fiber and is wellknown as an immune booster, attenuator of obesity and diabetes, reducer of acute liver injury, and suppressor of atopic dermatitis, and other chronic inflammatorydisorders. Recently, evidence has appeared for the positive health effects offoods, food ingredients, or biochemical compounds derived from several othermicroalgae, such as Chlorella, Spirulina, Dunaliella, Phaeodactylum, and Pavlova.Until most recently, the prebiotic activity of Euglena and paramylon wasreported. Emerging prospects of microalgae as prebiotics were well summarized,but the mechanisms behind the bacterial growth promotion by microalgae are notelucidated yet. Thus, we evaluated the prebiotic prospects of both autotrophicand heterotrophic Euglena on six different Lactobacillus. What's more, thestimulated mechanism was revealed by bacterial culture medium metabolomicanalysis. This study could widen the knowledge about the prebiotic activity ofEuglena as a next-generation prebiotic and other microalgae-derived compounds as potential health foods.

AB  - Based on the observed production of H2O2 in formulated beverages containingartificial or 'non-natural' mixtures of anti-oxidants (AOXs), it was hypothesizedthat the natural redox-active compounds present in orange juice (OJ) might alsoproduce H2O2. Here, we report the levels of H2O2 found in commerciallymanufactured OJ products in 'fresh' (4 degrees C on-shelf storage, N = 9) and'processed' (ambient on-shelf storage, N = 9) categories. The averageconcentrations of H2O2 immediately after opening the container (T0) weresignificantly higher (p < 0.01) in processed (11.15 +/- 2.83 microM) versus fresh(3.74 +/- 2.02 microM) sample sets. Levels of H2O2 at T0 were uncorrelated withstorage time post-manufacture and increased after opening (1 to 4-fold), followedby significant decrease after 24 hr (p < 0.05). Using Pearson's correlationanalysis; ascorbic acid, total reducible substances and total sugar were eachsignificantly positively correlated, while total protein, fibre and unsaturatedfats were each significantly negatively correlated, with H2O2 levels in OJs.

TI  - Oral ecological environment modifications by hard-cheese: from pH to microbiome: a prospective cohort study based on 16S rRNA metabarcoding approach.
PG  - 312

AB  - BACKGROUND: The oral ecosystem conditions dental health, and is known to bepositively modified by oral hygiene which cannot always be performed betweenmeals, especially outside home. It is therefore important to identify thepractices to be adopted to influence the oral environment in an anticariogenicdirection. Milk and cheese are considered functional foods and have a role onoral health. There are several mechanisms by which cheese exerts its beneficialeffects on teeth. The aim of the present study was to examine whether short term consumption of hard cheese would affect the oral pH and microbial flora ofhealthy adults modifying ecological oral environment. The Next GenerationSequencing (NGS) approach was applied to study the effect of Italian Grana Padano(GP), as a prototype of typical hard cheese, on the oral microbiota composition. Finally, we explored Streptococcus mutans/sanguinis ratio as a marker ofprotective biofilm composition. METHODS: Nine oral-healthy adults were instructedto eat 25 gr of GP cheese for 5 consecutive days. Three time points were chosenfor supragingival samples collection and pH measurement. 16S rRNA-gene sequences were obtained both from oral samples and GP cheese using the MiSeq platform andanalyzed against the expanded Human Oral Microbiome Database (eHOMD). ProgPermwas used to perform statistical analyses to investigate strain differentialrepresentation after cheese consumption. RESULTS: Taxonomic analyses of the oral microbiota revealed that Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum, followed byProteobacteria and Actinobacteria. GP cheese significantly modifies oral pH,causing a shift toward basic conditions which are kept for a few hours. TheStreptococcus mutans/Streptococcus sanguinis ratio lowers in the last observedtimepoint. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that a portion of GP cheese eaten afterdinner provides important micronutrients (i.e. calcium, vitamins and someaminoacids such as arginine) and changes oral pH toward basic conditions,resulting in a light modification of the oral microbiome towards the reduction ofthe overall amount of acidophilic bacteria. Furthermore, the S. mutans/S.sanguinis ratio is reduced, contributing to obtain a more protecting environment towards caries establishment and evolution.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused theworldwide spread of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), and till now, it hascaused death to more than 6.2 million people. Although various vaccines and drug candidates are being tested globally with limited to moderate success, acomprehensive therapeutic cure is yet to be achieved. In this study, we appliedcomputational drug repurposing methods complemented with the analyses of thealready existing gene expression data to find better therapeutics in treatmentand recovery. Primarily, we identified the most crucial proteins of SARS-CoV-2and host human cells responsible for viral infection and host response. Anin-silico screening of the existing drugs was performed against the crucialproteins for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and a few existing drugs were shortlisted.Further, we analyzed the gene expression data of SARS-CoV-2 in human lungepithelial cells and investigated the molecules that can reverse the cellularmRNA expression profiles in the diseased state. LINCS L1000 and ComparativeToxicogenomics Database (CTD) were utilized to obtain two sets of compounds that can be used to counter SARS-CoV-2 infection from the gene expression perspective.Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), and Vitamin-A werefound in two sets of compounds, and in the in-silico screening of existing drugs to treat SARS-CoV-2. Our in-silico findings on Indomethacin were furthersuccessfully validated by in-vitro testing in Vero CCL-81 cells with an IC50 of12 muM. Along with these findings, we briefly discuss the possible roles ofIndomethacin and Vitamin-A to counter the SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans.

AB  - The objective of this study was to explore the protective mechanism of Vitamin E (VE) and selenium (Se) against T-2 toxin-induced oxidative damage of bovineLeydig cells. Leydig cells were isolated, cultured and divided into fivetreatment groups such as: control, T-2, Se + T-2, VE + T-2 and VE + Se + T-2.After treatment for 24 h, the cells and supernatants were harvested to examinethe cell viability, the activities and mRNA expression of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), the content ofmalondialdehyde (MDA) and DNA damage. Results showed that T-2 toxin exposuresignificantly reduced the cell viability, increased the MDA level, reducedGSH-Px, SOD and CAT activities and increased DNA damage (P < 0.05). Meanwhile,T-2 toxin was attributed to the down-regulation of the mRNA expression of GSH-Px,SOD and CAT (P < 0.05). However, VE and Se reduced T-2 toxin-induced oxidativedamage and tended to maintain normal levels (P < 0.05). Furthermore, VE and Sesubstantially up-regulated the activities and mRNA expressions of the GSH-Px, SODand CAT. In conclusion, VE and Se, due to its anti-oxidative ability, couldameliorate T-2 toxin-induced cytotoxicities by regulating oxidative stress inbovine Leydig cells.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes a dysfunction of sympathetic nervous systeminnervation that affects the immune system, leading to immunosuppression syndrome(ISS) and contributing to patient degeneration and increased risk of severalinfections. A possible therapeutic strategy that could avoid further patientdeterioration is the supplementation with Vitamin E or trace elements, such asZinc, Selenium, and Copper, which individually promotes T-cell differentiationand proliferative responses. For this reason, the aim of the present study was toevaluate whether Vitamin E, Zinc, Selenium, and Copper supplementation preserves the number of T-lymphocytes and improves their proliferative function aftertraumatic SCI. Sprague-Dawley female rats were subjected to moderate SCI and thenrandomly allocated into three groups: (1) SCI + supplements; (2) SCI + vehicle(olive oil and phosphate-buffered saline); and (3) sham-operated rats. In allrats, the intervention was initiated 15 min after SCI and then administered dailyuntil the end of study. Locomotor recovery was assessed at 7 and 15 days afterSCI. At 15 days after supplementation, the quantification of the number ofT-cells and its proliferation function were examined. Our results showed that theSCI + supplements group presented a significant improvement in motor recovery at 7 and 15 days after SCI. In addition, this group showed a better T-cell numberand proliferation rate than that observed in the group with SCI + vehicle. Ourfindings suggest that Vitamin E, Zinc, Selenium, and Copper supplementation couldbe part of a therapy for patients suffering from acute SCI, helping to preserveT-cell function, avoiding complications, and promoting a better motor recovery.All procedures were approved by the Animal Bioethics and Welfare Committee(Approval No. 201870; CSNBTBIBAJ 090812960).

LID - 10.3390/nu14132763 [doi]
AB  - The Ghanaian population is experiencing an upsurge in obesity and type 2 diabetes(T2D) due to rapid urbanization. Besides dietary factors, vitamin D-relatedgenetic determinants have also been shown to contribute to the development ofobesity and T2D. Hence, we aimed to examine the interactions between dietaryfactors and vitamin D-related genetic variants on obesity and T2D relatedoutcomes in a Ghanaian population. Three hundred and two healthy Ghanaian adults (25-60 years old) from Oforikrom, Municipality in Kumasi, Ghana were randomlyrecruited and had genetic tests, dietary consumption analysis, and anthropometricand biochemical measurements of glucose, HbA1c, insulin, cholesterol, andtriglycerides taken. A significant interaction was identified between vitaminD-GRS and fiber intake (g/day) on BMI (pinteraction = 0.020) where those who wereconsuming low fiber (</=16.19 g/d) and carrying more than two risk alleles forvitamin D deficiency (p = 0.01) had a significantly higher BMI. In addition, aninteraction between vitamin D-GRS and fat intake (g/day) on HbA1c (total fat,pinteraction = 0.029) was found, where participants who had a lower total fatintake (</=36.5 g/d), despite carrying more than two risk alleles, hadsignificantly lower HbA1c (p = 0.049). In summary, our study has identified novelgene-diet interactions of vitamin D-GRS with dietary fiber and fat intakes onmetabolic traits in Ghanaian adults.

TI  - The Role of Vitamin D in Stroke Prevention and the Effects of Its Supplementationfor Post-Stroke Rehabilitation: A Narrative Review.
LID - 2761 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132761 [doi]
AB  - Hypovitaminosis D is a serious public health problem, representing an independentfactor in mortality among the general population. Vitamin D deficiency may affectup to one billion people worldwide. Recently, the potential association betweenvitamin D levels and stroke has gained increasing attention. Many studies suggestthat maintaining normal serum vitamin D levels is associated with improvement of the cardiovascular system and a reduction in stroke risk. As a neurosteroid,vitamin D influences brain development and function and immunomodulation andaffects brain neuroplasticity. It supports many processes that maintainhomeostasis in the body. As stroke is the second most common cause of deathworldwide, more studies are needed to confirm the positive effects of vitamin Dsupplementation, its dosage at different stages of the disease, method ofdetermination, and effect on stroke onset and recovery. Many studies on strokesurvivors indicate that serum vitamin D levels only offer insignificant benefits and are not beneficial to recovery. This review article aims to highlight recent publications that have examined the potential of vitamin D supplementation toimprove rehabilitation outcomes in stroke survivors. Particular attention hasbeen paid to stroke prevention.

TI  - Temporal Association of Reduced Serum Vitamin D with COVID-19 Infection: TwoSingle-Institution Case-Control Studies.
LID - 2757 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132757 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: Vitamin D supplementation has been proposed for the preventionand treatment of COVID-19, but it is not clear if reduced serum vitamin Dpredisposes individuals to COVID-19 and/or is a secondary consequence ofinfection. This study assessed the temporal association between serum vitamin Dand COVID-19 with two single-institution case-control studies through theUniversity of California San Diego (UCSD) Health System. (2) Methods: This study included patients who tested positive for COVID-19 from 1 January to 30 September2020 with serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D) measured within 180 days ofdiagnosis. Patients were separated based on whether 25(OH)D was measured before(n = 107 cases, 214 controls) or after (n = 203 cases, 406 controls) COVID-19diagnosis. COVID-19 infection status was the outcome variable in thepre-diagnosis study, whereas serum 25(OH)D level was the outcome variable in the post-diagnosis study. (3) Results: Serum 25(OH)D levels were not associated with the odds of subsequent COVID-19 infection (OR 1.0, 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.0, p = 0.98).However, COVID-19-positive individuals had serum 25(OH)D measurements that were2.7 ng/mL lower than the controls (95% CI: -5.2 to -0.2, p = 0.03). (4)Conclusions: In our study population, serum 25(OH)D levels were not associatedwith the risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection but were reduced in subjects after COVID-19 infection. These results support the possibility that reduced serum25(OH)D is a consequence and not a cause of COVID-19 infection.

TI  - Nicotinamide Riboside and Dihydronicotinic Acid Riboside Synergistically IncreaseIntracellular NAD(+) by Generating Dihydronicotinamide Riboside.
LID - 2752 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132752 [doi]
AB  - Through evolution, eukaryote organisms have developed the ability to usedifferent molecules as independent precursors to generate nicotinamide adeninedinucleotide (NAD(+)), an essential molecule for life. However, whether thesedifferent precursors act in an additive or complementary manner is not truly wellunderstood. Here, we have evaluated how combinations of different NAD(+)precursors influence intracellular NAD(+) levels. We identified dihydronicotinic acid riboside (NARH) as a new NAD(+) precursor in hepatic cells. Second, wedemonstrate how NARH, but not any other NAD(+) precursor, can act synergisticallywith nicotinamide riboside (NR) to increase NAD(+) levels in cultured cells andin mice. Finally, we demonstrate that the large increase in NAD(+) prompted bythe combination of these two precursors is due to their chemical interaction and conversion to dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH). Altogether, this workdemonstrates for the first time that NARH can act as a NAD(+) precursor inmammalian cells and how different NAD(+) precursors can interact and influenceeach other when co-administered.

TI  - Dietary Supplement Use in Relation to Socio-Demographic and Lifestyle Factors,including Adherence to Mediterranean-Style Diet in University Students.
LID - 2745 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132745 [doi]
AB  - The study aimed to examine socio-demographic and lifestyle determinants,including diet quality, of dietary supplement (DS) use among 2545 students whoattended public universities in Warsaw. The data was collected using aself-administered health and lifestyle questionnaire and a 5-day dietary recordmethod. Diet quality was assessed using a Mediterranean Diet Score. To determine the covariates of DS use, multivariate-adjusted logistic regression models withan estimation of odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) wereused. The results showed that 41% of participants were DS users. The followingpredictors of DS use were identified: gender (male vs. female; OR:0.62, 95%CI:0.50-0.79), physical activity (high vs. low; OR:1.79, 95% CI:1.45-2.20), BMI(>/=25 vs. 18.5-24.9 kg/m(2); OR:0.77, 95% CI:0.61-0.98), cigarette smoking (yes vs. no; OR:0.67, 95% CI:0.52-0.86), and presence of chronic diseases (yes vs. no;OR:2.37, 95% CI:1.89-2.98). Moreover, higher nutritional knowledge, special diet usage, eating more meals/day, and fortified food consumption were determinants ofDS use. Adherence to the Mediterranean-style diet was positively associated with DS use, a 1-score increment was associated with a 10% (p-trend = 0.011) higherprobability of DS usage. Given that the use of vitamins and/or minerals is commonamong university students and their users are characterized by eating a higherquality diet, investigating the contribution of DS in overall dietary nutrientintake warrants further study.

TI  - Gene-Environment Interactions in Vitamin D Status and Sun Exposure: A Systematic Review with Recommendations for Future Research.
LID - 2735 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132735 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D is essential for good health. Dermal vitamin D production is dependent on environmental factors such as season and latitude, and personal factors suchas time spent outdoors and genetics. Varying heritability of vitamin D status by season has been reported, suggesting that gene-environment interactions (GxE) mayplay a key role. Thus, understanding GxE might significantly improve ourunderstanding of determinants of vitamin D status. The objective of this reviewwas to survey the existing methods in GxE on vitamin D studies and report on GxE effect estimates. We searched the Embase, Medline (Ovid), and Web of Science(Core Collection) databases. We included only primary research that reported onGxE effects on vitamin D status using 25-hydroxyvitamin D as a biomarker. Sunexposure was the only environmental exposure identified in these studies. Thequality assessment followed the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. Seven studies were included in the final narrative synthesis. We evaluate thelimitations and findings of the available GxE in vitamin D research and providerecommendations for future GxE research. The systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021238081).

TI  - Effectiveness of Dietary Interventions to Treat Iron-Deficiency Anemia in Women: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials.
LID - 2724 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132724 [doi]
AB  - Iron-deficiency anemia is the most frequent nutritional deficiency, with women ofreproductive age being particularly at risk of its development. The aim of thesystematic review was to assess the effectiveness of dietary interventions totreat iron-deficiency anemia in women based on the randomized controlled trials. The systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines andregistered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42021261235). The searching procedure wasbased on PubMed and Web of Science databases, while it covered records published until June 2021. It included all randomized controlled trials assessingeffectiveness of various dietary interventions on treatment of iron-deficiencyanemia in women of childbearing age. The total number of 7825 records werescreened, while 14 of them were finally included in the systematic review. Thestudies were screened, included, and reported, and the risk of bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials by twoindependent researchers. The included studies compared the effectiveness ofvarious dietary interventions with supplementation, placebo, control, or anyother dietary intervention, while the assessed dietary interventions were basedeither on increasing iron supply and/or on increasing its absorption (byincreasing vitamin C or vitamin D or decreasing phytate intake). The duration of applied intervention was diversified from 3 months or less, through 4 or 5months, to half of a year or more. Among the assessed biochemical measures, thefollowing were analyzed in majority of studies: hemoglobin, ferritin, transferrinreceptor, hematocrit, and transferrin. The majority of included studies supportedthe influence of dietary interventions on the treatment of iron-deficiencyanemia, as the applied dietary intervention was not effective in only threestudies. The majority of included studies were assessed as characterized bymedium risk of bias, while the overall risk was high for only four studies, whichresulted from the randomization process, deviations from the intendedinterventions, and selection of the reported result. The majority of includedstudies were conducted for increasing iron supply and/or increasing vitamin Csupply; however, only for the interventions including increasing iron supply and simultaneously increasing its absorption by vitamin C supply were all resultsconfirmed effective. Vitamin D also seems to be an effective dietary treatment,but further studies are necessary to confirm the observations. Considering thisfact, dietary interventions recommended for anemic female patients should includeincreased intake of iron and vitamin C.

TI  - Women Taking a Folic Acid Supplement in Countries with Mandatory FoodFortification Programs May Be Exceeding the Upper Tolerable Limit of Folic Acid: A Systematic Review.
LID - 2715 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132715 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In preconception and pregnancy, women are encouraged to take folicacid-based supplements over and above food intake. The upper tolerable limit offolic acid is 1000 mcg per day; however, this level was determined to avoidmasking a vitamin B12 deficiency and not based on folic acid bioavailability and metabolism. This review's aim is to assess the total all-source intake of folate in women of childbearing age and in pregnancy in high-income countries withfolate food fortification programs. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted infive databases to find studies published since 1998 that reported folate andfolic acid intake in countries with a mandatory fortification policy. RESULTS:Women of childbearing age do not receive sufficient folate intake from foodsources alone even when consuming fortified food products; however, almost allwomen taking a folic acid-based supplement exceed the upper tolerable limit offolic acid intake. CONCLUSIONS: Folic acid supplement recommendations and theupper tolerable limit of 1000 mcg set by policy makers warrant careful review in light of potential adverse effects of exceeding the upper tolerable limit onfolic acid absorption and metabolism, and subsequent impacts on women's healthduring their childbearing years.

TI  - Influences of Vitamin D and Iron Status on Skeletal Muscle Health: A NarrativeReview.
LID - 2717 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132717 [doi]
AB  - There is conflicting evidence of the roles vitamin D and iron have in isolationand combined in relation to muscle health. The purpose of this narrative reviewwas to examine the current literature on the roles that vitamin D and iron haveon skeletal muscle mass, strength, and function and how these nutrients areassociated with skeletal muscle health in specific populations. Secondarypurposes include exploring if low vitamin D and iron status are interrelated withskeletal muscle health and chronic inflammation and reviewing the influence ofanimal-source foods rich in these nutrients on health and performance. PubMed,Scopus, SPORT Discus, EMBAE, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases were searched to determine eligible studies. There was a positive effect of vitamin D on musclemass, particularly in older adults. There was a positive effect of iron onaerobic and anaerobic performance. Studies reported mixed results for bothvitamin D and iron on muscle strength and function. While vitamin D and irondeficiency commonly occur in combination, few studies examined effects onskeletal muscle health and inflammation. Isolated nutrients such as iron andvitamin D may have positive outcomes; however, nutrients within food sources may be most effective in improving skeletal muscle health.

The viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2, with the emergence of newvariants with in-creased infectious potential, is a cause for concern. Inaddition, vaccination coverage remains in-sufficient worldwide. Therefore, there is a need to develop new therapeutic options, and/or to optimize therepositioning of drugs approved for other indications for COVID-19. This mayinclude the use of calcifediol, the prohormone of the vitamin D endocrine system (VDES) as it may have potential useful effects for the treatment of COVID-19. We review the aspects associating COVID-19 with VDES and the potential use ofcalcifediol in COVID-19. VDES/VDR stimulation may enhance innate antiviraleffector mechanisms, facilitating the induction of antimicrobialpeptides/autophagy, with a critical modulatory role in the subsequent hostreactive hyperinflammatory phase during COVID-19: By decreasing thecytokine/chemokine storm, regulating the renin-angiotensin-bradykinin system(RAAS), modulating neutrophil activity and maintaining the integrity of thepulmonary epithelial barrier, stimulating epithelial repair, and directly andindirectly decreasing the increased coagulability and prothrombotic tendencyassociated with severe COVID-19 and its complications. Available evidencesuggests that VDES/VDR stimulation, while maintaining optimal serum 25OHD status,in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may significantly reduce the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe COVID-19, with possiblebeneficial effects on the need for mechanical ventilation and/or intensive careunit (ICU) admission, as well as deaths in the course of the disease. Thepharmacokinetic and functional characteristics of calcifediol give it superiorityin rapidly optimizing 25OHD levels in COVID-19. A pilot study and severalobservational intervention studies using high doses of calcifediol (0.532 mg onday 1 and 0.266 mg on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28) dramatically decreased the need for ICU admission and the mortality rate. We, therefore, propose to usecalcifediol at the doses described for the rapid correction of 25OHD deficiencyin all patients in the early stages of COVID-19, in association, if necessary,with the new oral antiviral agents.

TI  - Vitamin D-The Nutritional Status of Post-Gastrectomy Gastric CancerPatients-Systematic Review.

LID - 10.3390/nu14132712 [doi]
AB  - Gastric cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract, with one ofthe standard treatment methods remaining gastrectomy. The authors conducted asystemic review of the Medline and Embase databases concerning the serum vitamin D level in post-gastrectomy gastric cancer patients, regarding all articlespublished until 22 May 2022 according to the PRISMA guidelines. 18 studies with atotal number of 908 gastric cancer survivors were included in the analysis. Theinitial rate of vitamin D deficiency in gastric cancer patients undergoinggastrectomy appears to be similar to the global population deficiency. Inpost-gastrectomy survivors, the level of 25(OH)D may remain stable or decrease,while the level of 1, 25(OH)2D remains normal. Supplementation with vitamin Dresults in an improvement in its serum concentration and positively affects bone mineral density, which is gradually reduced in post-gastrectomy survivors.Combining vitamin D supplementation with calcium and bisphosphonates enables usto obtain better results than vitamin D and calcium only. The type of surgeryinfluences the level of serum vitamin D and its metabolites, with total orpartial gastrectomy and maintenance of the duodenal food passage remaining themost important factors. There is a strong need for randomized, controlled trials that would investigate this matter in the future.

TI  - Genetic Variants in Folate and Cobalamin Metabolism-Related Genes in PregnantWomen of a Homogeneous Spanish Population: The Need for Revisiting the CurrentVitamin Supplementation Strategies.
LID - 2702 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132702 [doi]
AB  - Polymorphisms of genes involved in the metabolism and transport of folate andcobalamin could play relevant roles in pregnancy outcomes. This study assessedthe prevalence of genetic polymorphisms of folate and cobalaminmetabolism-related genes such as MTHFR, MTR, CUBN, and SLC19A1 in pregnant women of a homogeneous Spanish population according to conception, pregnancy, delivery,and newborns complications. This study was conducted on 149 nulliparous womenwith singleton pregnancies. Sociodemographic and obstetrics variables wererecorded, and all patients were genotyped in the MTHFR, MTR, CUBN, and SLC10A1polymorphisms. The distribution of genotypes detected in this cohort was similar to the population distribution reported in Europe, highlighting that more than50% of women were carriers of risk alleles of the studied genes. In women withthe MTHFR risk allele, there was a statistically significant higher frequency of assisted fertilisation and a higher frequency of preeclampsia and preterm birth. Moreover, CUBN (rs1801222) polymorphism carriers showed a statisticallysignificantly lower frequency of complications during delivery. In conclusion,the prevalence of genetic variants related to folic acid and vitamin B12metabolic genes in pregnant women is related to mother and neonatal outcomes.Knowing the prevalence of these polymorphisms may lead to a personalisedprescription of vitamin intake.

TI  - Nutritional Description of Foods with Low- and No-Calorie Sweeteners in Spain:The BADALI Project.
LID - 2686 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132686 [doi]
AB  - The use of low- and no-calorie sweeteners (LNCS) in foods has increased in recentyears in response to the negative effects of free sugar on health. However, thehealth impact of LNCS is still unclear. Studies of the prevalence of LNCS infoods have been published previously, including in Spain. However, the use ofhealth (HCs) and nutrition claims (NCs) to promote these foods and a fullnutritional characterization are largely lacking. For this purpose, we used theBADALI database with 4218 foods present in the Spanish market. Our results showthat 9.3% of foods have LNCS (including both intense and polyols). Sucralose and acesulfame K were the intense sweeteners most frequently used (52.4% and 48.2%,respectively), whereas maltitol was the preferred polyol (20.3%). Of all foodswith LNCS, 30% also had added sugar. Many more foods with LNCS presented HCs and NCs than those without. Sugar was the nutrient most frequently claimed in NCs forLNCS-containing foods, whereas vitamins were for those without these sweeteners. NCs compliance with regulation was similar in both conditions (60.1% for foodswithout and 63.9% for foods with LNCS). As expected, foods with LNCS had lesstotal sugar content and energy. Surprisingly, the nutrient profile of yogurtswith LNCS changed completely: less total and saturated fat, whereas more proteinsand sodium. Biscuits with LNCS contained more fibre. The results of our studyreveal that the prevalence of LNCS is becoming high in some food types in Spainand that foods containing LNCS are more frequently promoted with HCs/NCs. Inaddition, it confirms the general reduction in energy and sugar content expected in foods with LNCS. Furthermore, it suggests a reformulation of products beyondsugar content.

LID - 10.3390/nu14132683 [doi]
AB  - The vitamin D and microRNA (miR) systems may play a role in the pathogenesis ofcardiometabolic disorders, including hypertension. The HYPODD study was adouble-blind placebo-controlled trial aiming to assess the effects ofcholecalciferol treatment in patients with well-controlled hypertension andhypovitaminosis D (25OHD levels &lt; 50 nmol/L). In addition to this clinicaltrial, we also evaluated the effects of cholecalciferol and calcitriol treatment on miR-21 expression in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Changes in thecardiovascular risk profiles were evaluated in HYPODD patients treated withcholecalciferol (C-cohort) or with placebo (P-cohort). The miR-21circulatinglevels were measured in four C-cohort patients and five P-cohort patients. Invitro, the miR-21 levels were measured in HEK-293 cells treated with calcitriolor with ethanol vehicle control. Cholecalciferol treatment increased 25OHD levelsand reduced parathormone, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoproteincholesterol levels in C-cohort patients, whereas no significant changes in these parameters were observed in P-cohort patients. The miR-21 circulating levels did not change in the C- or the P-cohort patients upon treatment. Calcitrioltreatment did not affect miR-21 levels in HEK-293 cells. In conclusion,hypovitaminosis D correction ameliorated the cardiovascular risk profiles inhypertensive patients treated with cholecalciferol but did not influence themiR-21 expression.

LID - 10.3390/nu14132680 [doi]
AB  - Limited studies have reported vitamin D status and health outcomes in care homeresidents, a group at risk of vitamin D deficiency. This study investigated serum25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) concentrations in older adults within care homes in Northern Ireland (NI) and its association with musculoskeletal health (ultrasoundT-score, muscle strength, Timed Up & Go test (TUG)), bone turnover markers(BTMs), and immune function markers. A total of 87 participants were recruitedwith mean +/- SD age 83.2 +/- 7.9 years. Mean +/- SD serum 25-OHD concentration(n 69) was 49.52 +/- 35.58 nmol/L. Vitamin D deficiency (25-OHD &lt;25 nmol/L)was observed in 34.8% (n 24) of participants with 17.4% (n 12) classified asinsufficient (25-OHD 25-50 nmol/L) and 47.8% (n 33) as sufficient (25-OHD &gt;50 nmol/L). 25-OHD concentration was not an independent predictor of T-score, musclestrength, TUG, or inflammatory cytokines. After adjusting for covariates, asignificant negative association was observed between 25-OHD concentration andthe BTMs; osteocalcin (beta = -0.395; p = 0.001), procollagen type 1 N propeptide(P1NP) (beta = -0.320; p = 0.012), and C-terminal telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX) (beta = -0.377; p = 0.003). Higher 25-OHD concentration was positivelyassociated with use of vitamin D +/- calcium supplementation (beta = 0.610; p&lt; 0.001). Vitamin D deficiency and insufficiency were highly prevalent in thissample of care home residents in NI. Higher 25-OHD concentration was associatedwith greater supplement use and with reduced bone turnover, which in thispopulation is linked with reduced bone loss. These findings emphasize the needfor a mandatory vitamin D +/- calcium supplementation policy specific for carehome residents.

TI  - Effect of Vitamin C on Tendinopathy Recovery: A Scoping Review.
LID - 2663 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132663 [doi]
AB  - Tendinopathies represent 30-50% of all sports injuries. The tendon response isinfluenced by the load (volume, intensity, and frequency) that the tendonsupport, resulting in irritability and pain, among others. The main molecularcomponent of tendons is collagen I (60-85%). The rest consist ofglycosaminoglycans-proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and other collagen subtypes.This study's aim was to critically evaluate the efficacy of vitamin Csupplementation in the treatment of tendinopathies. At the same time, the studyaims to determine the optimal conditions (dose and time) for vitamin Csupplementation. A structured search was carried out in the SCOPUS, Medline(PubMed), and Web of Science (WOS) databases. The inclusion criteria took intoaccount studies describing optimal tendon recovery when using vitamin C alone or in combination with other compounds. The study design was considered, includingrandomized, double-blind controlled, and parallel designs in animal models orhumans. The main outcome is that vitamin C supplementation is potentially useful as a therapeutic approach for tendinopathy recovery. Vitamin C supplementation,alone or in combination with other products, increases collagen synthesis with a consequent improvement in the patient's condition. On the other hand, vitamin Cdeficiency is mainly associated with a decrease in procollagen synthesis andreduced hydroxylation of proline and lysine residues, hindering the tendon repairprocess.

TI  - Exercise: A Possibly Effective Way to Improve Vitamin D Nutritional Status.
LID - 2652 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132652 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D deficiency has become a widespread public health problem owing to itspotential adverse health effects. Generally, the nutritional status of vitamin D depends on sunlight exposure and dietary or supplementary intake. However, recentstudies have found that exercise can influence circulating 25(OH)D levels;although, the results have been inconclusive. In this review, we focused on theeffect of exercise on circulating vitamin D metabolites and their possiblemechanisms. We found that endurance exercise can significantly increase serum25(OH)D levels in vitamin D-deficient people but has no significant effect onvitamin D-sufficient people. This benefit has not been observed with resistancetraining. Only chronic endurance exercise training can significantly increaseserum 1,25(OH)2D, and the effect may be sex-dependent. Exercise may influence25(OH)D levels in the circulation by regulating either the vitamin D metabolites stored in tissues or the utilization by target tissues. The effects of exerciseon 25(OH)D levels in the circulation may be dependent on many factors, such asthe vitamin D nutritional status, exercise type and intensity, and sex.Therefore, further research on the effects and mechanisms of exercise on vitamin D metabolites is required.

LID - 10.3390/nu14132644 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the association between micronutrient intake and breastcancer risk in South Korean adult women. This association was stratifiedaccording to body mass index (BMI) categories. Data from the Korean Genome andEpidemiology Study (KoGES) and the Health Examinee Study were analyzed.Altogether, 63,337 individuals (aged >/=40 years) completed the baseline andfirst follow-up surveys; 40,432 women without a history of cancer at baselinewere included in this study. The association between micronutrient intake andbreast cancer was determined by estimating the hazard ratio (HR) and 95%confidence interval (CI) using the Cox proportional hazard regression model. Astratified analysis by BMI (&lt;25 kg/m(2) and >/=25 kg/m(2)) was performed. The an analysis of 15 micronutrients and breast cancer risk revealed that none of themicronutrients were associated with breast cancer risk after adjusting forcovariates. In obese women, the risk of breast cancer was significantly reducedin the group that consumed vitamin C more than the recommended level (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.31-0.93) and vitamin B6 levels above the recommended level (HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.25-0.89). In obese women, exceeding the recommended daily intake levelsof vitamin C and vitamin B6 was associated with a lower risk of breast cancer.However, other micronutrients were not associated with breast cancer risk inthese women.

TI  - Dietary Supplements in People with Metastatic Cancer Who Are ExperiencingMalnutrition, Cachexia, Sarcopenia, and Frailty: A Scoping Review.
LID - 2642 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132642 [doi]
AB  - Cancer-associated malnutrition, or cachexia, stemming from cancer or itstreatments, is particularly prevalent in metastatic cancers, and is ofteninterrelated with sarcopenia and frailty. Evidence suggests that dietarysupplements play a role in managing these conditions. As metastatic cancer cells are associated with notable genomic and phenotypic alterations, response todietary supplements may differ between metastatic and non-metastatic cancers.However, research in this area is lacking. This scoping review aims to identifythe dietary supplements that have been studied in patients with metastaticcancers and malnutrition-related conditions, along with their proposed effects,mechanisms, outcome measures, and tools used. A systematic search was conductedacross databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and clinical trialregistries. Of the initial 6535 records screened, a total of 48 studies wereincluded, covering a range of dietary supplements-vitamins, minerals,antioxidants, proteins, amino acids, fatty acids, fiber, and others. While thetypes of dietary supplements included varied across cancer types, omega-3 andcarnitine were investigated most often. Proposed relevant attributes of dietarysupplements included their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer, andimmunomodulatory properties. Overall, there was a paucity of interventionalstudies, and more randomized controlled trials are warranted.

LID - 10.3390/nu14132633 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to assess sleep patterns during the three trimesters ofpregnancy and whether vitamin D concentrations, along with other risk factors,are associated with these alterations. In a longitudinal study, 140 pregnantwomen (age 18 to 39 years) were followed throughout their first, second, andthird trimesters. Sleep was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index(PSQI) at each trimester, along with an assessment of biochemical parameters,including serum vitamin D levels. The information that was collected includedanthropometric data, socio-economic status, dietary intake, and physicalactivity. The PSQI was higher in mid and late pregnancy than in early pregnancy(both p = 0.001), and the sleep duration was also higher in late versus earlypregnancy. Linear regression analyses revealed independent predictors ofdeteriorating sleep quality from early to late pregnancy, including low income (B+/- SE -0.60 +/- 0.26, p = 0.03) and low serum vitamin D levels in the secondtrimester (B +/- SE -0.20 +/- 0.01, p = 0.04). Energy intake and sitting in thesecond half of pregnancy were positively associated with changes in the PSQIscore from the second to third trimesters (B +/- SE 0.15 +/- 0.07, p = 0.048) and(B +/- SE 0.01 +/- 0.00, p = 0.044), respectively. Low socio-economic status, lowserum vitamin D levels, greater energy intake, and sitting time were associatedwith worsening patterns of sleep quality from early to late pregnancy.

TI  - The Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on the Severity of Symptoms and theQuality of Life in Irritable Bowel Syndrome Patients: A Systematic Review andMeta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.
LID - 2618 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132618 [doi]
AB  - Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a gastrointestinal disorder affecting 7-12% ofthe population, is characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and alternatingbowel patterns. Data on risk and protective influences have yielded conflictingevidence on the effects of alternative interventions, such as vitamin D. Thisreview focuses on the effects of vitamin D on IBS. A systematic review andmeta-analysis considered all articles published until 4 April 2022. The searchfor randomized controlled trials assessing vitamin D efficacy in IBS withoutcomes, primary (Irritable Bowel Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS)) andsecondary (IBS quality of life (IBS-QoL) and serum level of calcifediol(25(OH)D)), was performed on six databases, Google Scholar, Web of Science,SCOPUS, EMBASE, PubMed (MEDLINE), and Cochrane Central Register of ControlledTrials. We included six trials with 616 patients. The pooled analysis found nodifference between vitamin D and placebo in improving IBS-SSS (MD: -45.82 with95% CI [-93.62, 1.98], p = 0.06). However, the pooled analysis favored vitamin D over placebo in improving the IBS-Qol (MD: 6.19 with 95% CI [0.35, 12.03], p =0.04) and serum 25(OH)D (MD: 25.2 with 95% CI [18.41, 31.98], p = 0.00001).Therefore, further clinical trials are required to reach clinically applicableand generalizable findings.

TI  - Effect of Cholecalciferol Supplementation on the Clinical Features andInflammatory Markers in Hospitalized COVID-19 Patients: A Randomized, Open-Label,Single-Center Study.
LID - 2602 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132602 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies showed that a low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level wasassociated with a higher risk of morbidity and severe course of COVID-19. Ourstudy aimed to evaluate the effects of cholecalciferol supplementation on theclinical features and inflammatory markers in patients with COVID-19. A serum25(OH)D level was determined in 311 COVID-19 patients. Among them, 129 patientswere then randomized into two groups with similar concomitant medication. Group I(n = 56) received a bolus of cholecalciferol at a dose of 50,000 IU on the first and the eighth days of hospitalization. Patients from Group II (n = 54) did notreceive the supplementation. We found significant differences between groups withthe preferential increase in serum 25(OH)D level and Delta 25(OH)D in Group I on the ninth day of hospitalization (p &lt; 0.001). The serum 25(OH)D level on theninth day was negatively associated with the number of bed days (r = -0.23, p =0.006); we did not observe other clinical benefits in patients receiving an oral bolus of cholecalciferol. Moreover, in Group I, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were significantly higher (p = 0.04; p = 0.02), while the C-reactive proteinlevel was significantly lower on the ninth day of hospitalization (p = 0.02).Patients with supplementation of 100,000 IU of cholecalciferol, compared to thosewithout supplementation, showed a decrease in the frequencies of CD38++CD27transitional and CD27-CD38+ mature naive B cells (p = 0.006 and p = 0.02) and an increase in the level of CD27-CD38- DN B cells (p = 0.02). Thus, the rise inserum 25(OH)D level caused by vitamin D supplementation in vitamin D insufficientand deficient patients may positively affect immune status and hence the courseof COVID-19.

TI  - The Controversial Role of Vitamin D in Thyroid Cancer Prevention.
LID - 2593 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132593 [doi]
AB  - Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and exhibits risingincidence. Annual incidence varies by sex, age, and geographical location. It hasbeen reported that impairment of vitamin D signalling promotes thyroid cancerprogression. Recent studies have shown that vitamin D, a fat-soluble vitamin thatacts as both a nutrient and a hormone, may have utility in the prevention ofautoimmune thyroid-related diseases. However, the precise role of vitamin D inthe pathobiology of thyroid cancer is controversial. Previous studies havesuggested that elevated serum vitamin D levels have a protective role in thyroid cancer. However, there is also evidence demonstrating no inverse relationshipbetween vitamin D levels and the occurrence of thyroid cancer. Furthermore,recent data provide evidence that circulating vitamin D concentration isinversely correlated with disease aggressiveness and poor prognosis, whileevidence of an association with tumour initiation remains weak. Nevertheless, avariety of data support an anti-tumorigenic role of vitamin D and its potentialutility as a secondary chemopreventive agent. In this review, we highlightedrecent findings regarding the association of vitamin D status with the risk ofthyroid cancer, prognosis, potential mechanisms, and possible utility as achemopreventive agent.

TI  - Vitamin D Treatment Prevents Uremia-Induced Reductions in Aortic microRNA-145Attenuating Osteogenic Differentiation despite Hyperphosphatemia.

AB  - In chronic kidney disease, systemic inflammation and high serum phosphate (P)promote the de-differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) toosteoblast-like cells, increasing the propensity for medial calcification andcardiovascular mortality. Vascular microRNA-145 (miR-145) content is essential tomaintain VSMC contractile phenotype. Because vitamin D induces aortic miR-145,uremia and high serum P reduce it and miR-145 directly targets osteogenic osterixin osteoblasts, this study evaluated a potential causal link between vascularmiR-145 reductions and osterix-driven osteogenic differentiation and itscounter-regulation by vitamin D. Studies in aortic rings from normal rats and in the rat aortic VSMC line A7r5 exposed to calcifying conditions corroborated that miR-145 reductions were associated with decreases in contractile markers andincreases in osteogenic differentiation and calcium (Ca) deposition. Furthermore,miR-145 silencing enhanced Ca deposition in A7r5 cells exposed to calcifyingconditions, while miR-145 overexpression attenuated it, partly through increasingalpha-actin levels and reducing osterix-driven osteogenic differentiation. Inmice, 14 weeks after the induction of renal mass reduction, both aortic miR-145and alpha-actin mRNA decreased by 80% without significant elevations in osterixor Ca deposition. Vitamin D treatment from week 8 to 14 fully prevented thereductions in aortic miR-145 and attenuated by 50% the decreases in alpha-actin, despite uremia-induced hyperphosphatemia. In conclusion, vitamin D was able toprevent the reductions in aortic miR-145 and alpha-actin content induced byuremia, reducing the alterations in vascular contractility and osteogenicdifferentiation despite hyperphosphatemia.

TI  - The Increase in FGF23 Induced by Calcium Is Partially Dependent on Vitamin DSignaling.
LID - 2576 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132576 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased FGF23 levels are an early pathological feature in chronickidney disease (CKD), causing increased cardiovascular risk. The regulation ofFGF23 expression is complex and not completely understood. Thus, Ca(2+) has been shown to induce an increase in FGF23 expression, but whether that increase ismediated by simultaneous changes in parathyroid hormone (PTH) and/or vitamin D isnot fully known. METHODS: Osteoblast-like cells (OLCs) from vitamin D receptor(VDR)(+/+) and VDR(-/-) mice were incubated with Ca(2+) for 18 h. Experimentalhypercalcemia was induced by calcium gluconate injection inthyro-parathyroidectomized (T-PTX) VDR (+/+) and VDR(-/-) mice with constant PTH infusion. RESULTS: Inorganic Ca(2+) induced an increase in FGF23 gene and proteinexpression in osteoblast-like cells (OLCs), but the increase was blunted in cellslacking VDR. In T-PTX VDR (+/+) and VDR(-/-) mice with constant PTH levels,hypercalcemia induced an increase in FGF23 levels, but to a lower extent inanimals lacking VDR. Similar results were observed in FGF23 expression in bone.Renal and bone 1alpha-hydroxylase expression was also modulated. CONCLUSIONS: Ourstudy demonstrates that Ca(2+) can increase FGF23 levels independently of vitaminD and PTH, but part of the physiological increase in FGF23 induced by Ca(2+) ismediated by vitamin D signaling.

TI  - Vitamin D and Risk of Obesity-Related Cancers: Results from the SUN ('SeguimientoUniversidad de Navarra') Project.
LID - 2561 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14132561 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is associated with a higher risk of several types of cancer, grouped asobesity-related cancers (ORC). Vitamin D deficiency is more prevalent in obesesubjects, and it has been suggested to play a role in the association betweenobesity and cancer risk. The aim of the study was to analyze the associationbetween vitamin D intake and the subsequent risk of ORC in a prospective Spanish cohort of university graduates. The SUN Project, initiated in 1999, is aprospective dynamic multipurpose cohort. Participants answered a 556-itemlifestyle baseline questionnaire that included a validated food-frequencyquestionnaire. We performed Cox regression models to estimate the hazard ratios(HRs) of ORC according to quartiles of energy-adjusted vitamin D intake (diet andsupplements). We included 18,017 participants (mean age = 38 years, SD = 12years), with a median follow-up of 12 years. Among 206,783 person-years offollow-up, we identified 225 cases of ORC. We found no significant associationsbetween vitamin D intake and ORC risk after adjusting for potential confounders: HRQ2vsQ1 = 1.19 (95% CI 0.81-1.75), HRQ3vsQ1 = 1.20 (95% CI 0.81-1.78), andHRQ4vsQ1 = 1.02 (95% CI 0.69-1.51). Dietary and supplemented vitamin D do notseem to be associated with ORC prevention in the middle-aged Spanish population.

TI  - Acrylamide-Derived Ionome, Metabolic, and Cell Cycle Alterations Are Alleviatedby Ascorbic Acid in the Fission Yeast.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27134307 [doi]
AB  - Acrylamide (AA), is a chemical with multiple industrial applications, however, itcan be found in foods that are rich in carbohydrates. Due to its genotoxic andcytotoxic effects, AA has been classified as a potential carcinogen. With the useof spectrophotometry, ICP-OES, fluorescence spectroscopy, and microscopy cellgrowth, metabolic activity, apoptosis, ROS production, MDA formation, CAT and SODactivity, ionome balance, and chromosome segregation were determined inSchizosaccharomyces pombe. AA caused growth and metabolic activity retardation,enhanced ROS and MDA production, and modulated antioxidant enzyme activity. This led to damage to the cell homeostasis due to ionome balance disruption. Moreover,AA-induced oxidative stress caused alterations in the cell cycle regulationresulting in chromosome segregation errors, as 4.07% of cells displayed sisterchromatid non-disjunction during mitosis. Ascorbic acid (AsA, Vitamin C), astrong natural antioxidant, was used to alleviate the negative impact of AA. Cellpre-treatment with AsA significantly improved AA impaired growth, and antioxidantcapacity, and supported ionome balance maintenance mainly due to the promotion ofcalcium uptake. Chromosome missegregation was reduced to 1.79% (44% improvement) by AsA pre-incubation. Results of our multiapproach analyses suggest thatAA-induced oxidative stress is the major cause of alteration to cell homeostasis and cell cycle regulation.

TI  - The Attenuating Effect of Beta-Carotene on Streptozotocin Induced DiabeticVascular Dementia Symptoms in Rats.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27134293 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the ameliorative effects of beta-carotene (BC) ondiabetes-associated vascular dementia and its action against biomoleculeoxidation. The diabetic vascular dementia (VaD) was induced by administration of nicotinamide (NA; 50 mg/kg; i.p.) and streptozotocin (STZ; 50 mg/kg; i.p.). Thetest compound, BC (50 and 100 mg/kg; p.o.), and the reference compound, donepezil(DP) (1 mg/kg; p.o.), were administered for 15 consecutive days. Changes inlearning and memory were assessed by escape latency time (ELT) and times spent intarget quadrant (TSTQ) in the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The changes inneurotransmitter, i.e., acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and oxidative stress markers,i.e., thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) and reduced glutathione(GSH), were estimated in hippocampal tissue of the rat brain. The administration of STZ caused significant deterioration of cognitive function (decreased ELT and raised the TSTQ) as compared to the normal group. Treatment with BC and DPdiminished the increased AChE activity, TBARS level and decreased GSH levelcaused by STZ. Thus, BC ameliorates the diabetic vascular complications in VaDdue to its potential anticholinergic, antioxidative and free radical scavengingactions.

TI  - Investigation on the Peroxidase-like Activity of Vitamin B6 and Its Applications in Colorimetric Detection of Hydrogen Peroxide and Total Antioxidant CapacityEvaluation.
LID - 4262 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134262 [doi]
AB  - The peroxidase-like activity of vitamin B6 (VB6) was firstly demonstrated bycatalyzing the peroxidase chromogenic substrate 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine(TMB) at the existence of H2O2. The influence of different factors on thecatalytic property of VB6, including pH, temperature, VB6 concentration, andincubation time, were investigated. The steady-state kinetic study resultsindicate that VB6 possesses higher affinity to H2O2 than natural horseradishperoxidase and some other peroxidase mimics. Besides, the radical quenchingexperiment results confirm that hydroxyl radical (*OH) accounts for the catalyticprocess. Based on the excellent peroxidase-like catalytic activity of VB6, thecolorimetric methods for H2O2 and gallic acid (GA) detection were developed bymeasuring the absorbance variance of the catalytic system. Under the optimalconditions, the linear ranges of the methods for H2O2 and GA determination withgood selectivity are 50.0-600.0 muM and 10.0-50.0 muM, respectively. In addition,the developed method was applied in the detection of H2O2 in milk samples andevaluation of total antioxidant capacity of different tea infusions. This studymay broaden the application prospect of VB6 in environmental and biomedicalanalysis fields, contribute to profound insight of the physiological functions ofVB6, as well as lay foundation for further excavation of small-moleculeperoxidase mimics.

TI  - The Health-Promoting and Sensory Properties of Tropical Fruit Sorbets withInulin.
LID - 4239 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134239 [doi]
AB  - Inulin is a popular prebiotic that is often used in the production of ice cream, mainly to improve its consistency. It also reduces the hardness of ice cream, as well as improving the ice cream's organoleptic characteristics. Inulin can alsoimprove the texture of sorbets, which are gaining popularity as an alternative tomilk-based ice cream. Sorbets can be an excellent source of natural vitamins and antioxidants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the addition ofinulin on the sensory characteristics and health-promoting value of avocado,kiwi, honey melon, yellow melon and mango sorbets. Three types of sorbets weremade-two with inulin (2% and 5% wt.) and the other without-using fresh fruit withthe addition of water, sucrose and lemon juice. Both the type of fruit and theaddition of inulin influenced the sorbet mixture viscosity, the content ofpolyphenols, vitamin C, acidity, ability to scavenge free radicals using DPPHreagent, melting resistance, overrun and sensory evaluation of the tested sorbets(all p &lt; 0.05). The addition of inulin had no impact on the color of thetested sorbets, only the type of fruit influenced this feature. In the sensoryevaluation, the mango sorbets were rated the best and the avocado sorbets wererated the worst. Sorbets can be a good source of antioxidant compounds. Thetested fruits sorbets had different levels of polyphenol content and the ability to scavenge free radicals. Kiwi sorbet had the highest antioxidant potentialamong the tested fruits. The obtained ability to catch free radicals and thecontent of polyphenols proved the beneficial effect of sorbets, particularly as avaluable source of antioxidants. The addition of inulin improved the meltability,which may indicate the effect of inulin on the consistency. Further researchshould focus on making sorbets only from natural ingredients and comparing their health-promoting quality with the ready-made sorbets that are available on themarket, which are made from ready-made ice cream mixes.

TI  - Valuable Natural Antioxidant Products Recovered from Tomatoes by GreenExtraction.
LID - 4191 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134191 [doi]
AB  - Lycopene, beta-carotene and omega-fatty acids are major compounds in tomatoeswith known antioxidant activity, capable of preventing health disorders. Theidentification of potential natural sources of antioxidants, extractionefficiencies and antioxidant activity assessments are essential to promote suchproducts to be used in the food, pharmaceutical or cosmetic industries. This workpresents four added-value products recovered from tomatoes: pigmented solidoleoresin, pigmented oil and two raw extracts from supercritical and Soxhletextraction. Different parameters including the matrices of tomatoes, extractionmethods, green solvents and operating parameters were varied to obtain extractswith different qualities. Extract analysis was performed using UV-VIS, FT-IR,GC-MS, Folin-Ciocalteu and DPPH methods. The highest-quality extract was thesolid oleoresin obtained from pomace using supercritical CO2 extraction at 450bar, 70 degrees C and 11 kg/h: 1016.94 +/- 23.95 mg lycopene/100 g extract,154.87 +/- 16.12 mg beta-carotene/100 g extract, 35.25 +/- 0.14 mg GAE/g extract and 67.02 +/- 5.11% inhibition DPPH. The economic feasibility of the threeextraction processes (1:10:100 kg dried pomace/batch as scalability criterion)was evaluated. The most profitable was the supercritical extraction process atthe highest capacity, which produces pigmented solid oleoresin and oil with high content of lycopene valorized with a high market price, using natural food waste (pomace).

TI  - Are Organic Certified Carrots Richer in Health-Promoting Phenolics andCarotenoids than the Conventionally Grown Ones?
LID - 4184 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134184 [doi]
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine the concentrations of polyphenolsand carotenoids by means of HPLC/UV-Vis in certified organic and non-organiccarrots (Daucus carota L.) of two cultivars (Flacoro and Nantejska). The analyzedcarrot root samples contained, on average, 4.29 +/- 0.83 mg/100g f.w. ofcarotenoids (mainly beta-carotene) and 9.09 +/- 2.97 mg/100g f.w. of polyphenols,including 4.44 +/- 1.42 mg/100g f.w. of phenolic acids and 4.65 +/- 1.96 mg/100g f.w. of flavonoids. Significant effects of the production system on thecarotenoids (total) and beta-carotene concentration were found, with higherconcentrations of these compounds generally identified in conventionallycultivated roots (4.67 +/- 0.88 mg/100g f.w.) vs. organically grown ones (4.08+/- 0.74 mg/100g f.w.). There was a noticeable inter-sample (inter-farm)variation in the concentration of polyphenols in carrot roots. Despite a general trend towards higher concentrations of these compounds in the organic carrots(9.33 +/- 3.17 mg/100g f.w.) vs. conventional carrots (8.64 +/- 2.58 mg/100gf.w.), and in those of Nantejska (9.60 +/- 2.87 mg/100g f.w.) vs. Flacoro (8.46+/- 3.02 mg/100g f.w.) cultivar, no consistent, statistically significant impact of the production system and/or cultivar on the level of these bioactivecompounds was identified. More efforts should be encouraged to ensure thatorganic crops reaching the market consistently contain the expected high levelsof health-promoting bioactive compounds, which could be brought through theirshelf-life and all processing steps, in order to meet consumers' expectations andprovide the expected health benefits.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27134143 [doi]
AB  - Since prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in men, thetheranostic approach has become very attractive since the discovery of urea-basedPSMA inhibitors. Different molecules have been synthesized starting from theGlu-urea-Lys scaffold as the pharmacophore and then optimizing the linker and thechelate to improve functional characteristics. This article aimed to highlightthe quality aspects, which could have an impact on clinical practice, describing the development of an Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier (IMPD) forclinical trials with [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T in prostate cancer and other solidtumors expressing PSMA. The results highlighted some important quality issues of the final preparation: radiolabeling of PSMA-I&T with lutetium-177 needs aconsiderably longer time compared with the radiolabeling of the well-known[(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. When the final product was formulated in saline, thestability of [(177)Lu]Lu-PSMA-I&T was reduced by radiolysis, showing a decreasein radiochemical purity (&lt;95% in 24 h). Different formulations of the finalproduct with increasing concentrations of ascorbic acid have been tested tocounteract radiolysis and extend stability. A solution of 20 mg/mL of ascorbicacid in saline prevents radiolysis and ensures stability over 30 h.

AB  - Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent for human African trypanosomiasis, is an emerging ergosterol-dependent parasite that produces chokepoint enzymes, sterolmethyltransferases (SMT), not synthesized in their animal hosts that can regulatecell viability. Here, we report the lethal effects of two recently describednatural product antimetabolites that disrupt Acanthamoeba sterol methylation and growth, cholesta-5,7,22,24-tetraenol (CHT) and ergosta-5,7,22,24(28)-tetraenol(ERGT) that can equally target T. brucei. We found that CHT/ERGT inhibited cellgrowth in vitro, yielding EC50 values in the low nanomolar range with washoutexperiments showing cidal activity against the bloodstream form, consistent with their predicted mode of suicide inhibition on SMT activity and ergosterolproduction. Antimetabolite treatment generated altered T. brucei cell morphology and death rapidly within hours. Notably, in vivo ERGT/CHT protected mice infectedwith T. brucei, doubling their survival time following daily treatment for 8-10days at 50 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg. The current study demonstrates a new class of leadantibiotics, in the form of common fungal sterols, for antitrypanosomal drugdevelopment.

LID - 10.3390/molecules27134084 [doi]
AB  - Compared to conventional agriculture, organic farming is believed to provide ahigher nutritional and health value in its products due to the elimination ofharmful contaminants (pesticides, nitrates, heavy metals, etc.). Numerous studieshave been conducted to show how the production system affects the quality of foodin terms of the content of bioactive compounds. The aim of this study was tocompare the content of some bioactive compounds (vitamin C, beta-carotene, Cacontent) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) number and their bacteriocinogenicactivity in organic and conventional fermented food. Although the results do not provide an unambiguous conclusion regarding the superiority of one productionsystem over the other, the LAB number in organic pickled carrot juice,sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir was higher than in their conventional counterparts.Their bacteriocinogenic potential against selected pathogens was also higher inmost organic products. Organic vegetables contained significantly more vitamin C,and the calcium content in the organic yogurt was higher compared to theconventional version of the product. Relatively similar concentrations ofss-carotene for both production systems were found in carrot juice, while inorganic pickled beet juice, there was five-fold less ss-carotene than inconventional juice.

TI  - Design, Synthesis, In Silico and In Vitro Studies of New ImmunomodulatoryAnticancer Nicotinamide Derivatives Targeting VEGFR-2.
LID - 4079 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27134079 [doi]
AB  - VEGFR-2, the subtype receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) responsible for angiogenesis,is expressed in various cancer cells. Thus, VEGFER-2 inhibition is an efficientapproach for the discovery of new anticancer agents. Accordingly, a new set ofnicotinamide derivatives were designed and synthesized to be VEGFR-2 inhibitors. The chemical structures were confirmed using IR, (1)H-NMR, and (13)C-NMRspectroscopy. The obtained compounds were examined for their anti-proliferativeactivities against the human cancer cell lines (HCT-116 and HepG2). VEGFR-2inhibitory activities were determined for the titled compounds. Compound 8exhibited the strongest anti-proliferative activities with IC50 values of 5.4 and7.1 microM against HCT-116 and HepG2, respectively. Interestingly, compound 8 wasthe most potent VEGFR-2 inhibitor with an IC50 value of 77.02 nM (compare tosorafenib: IC50 = 53.65 nM). Treatment of HCT-116 cells with compound 8 produced arrest of the cell cycle at the G0-G1 phase and a total apoptosis increase from3.05 to 19.82%-6.5-fold in comparison to the negative control. In addition,compound 8 caused significant increases in the expression levels of caspase-8(9.4-fold) and Bax (9.2-fold), and a significant decrease in the Bcl-2 expressionlevel (3-fold). The effects of compound 8 on the levels of the immunomodulatoryproteins (TNF-alpha and IL-6) were examined. There was a marked decrease in thelevel of TNF-alpha (92.37%) compared to the control (82.47%) and anon-significant reduction in the level of IL-6. In silico docking, moleculardynamics simulations, and MM-PBSA studies revealed the high affinity, the correctbinding, and the optimum dynamics of compound 8 inside the active site ofVEGFR-2. Finally, in silico ADMET and toxicity studies indicated acceptablevalues of drug-likeness. In conclusion, compound 8 has emerged as a promisinganti-proliferative agent targeting VEGFR-2 with significant apoptotic andimmunomodulatory effects.

TI  - The Role of Vitamin D in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and Acute Kidney Injury.
LID - 7368 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23137368 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D has been described as an essential nutrient and hormone, which cancause nuclear, non-genomic, and mitochondrial effects. Vitamin D not onlycontrols the transcription of thousands of genes, directly or indirectly through the modulation of calcium fluxes, but it also influences the cell metabolism and maintenance specific nuclear programs. Given its broad spectrum of activity andmultiple molecular targets, a deficiency of vitamin D can be involved in manypathologies. Vitamin D deficiency also influences mortality and multiple outcomesin chronic kidney disease (CKD). Active and native vitamin D serum levels arealso decreased in critically ill patients and are associated with acute kidneyinjury (AKI) and in-hospital mortality. In addition to regulating calcium andphosphate homeostasis, vitamin D-related mechanisms regulate adaptive and innate immunity. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectionshave a role in excessive proinflammatory cell recruitment and cytokine release,which contribute to alveolar and full-body endothelial damage. AKI is one of the most common extrapulmonary manifestations of severe coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19). There are also some correlations between the vitamin D level andCOVID-19 severity via several pathways. Proper vitamin D supplementation may bean attractive therapeutic strategy for AKI and has the benefits of low cost andlow risk of toxicity and side effects.

TI  - Molecular Basis Underlying the Therapeutic Potential of Vitamin D for theTreatment of Depression and Anxiety.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23137077 [doi]
AB  - Major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders are common and disablingconditions that affect millions of people worldwide. Despite being differentdisorders, symptoms of depression and anxiety frequently overlap in individuals, making them difficult to diagnose and treat adequately. Therefore, compoundscapable of exerting beneficial effects against both disorders are of specialinterest. Noteworthily, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with anincreased risk of developing depression and anxiety, and individuals with thesepsychiatric conditions have low serum levels of this vitamin. Indeed, in the lastfew years, vitamin D has gained attention for its many functions that go beyondits effects on calcium-phosphorus metabolism. Particularly, antioxidant,anti-inflammatory, pro-neurogenic, and neuromodulatory properties seem tocontribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Therefore, in thisreview, we highlight the main mechanisms that may underlie the potentialantidepressant and anxiolytic effects of vitamin D. In addition, we discusspreclinical and clinical studies that support the therapeutic potential of thisvitamin for the management of these disorders.

LID - 10.3390/ijms23136948 [doi]
AB  - Early life stage folate status may influence neurodevelopment in offspring. Thedevelopmental origin of health and disease highlights the importance of theperiod of the first 1000 days (from conception to 2 years) of life. This studyaimed to evaluate the effect of early life stage folic acid deficiency on de novotelomere synthesis, neurobehavioral development, and the cognitive function ofoffspring rats. The rats were divided into three diet treatment groups:folate-deficient, folate-normal, and folate-supplemented. They were fed thecorresponding diet from 5 weeks of age to the end of the lactation period. After weaning, the offspring rats were still fed with the corresponding diet for up to 100 days. Neurobehavioral tests, folic acid and homocysteine (Hcy) levels,relative telomere length in brain tissue, and uracil incorporation in telomere inoffspring were measured at different time points. The results showed that folicacid deficiency decreased the level of folic acid, increased the level of Hcy of brain tissue in offspring, increased the wrong incorporation of uracil intotelomeres, and hindered de novo telomere synthesis. However, folic acidsupplementation increased the level of folic acid, reduced the level of Hcy ofbrain tissue in offspring, reduced the wrong incorporation of uracil intotelomeres, and protected de novo telomere synthesis of offspring, which wasbeneficial to the development of early sensory-motor function, spatial learning, and memory in adolescence and adulthood. In conclusion, early life stage folicacid deficiency had long-term inhibiting effects on neurodevelopment andcognitive function in offspring.

TI  - Seventy-Two-Hour LRRK2 Kinase Activity Inhibition Increases Lysosomal GBAExpression in H4, a Human Neuroglioma Cell Line.
LID - 6935 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23136935 [doi]
AB  - Mutations in LRRK2 and GBA1 are key contributors to genetic risk of developingParkinson's disease (PD). To investigate how LRRK2 kinase activity interacts withGBA and contributes to lysosomal dysfunctions associated with the pathology ofPD. The activity of the lysosomal enzyme beta-Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) wasassessed in a human neuroglioma cell model treated with two selective inhibitors of LRKK2 kinase activity (LRRK2-in-1 and MLi-2) and a GCase irreversibleinhibitor, condutirol-beta-epoxide (CBE), under 24 and 72 h experimentalconditions. We observed levels of GCase activity comparable to controls inresponse to 24 and 72 h treatments with LRRK2-in-1 and MLi-2. However, GBAprotein levels increased upon 72 h treatment with LRRK2-in-1. Moreover, LC3-IIprotein levels were increased after both 24 and 72 h treatments with LRRK2-in-1, suggesting an activation of the autophagic pathway. These results highlight apossible regulation of lysosomal function through the LRRK2 kinase domain andsuggest an interplay between LRRK2 kinase activity and GBA. Although furtherinvestigations are needed, the enhancement of GCase activity might restore thedefective protein metabolism seen in PD.

LID - 10.3390/ijerph19137826 [doi]
AB  - The use of regular supplementation may be important in alleviating the potential effects of specific nutrient deficiencies. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the socio-economic and lifestyle factors influencing theadministration of dietary supplements to schoolchildren from the Malopolskievoivodship. The study was conducted in March-June 2018 on 332 healthy childrenand adolescents (187 boys, 145 girls) aged 7-14 from the city and municipality ofNiepolomice and the city of Krakow. The mean age of the subjects was 10.35 + 1.64years. In order to assess their diet, a questionnaire was completed, by theparents or the child, on the frequency of consumption of specific products andfoods (Food Frequency Questionnaire, FFQ) with added questions on the supplementsprovided. In assessing nutritional status, basic anthropometric measurements weretaken and the BMI index was analysed. To check which factors influenced the useof supplements among respondents, the odds ratio (OR) was calculated.Approximately one-third of the total number of subjects (33.8%) took dietarysupplements, most often supplements containing vitamins D and C, followed bymultivitamin supplements and omega-3 fatty acids. The least common supplementscontained calcium and iron. Dietary supplement intake was significantly higheramong children living in rural areas compared to city areas (39.3% vs. 26.5% ofrespondents; p = 0.0150), and among boys compared to girls (37.3% vs. 27.8%; p = 0.048). It was observed that children more often received dietary supplements in multigenerational families and in families where at least one parent did notwork. This is related to the place of residence of the respondent. Awareness ofthe need for, and the safe use of, dietary supplements is necessary among parentsof children and adolescents.

AB  - Oxidative potential (OP) of particulate matter (PM) is gaining strong interest asa promising health exposure metric. This study investigated OP of a large set of PM10 and PM2.5 samples collected at five urban and background sites near Milan(Italy), one of the largest and most polluted urban areas in Europe, afflictedwith high particle levels. OP responses from two acellular assays, based onascorbic acid (AA) and dithiothreitol (DTT), were combined with atmosphericdetailed composition to examine any possible feature in OP with PM size fraction,spatial and seasonal variations. A general association of volume-normalized OPwith PM mass was found; this association may be related to the clear seasonality observed, whereby there was higher OP activity in wintertime at all investigated sites. Univariate correlations were used to link OP with the concentrations ofthe major chemical markers of vehicular and biomass burning emissions. Of the twoassays, AA was particularly sensitive towards transition metals in coarseparticles released from vehicular traffic. The results obtained confirm that the responses from the two assays and their relationship with atmospheric pollutants are assay- and location-dependent, and that their combination is thereforehelpful to singling out the PM redox-active compounds driving its oxidativeproperties.

LID - 2120 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11132120 [doi]
AB  - Physical inactivity or prolonged bed rest (BR) induces muscle deconditioning inold and young subjects and can increase the cardiovascular disease risk (CVD)with dysregulation of the lipemic profile. Nutritional interventions, combiningmolecules such as polyphenols, vitamins and essential fatty acids, can influence some metabolic features associated with physical inactivity and decrease thereactive oxidative and nitrosative stress (RONS). The aim of this study was todetect circulating molecules correlated with BR in serum of healthy male subjectsenrolled in a 60-day BR protocol to evaluate a nutritional intervention with anantioxidant cocktail as a disuse countermeasure (Toulouse COCKTAIL study). Theserum proteome, sphingolipidome and nitrosoproteome were analyzed adoptingdifferent mass spectrometry-based approaches. Results in placebo-treated BRsubjects indicated a marked decrease of proteins associated with high-densitylipoproteins (HDL) involved in lipemic homeostasis not found in thecocktail-treated BR group. Moreover, long-chain ceramides decreased whilesphingomyelin increased in the BR cocktail-treated group. In placebo, the ratioof S-nitrosylated/total protein increased for apolipoprotein D and severalproteins were over-nitrosylated. In cocktail-treated BR subjects, the majority ofprotein showed a pattern of under-nitrosylation, except for ceruloplasmin andhemopexin, which were over-nitrosylated. Collectively, data indicate a positiveeffect of the cocktail in preserving lipemic and RONS homeostasis in extendeddisuse conditions.

TI  - Maternal Vitamin D Deficiency in Mice Increases White Adipose Tissue Inflammationin Offspring.
LID - 2024 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cells11132024 [doi]
AB  - Vitamin D is acknowledged to play an important biological and metabolic role inadipose tissue, which is also the main storage site for this vitamin. Itsanti-inflammatory effect in adipocytes and adipose tissue has notably beenhighlighted in adult mice. This vitamin is also crucial during fetal development since maternal vitamin D deficiency is suspected to program future metabolicdisorders. Based on these observations, the aim of this study was to evaluate theconsequences of maternal vitamin D deficiency (VDD) on white adipose tissueinflammation in adult offspring fed with normal or obesogenic diet (high-fatdiet). White adipose tissue morphology, RNA and miRNA expression profiles, andsignaling pathways were studied in adult males and females. In males, a HF dietcoupled with maternal VDD increased expression of RNA and miRNA linked toinflammation leading to over-representation of inflammatory pathways.Interestingly, genomic and epigenetic profiles were associated with activation ofthe NF-kB signaling pathway and adiposity index. In females, no major modulation of inflammatory pathways was observed under VDD, contrarily to males. Weconcluded that maternal VDD coupled with HF diet activated inflammatory pathwayin adipose tissue of the offspring, in a sex-dependent manner. Such activation isstrongly related to activation of NF-kB signaling and increased adiposity only inmales.

TI  - Metabolic Profiling of Bulgarian Potato Cultivars.
LID - 1981 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11131981 [doi]
AB  - Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) are the fourth most economically important cropin the world. They have a short period of vegetation and are an excellent source of carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins, organic acids, minerals and phenolics asantioxidant substances. Potato can be a major dietary source of various bioactivecompounds. In this study, we applied gas chromatography coupled with massspectrometry (GC-MS) metabolite profiling to classify eight Bulgarian potatocultivars bred in the Maritsa Vegetable Crops Research Institute (VCRI), Plovdiv,according to their metabolite contents. Altogether, we determine theirflavonoids/phenolics to evaluate their nutritive quality for the breeding programwith the target of determining strong health-promoting compounds. The "Kalina"cultivar is highlighted as the best one with the highest number of metabolites,containing 14 out of the 26 evaluated; it was selected as the highest-qualitycultivar, compared with the other seven cultivars studied. According to thegrouping of the cultivars in principal component analysis PCA, their positivedistribution is explained mainly by them having the highest contents ofaminobutyric and isocitric acids, methionine and alanine and lower levels offumaric acid, pyroglutamic acid and glycine, in contrast to the cultivarsdistributed negatively, which had high contents of carbohydrates and relativelylow contents of most of the amino acids. The highest number of amino acids wasfound in the cultivar "Kalina", followed by "Perun" and "Bor". The highest numberof carbohydrates was found in "Pavelsko" and "Iverce", while the prominentaccumulation of organic acids was found in "Kalina", "Bor" and "Rozhen". Thehighest number of flavonoids in the flesh of the tubers was found in thecultivars "Nadezhda" and "Pavelsko", followed by "Bor". The highest ratio offlavonoids/phenolics in the flesh was found in "Pavelsko" and in "Nadezhda",followed by "Iverce".

LID - 1972 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11131972 [doi]
AB  - Currently, foods and beverages with healthy and functional properties, especiallythose that claim to prevent chronic diseases, are receiving more and moreinterest. As a result, numerous foods and beverages have been launched onto themarket. Among the products with enhanced properties, vinegar and fermentedbeverages have a high potential for growth. Date palm fruits are a versatile raw material rich in sugars, dietary fibers, minerals, vitamins, and phenoliccompounds; thus, they are widely used for food production, including date juice, jelly, butter, and fermented beverages, such as wine and vinegar. Furthermore,their composition makes them suitable for the formulation of functional foods andbeverages. Microbial transformations of date juice include alcoholic fermentationfor producing wine as an end-product, or as a substrate for acetic fermentation. Lactic fermentation is also documented for transforming date juice and syrup.However, in terms of acetic acid bacteria, little evidence is available on theexploitation of date juice by acetic and gluconic fermentation for producingbeverages. This review provides an overview of date fruit's composition, therelated health benefits for human health, vinegar and date-based fermentednon-alcoholic beverages obtained by acetic acid bacteria fermentation.

TI  - Control of Enzymatic Browning in Strawberry, Apple, and Pear by Physical FoodPreservation Methods: Comparing Ultrasound and High-Pressure Inactivation ofPolyphenoloxidase.
LID - 1942 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11131942 [doi]
AB  - Polyphenoloxidase (PPO) enzyme can be found in fruits, vegetables andcrustaceans. Its activity, promoted by oxygen, causes food browning withsubsequent loss of quality and limited shelf life. Foods are pasteurized withconventional and novel physical methods to inactivate spoilage enzymes, thusavoiding the addition of unhealthy chemical preservatives. Ultrasound and high-pressure processing (HPP) are non-thermal technologies capable of retainingvitamins, bioactives and sensory components of fresh fruits. Enzyme residualactivity vs. processing time were plotted for strawberry, apple, and pear purees subjected to thermosonication (1.3 W/g-71 degrees C), HPP-thermal (600 MPa-71degrees C) and heat treatment alone at 71 degrees C. The PPO residual activities after treatments were highly variable. TS was the most effective for inactivatingPPO, followed by thermal processing. HPP-thermal did not improve the inactivationcompared with thermal treatment at 71 degrees C. The resistance of the threefruits' PPOs exhibited the same pattern for the three technologies: pear PPO was the most resistant enzyme, followed by apple PPO and, lastly, strawberry PPO.However, the resistance of the three PPOs to TS was lower and very similar. Giventhe huge variability of PPO resistance, it is important to run inactivation testsfor different fruits/cultivars. The results can assist manufacturers to avoidbrowning during processing, storage and distribution of fruit purees, juices and concentrates.

TI  - Fabrication of Dragee Containing Spirulina platensis Microalgae to Enrich CornSnack and Evaluate Its Sensorial, Physicochemical and Nutritional Properties.
LID - 1909 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/foods11131909 [doi]
AB  - In this work, the possibility of enriching snacks with Spirulina palatensis (SP) powder as a dragee was studied. In dragee formulation, the effects of variouslevels of SP, sunflower oil, NaCl and sour whey powder on sensory,physicochemical and nutritional properties were investigated. The drageeformulation was optimized and the characteristics of the optimal sample werecompared with the control sample (containing dragee without SP). The resultsshowed that adding SP increased the flavonoids, total anthocyanin content,vitamins, protein, minerals, essential and non-essential amino acids and fattyacids, including omega3 and omega6, while decreasing the energy intake. Based on the results, the optimal dragee sample was formulated and prepared with adesirability of 0.955. The correlation coefficient indicated that the effectiveoptimization process and the performance of the model were carried out properly. The addition of SP had a significant impact on all color parameters considered bythe panelists, and the enriched sample was given a very good taste score (75.10+/- 2.923) and an outstanding overall acceptance rate (91.20 +/- 1.549) by thepanelists. Although morphological data from scanning electron microscopy showedthe distribution of non-uniform SP particles relative to the addition of SP inthe extruded product formulation, the preservation of more nutritional propertiesand the good acceptance of sensory evaluators indicated the success of theapplication in dragee formulation. Therefore, instead of being utilized in anextruder, we discovered that SP may be used as a dragee for snack fortification.

LID - 10.3390/foods11131838 [doi]
AB  - The highly nutritional caja fruit (Spondias mombin L.) is an accessible source ofvitamins and antioxidants that are indispensable for the human diet. Theobjective of the present work was to study the production of a probiotic cajapulp using Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis B94. Firstly, a kinetic study wasperformed on the fermentation of the caja pulp with Bifidobacterium animalis ssp.lactis B94 to determine the optimum conditions of the process. Growth kineticsrevealed that the ideal time for ending the fermentation would be at 22 h becauseit corresponds to the end of the exponential phase. Both the whole pulp and theprobiotic pulp were characterized for pH, acidity, total soluble solids, watercontent, phenolic content, reducing carbohydrates, ascorbic acid, and totalcarotenoids. Physicochemical characterization revealed similar results betweenthe whole and the probiotic pulp. The stability test demonstrated that theprobiotic pulp is stable and preserved the probiotic attributes of the finalproduct. In conclusion, our results reveal that caja pulp can be considered afavorable medium for the Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis B94 growth andconsequently can be explored biotechnologically for new food products.

TI  - The long-term effect of mTOR inhibition on lipid and glucose metabolism intuberous sclerosis complex: data from the Dutch TSC registry.
PG  - 252
LID - 10.1186/s13023-022-02385-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: MTOR inhibition is an effective treatment for many manifestations of tuberous sclerosis complex. Because mTOR inhibition is a disease modifyingtherapy, lifelong use will most likely be necessary. This study addresses thelong-term effects of mTOR inhibitors on lipid and glucose metabolism and aims to provide better insight in the incidence and time course of these metabolicadverse effects in treated TSC patients. METHODS: All patients who gave informed consent for the nationwide TSC Registry and were ever treated with mTORinhibitors (sirolimus and/or everolimus) were included. Lipid profiles, HbA1c andmedication were analysed in all patients before and during mTOR inhibitortreatment. RESULTS: We included 141 patients, the median age was 36 years, medianuse of mTOR inhibitors 5.1 years (aimed serum levels 3.0-5.0 microg/l). Totalcholesterol, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol levels at baseline were similar to healthy reference data. After start of mTOR inhibition therapy, total cholesterol,LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides increased significantly and were highercompared to healthy reference population. Mean total cholesterol levels increasedby 1.0 mmol/L after 3-6 months of mTOR inhibition therapy but did not increasefurther during follow-up. In this study, 2.5% (3/118) of patients developeddiabetes (defined as an HbA1c >/= 48 mmol/mol) during a median follow-up of 5years. CONCLUSIONS: Hypercholesterolemia is a frequent side effect of mTORinhibition in TSC patients, and predominantly occurs within the first year oftreatment. Although hyperglycemia is a frequent side effect in other indications for mTOR inhibition, incidence of diabetes mellitus in TSC patients was only2.5%. This may reflect the difference of mTOR inhibition in patients with normal mTOR complex pathway function versus patients with overactive mTOR complexsignaling due to a genetic defect (TSC patients).

AB  - AIMS: The purpose of this study is to elucidate the correlation between thyroidhormone, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), vitamin D and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), and to seek the independent predictors affecting disease development. METHODS: The study included 44 T2DM with HT, 94T2DM, and 112 healthy subjects. We investigated some laboratory factors likethyroid hormone and compared the levels. Independent predictors determination by logistic univariate regression analysis were analyzed. The diagnostic value ofthyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and threshold concentration were determined by ROC curve. RESULTS: In T2DM with HT group, levels of PTH, HbA1c were lower andlevels of TSH were significantly higher, when compared with T2DM group. But therewas no significant difference in vitamin D between these two groups. In bothlogistic univariate regression analysis and multiple logistic regressionanalysis, TSH, HbA1c were independent predictors for T2DM with HT. Based on theROC curve, the best cut-off value of the TSH was 4 mIU/L (sensitivity 72.7%,specificity 94.6%, AUC = 0.832) for predicting T2DM with HT in T2DM patients.CONCLUSIONS: TSH has increased risk for T2DM evolving into T2DM complicated with HT, so it is important to monitor the concentrations of TSH in patients withT2DM. Although vitamin D was not the independent predictor in T2DM with HTdevelopment, effect of vitamin D deficiency on the progress of diabetes and itscomplications should be taken into consideration.

TI  - 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ameliorates lupus nephritis through inhibiting theNF-kappaB and MAPK signalling pathways in MRL/lpr mice.
PG  - 243
LID - 10.1186/s12882-022-02870-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lupus nephritis (LN) is a common and serious complication of systemiclupus erythematosus (SLE). However, the aetiology and pathogenesis of LN remainunknown. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2-VitD3] is the active form ofvitamin D, and it has been shown to perform important functions in inflammatoryand immune-related diseases. In this study, we investigated the time-dependenteffects of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and explored the underlying mechanism inMRL/lpr mice, a well-studied animal model of LN. METHODS: Beginning at 8 weeks ofage, 24-h urine samples were collected weekly to measure the levels of protein inthe urine. We treated female MRL/lpr mice with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (4mug/kg) or 1% DMSO by intraperitoneal injection twice weekly for 3 weeksbeginning at the age of 11 weeks. The mice were separately sacrificed, and serum and kidney samples were collected at the ages of 14, 16, 18, and 20 weeks tomeasure creatinine (Cr) levels, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels, histologicaldamage, immunological marker (A-ds DNA, C1q, C3, IgG, IgM) levels, andinflammatory factor (TNF-alpha, IL-17, MCP-1) levels. Furthermore, the nuclearfactor kappa B (NF-kappaB) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)signalling pathways were also assessed to elucidate the underlying mechanism.RESULTS: We found that MRL/lpr mice treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3displayed significantly attenuated LN. VitD3-treated mice exhibited significantlyimproved renal pathological damage and reduced proteinuria, BUN, SCr, A-ds DNAantibody and immune complex deposition levels (P < 0.05) compared with untreated MRL/lpr mice. Moreover, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 inhibited the complementcascade, inhibited the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha,IL-17, and MCP-1, and inhibited NF-kappaB and MAPK activation (P < 0.05).CONCLUSION: 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 exerts a protective effect against LN byinhibiting the NF-kappaB and MAPK signalling pathways, providing a potentialtreatment strategy for LN. Interestingly, the NF-kappaB and MAPK signallingpathways are time-dependent mediators of LN and may be associated with lupusactivity.

AB  - The western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte, is themost serious pest of maize (Zea mays L.) in the U.S. Corn Belt and parts ofEurope. Transgenic maize hybrids expressing at least one of the four currentlyavailable insecticidal toxins from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Berliner,currently the most widely adopted control method in continuous maize, havefaltered due to the emergence of resistance. The resistance mechanisms of WCR to Bt toxins are not fully understood. We identified metabolic profiles ofsusceptible and resistant WCR larvae fed on maize hybrids expressing each ofthree available Cry3 proteins (eCry3Ab1, mCry3A, and Cry3Bb1) targeting cornrootworms and a control non-Bt maize via an untargeted metabolomics approach.Over 580 unique metabolites found in WCR larvae were classified into differentpathways (amino acids, carbohydrates, cofactors and vitamins, energy, lipid,nucleotide, peptide, and xenobiotics). By exploring shifts in WCR larvalmetabolome exclusively by Bt toxins, several candidate metabolites and metabolic pathways were identified in susceptible and resistant larvae that may be involvedin defense against or recovery from Bt ingestion by these larvae. These findings would provide mechanistic insights into altered metabolic pathways associatedwith the resistance mechanisms of WCR to Bt toxins.

TI  - How does a social norms-based intervention affect behaviour change? Interimfindings from a cluster randomised controlled trial in Odisha, India.
PG  - e053152
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053152 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Behaviour change interventions targeting social norms are burgeoning,but researchers have little guidance on what they look like, and which componentsaffect behaviour change. The Reduction in Anaemia through Normative Innovations(RANI) project designed an intervention to increase iron folic acid (IFA)consumption in Odisha, India. OBJECTIVE: This paper examines the effect of theintervention at midline to understand which components of the RANI interventionaffect uptake. METHODS: Using a cluster randomised controlled design, wecollected baseline data and midline data 6 months later from women ofreproductive age in the control and treatment arms (n=3800) in Angul, Odisha,India. Using nested models, we analysed data from three different interventioncomponents, monthly community-based testing for anaemia, participatory groupeducation sessions, and videos, to determine the extent to which exposure to eachof these components accounted for the overall intervention effect on haemoglobin and self-reported IFA use. RESULTS: Overall, residing in a treatment as opposedto control village had little effect on midline haemoglobin, but increased theodds of taking supplements by 17 times. Exposure to each of the interventioncomponents had a dose-response relationship with self-reported IFA use. Thesecomponents, separately and together, accounted for most of the overall effect of treatment assignment on IFA use. CONCLUSIONS: All intervention componentsincreased iron supplement use to differing degrees of magnitude. It appears that a social norms-based approach can result in improving IFA uptake, thoughimprovements in haemoglobin counts were not yet discernible.

AB  - A woman in her mid-50s with IgA nephropathy, sarcoidosis and steroid-induceddiabetes mellitus presented with generalised paraesthesia and spontaneous tetany.She had received denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously 8 weeks previously forparathyroid hormone independent hypercalcaemia.At admission, she had severehypocalcaemia (5 mg/dL), hypophosphataemia (1.9 mg/dL), hypomagnesaemia (1.4mg/dL) and elevated serum creatinine (1.48 mg/dL) with prolonged QTc (correctedQT interval) on electrocardiograph. She initially received intravenous calciumand magnesium followed by oral calcium carbonate and calcitriol. Her prednisolonedose was tapered to 5 mg/day. Evaluation showed secondary hyperparathyroidism(1474 pg/mL) and elevated 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (195 pg/mL). After 1 week oforal calcium carbonate (3000 mg/day) and calcitriol (1.5 microg/day), sheachieved normocalcaemia (8.1 mg/dL).To conclude, denosumab for hypercalcaemiawith renal insufficiency causes prolonged severe symptomatic hypocalcaemia andhypophosphataemia mimicking hungry bone syndrome. It is important to periodicallymonitor for hypocalcaemia after denosumab.

PG  - e0269932
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269932 [doi]
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs) promote HIV-1 transmission by acting as Trojan horses,capturing viral particles, facilitating the infection of CD4+ T-cells. Vitamin D (VitD) has shown to decrease T cell activation, reducing susceptibility to HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T-cells in vitro; however, if VitD decreases viral transferfrom DCs to CD4+ T-cells is unknown. In this study, we co-cultured HIV-1-pulsedimmature and LPS mature monocytes-derived DCs (iDCs and LmDCs, respectively),differentiated in presence or absence of calcitriol (VitD active form), withPHA-activated autologous CD4+ T-cells from 16 healthy donors. In co-cultures ofiDCs and LmDCs treated with calcitriol, there was a significant decrease infrequency of infected CD4+ T-cells, evaluated by flow cytometry. However, p24levels evaluated by ELISA were not significantly reduced in culture supernatants.Moreover, calcitriol-treated iDCs exhibited decreased expression of genesinvolved in HIV-1 transfer compared to the control. Both, calcitriol-treated iDCsand LmDCs exhibit a similar gene expression profile, probably related to atranscriptional balance achieved after long treatment with calcitriol. Sincecalcitriol-differentiated DCs express on their surface a lower amount of DC-SIGN and SIGLEC-1 molecules, widely associated with HIV-1 transfer, suggesting thatthis mechanism contributes to a lower transfer of viral particles by the DCs.

RibBgenerates the four-carbon substrate for lumazine synthase that is incorporatedinto the xylene moiety of lumazine and ultimately the riboflavin isoalloxazine.The reaction was first identified by Bacher and co-workers in the 1990s, andtheir chemical mechanism hypothesis became canonical despite minimal directevidence. X-ray crystal structures of RibB typically show two metal ions whensolved in the presence of non-native metals and/or liganding non-substrateanalogues, and the consensus hypothetical mechanism has incorporated thiscofactor set. We have used a variety of biochemical approaches to furthercharacterize the chemistry catalyzed by RibB from Vibrio cholera (VcRibB). Weshow that full activity is achieved at metal ion concentrations equal to theenzyme concentration. This was confirmed by electron paramagnetic resonance ofthe enzyme reconstituted with manganese and crystal structures liganded withMn(2+) and a variety of sugar phosphates. Two transient species prior to theformation of products were identified using acid quench of single turnoverreactions in combination with NMR for singly and fully (13)C-labeled d-Ru5P.These data indicate that dehydration of C1 forms the first transient species,which undergoes rearrangement by a 1,2 migration, fusing C5 to C3 and generating a hydrated C4 that is poised for elimination as formate. Structures determinedfrom time-dependent Mn(2+) soaks of VcRibB-d-Ru5P crystals show accumulation incrystallo of the same intermediates. Collectively, these data reveal for thefirst time crucial transient chemical states in the mechanism of RibB.

PG  - e29768
LID - 10.1097/MD.0000000000029768 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Vitamin D play a substantial role in immune function, butlittle is known about its prevention in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Adetail bibliometric analysis of the published scientific literature indexed inWeb of Science on vitamin D as a therapeutic option for the COVID-19 patients'treatment is lacking. Thus, the current study was conducted to determine the key bibliometric indices and plot the global research on vitamin D and COVID-19.METHODS: The Web of Science Core Collection database was utilized to retrievepublications on vitamin D and COVID-19. A Boolean search strategy was applied andthe obtained data were exported to Microsoft Excel to generate relevant graphs.Furthermore, VOSviewer software version 1.6.17 for Windows was used to generateco-authorship countries, bibliographic coupling sources and co-occurrence keywordnetwork visualization mapping. In addition, RStudio and Bibliometric online tool were used to generate WordCloud and thematic map, and intercountries relationmap, respectively. RESULTS: A total of 818 publications on vitamin D and COVID-19were included in the final analysis. These publications were cited 10,713 times, with an H-index of 50. The number of publications and citations score from 2020to November 2021 increased from 317 (2423 citations) to 501 (8290 citations).Delanghe JR and Speeckaert MM were the most prolific authors with 13 publicationseach. The most productive journal was Nutrients (n = 63). The most studiedresearch area is nutrition dietetics. The most widely used author keywords wereCOVID-19 (n = 444), Vitamin D (n = 312), and SARS-CoV-2 (n = 190). The NationalInstitute of Health and US Department of Health and Human Services were theleading funding agencies. Harvard University was the most active institution with25 publications. The United States of America was the highly contributing andinfluential country in terms of publications (n = 203) and total link strength (n= 185). CONCLUSION: It was concluded that an increasing trend in the number ofpublications on vitamin D and COVID-19 has been observed. Significantly, themajority of the research has been conducted in developed countries. Mostimportantly, over the time, the direction of research has been changed and therecent trend topics are vitamin D deficiency, risk and infection, and vitamin Dsupplementation based on KeyWords Plus. The use of vitamin D supplement is one ofthe promising therapeutic options for COVID-19 treatment. Therefore, the current study not only highlight the global research trends but also provide standardbibliographic information for future studies.

TI  - [Dietary supplements - a temporary trend or an effective help in the fightagainst obesity and increasing physical performance].
PG  - 219-221
AB  - Dietary supplements are products that are intended to supplement deficiencies in diets deficient in vitamins, micro- and macro-ingredients and biologically activesubstances. More and more preparations appear on the market as a result of thelack of regulations regarding the requirements that must be met by the productbefore being released on the market. People are increasingly reaching for thistype of product, believing in the manufacturers' assurances about theireffectiveness in the fight against excessive kilograms or about increasingefficiency during training. However, supplements do not have to undergo anyclinical trials and therefore it is not entirely safe to use the samepreparations for all people, because an excess of some substances can be evenharmful and cause various side effects. The literature review covered the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Mainly articles appeared after 2013. There are manyclinical studies that directly indicate the toxic effects of some substances thatare found in commonly available dietary supplements on the market. Due toignorance, very often these preparations are confused with drugs because thelabels show similar ingredients. In the case of people struggling with theproblem of excess weight, the best way to get rid of obesity is exercise, ahealthy diet. The diet of athletes should be adjusted to cover the needs of allmicro and macro ingredients. CONCLUSIONS: Due to the growing problem of the abuseof dietary supplements, without finding a deficiency in a given person, we shouldpay special attention to the preparations consumed by patients, bought without a prescription. This can lead to serious disturbances in the proper functioning of the body.

AB  - This work demonstrates a lateral flow assay concept on the basis ofstochastic-impact electrochemistry. To this end, we first elucidate requirements to employ silver nanoparticles as redox-active labels. Then, we present aprototype that utilizes nanoimpacts from biotinylated silver nanoparticles asreadouts to detect free biotin in solution based on competitive binding. Thedetection is performed in a membrane-based microfluidic system, where free biotinand biotinylated particles compete for streptavidin immobilized on embedded latexbeads. Excess nanoparticles are then registered downstream at an array ofdetection electrodes. In this way, we establish a proof of concept that serves asa blueprint for future "digital" lateral flow sensors.

AB  - Microbial interactions shape ecosystem diversity and chemistry through productionand exchange of organic compounds, but the impact of regulatory mechanisms onproduction and release of these exometabolites is largely unknown. We studied theextent and nature of impact of two signaling molecules, tropodithietic acid (TDA)and the quorum sensing molecule acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) on theexometabolome of the model bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens DSM 17395, a member of the ubiquitous marine Roseobacter group. Exometabolomes of the wild type, a TDAand a QS (AHL-regulator) negative mutant were analyzed via Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). Based on a total of 996reproducibly detected molecular masses, exometabolomes of the TDA and QS negativemutant were approximately 70% dissimilar to each other, and approximately 90 and approximately 60% dissimilar, respectively, to that of the wild type. Moreover,at any sampled growth phase, 40-60% of masses detected in any individualexometabolome were unique to that strain, while only 10-12% constituted a shared "core exometabolome." Putative annotation revealed exometabolites of ecologicalrelevance such as vitamins, amino acids, auxins, siderophore components andsignaling compounds with different occurrence patterns in the exometabolomes ofthe three strains. Thus, this study demonstrates that signaling molecules, suchas AHL and TDA, extensively impact the composition of bacterial exometabolomeswith potential consequences for species interactions in microbial communities.

LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e09717 [doi]
AB  - Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.) is a wild herbaceous perennial blooming plant that is commonly known as stinging nettle. It's a common, multi-purpose cropthat's sometimes overlooked. Europe, Asia, North Africa, and North America areall home to stinging nettle. It is a plant that's edible and has nutritional and medicinal properties. Young leaves can be used to make curries, herb soups, andsour soups. The root of the stinging nettle is used to treat mictionaldifficulties associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia, while the leaves areused to treat arthritis, rheumatism, and allergic rhinitis. Its leaves areabundant in fiber, minerals, vitamins, and antioxidant compounds like polyphenolsand carotenoids, as well as antioxidant compounds like polyphenols andcarotenoids. Stinging nettle has antiproliferative, anti-inflammatory,antioxidant, analgesic, anti-infectious, hypotensive, and antiulcercharacteristics, as well as the ability to prevent cardiovascular disease, in allparts of the plant (leaves, stems, roots, and seeds). Stinging nettle improvesfish reproductive performance, making it a cost-effective aquaculture plant.Fertilizer and insecticides can be made from the plants. This review examines thenutritional and pharmacological aspects of stinging nettle, as well as itspossible health advantages. Scientists, farmers, and academicians interested instinging nettle collecting, cultivation, research, and development would findthis review useful.

TI  - Comparison of nutritional status of HIV positive children with homecare andinstitutional care/ orphanage - An eye opener cross sectional study.
PG  - 1923-1928
LID - 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1770_21 [doi]
AB  - Background: Nutrition has an important bearing on the health of Humanimmunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive children. Ascertaining the nutritionaldemands correctly and provisioning the nutritional needs to HIV positive/Acquired Immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) children will go a long way inmaximizing the therapeutic benefits reaped through ever improving pharmaceutical initiatives, and thus, contribute to prolonging the longevity of these childrenwho have a whole life ahead of them. Objectives: To study the nutritional status,including dietary assessment and anemia status of HIV-positive children, andcompare the outcomes among children under homecare (staying with families) andorphanages/institutional care. Methodology: A cross sectional study was carriedout among children between 2 and 15 years who were attending Pediatric Outpatientdepartment (OPD) of a tertiary care hospital in western Maharashtra. Data werecollected from 106 children by the interviewer himself using pretested validated questionnaire along with anthropometric measures and relevant blood tests. A 24-hrecall method was used to collect the dietary intake. Institutional ethicalclearance was taken, and data were collected through informed consent of theparent/guardian accompanying the children. Results: Out of the 106 subjectsstudied, 54 (50.9%) were living in orphanages and 52 (49.1) were living with the family. Out of the 52 subjects of children under caregivers, 48.1% of thecaregivers were unskilled workers and more than half of the subjects had amonthly family income of less than Rs 3,000. About 46.1% of the subjects'caregivers were illiterate. In the orphanage, 28 (51.8%) were males and 26(48.2%) were females; 52 (49.1%) children were living with family of whom 30(57.7%) were males and 22 (42.3%) were females. The prevalence of anemia (86.5%) and undernutrition (61.1%) was more among those living with family compared tothe orphans living in orphanages and the same was statistically significant (P < 0.05). Among the children living in orphanages, the mean intake for most of thenutrients was more across all age groups. Within homecare, the mean nutrientintake of the females for all nutrients was more than the males across all agegroups except 3-9 years, where it was more in males. Overall, all the childrenreceived less of water-soluble vitamins compared to recommended daily allowances (RDA), and the children of age group 5-15 years received less vitamin A and iron also. Conclusion: Adequate nutrition, which is best achieved through theconsumption of a balanced healthy diet, is vital for health and survival for all HIV-infected children. Specific measures to be directed to children underhomecare and measures directed to improve social factors need to be undertaken.

PG  - 891712
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.891712 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Vitamin D deficiency is common, but no data have been reported onvitamin D levels in light chain (AL) amyloidosis. Patients and Methods: In thisexploratory study, stored serum samples from 173 patients with newly diagnosed ALamyloidosis were analyzed for vitamin studies which included 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] and vitamin D binding protein(DBP). Measurements were made by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Kidney survival and overall survival (OS) were assessed in association to vitaminD status. Results: Cardiac and kidney involvement occurred in 69% and 63% ofpatients, respectively. 25(OH)D deficiency (<20 ng/mL) was seen in 56.6% of thepatients and was notably found among patients with heavy proteinuria (96%),hypoalbuminemia (84.3%) and morbidly obese patients (68.3%). Heavy proteinuria(>5 gr/24-h) and vitamin D supplementation were independent predictors of 25(OH)Dlevel on nominal multivariate regression analysis. 1,25(0H)2D deficiency wasnoted in 37.6% of patients and was independently associated with low eGFR andhypoalbuminemia. Progression to ESRD occurred in 23.7% of evaluable patients.Patients who progressed to ESRD had lower serum 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2D levelscompared to those who did not progress to ESRD. On a multivariate analysis,severe 25(OH)D deficiency was an independent predictor of progression to ESRD as was renal stage, while 1,25(OH)2D deficiency was not. Conclusions:Hypovitaminosis D is common in AL amyloidosis, particularly among patients withheavy proteinuria. Severe 25(OH)D deficiency at time of diagnosis predictsprogression to ESRD.

AB  - Objective: To explore the efficacy of combined therapy of Regorafenib withdetoxicating and stasis softening Chinese herbal spleen tonics (DSS-splenictonics) in mid-/late-stage hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: Retrospectiveobservational data of 120 patients were obtained, 60 of which received combinedtherapy of DSS-splenic tonics and regorafenib. Adverse event, overall survival(OS), and time-to-progress (TTP) were analyzed. Synergistic effect of DSS-spleen tonics was found and validated in human hepatocellular carcinoma HCCLM3 cell lineand xenograft mouse models. Results: Combination of regorafenib and DSS-splenictonics also slightly extended the TTP and OS compared with treatment ofregorafenib alone, suggesting DSS-splenic tonics has synergistic effect withregorafenib. Both Regorafenib and DSS-spleen tonics exerted inhibitory effect on cell viability and invasion capability of HCCLM3 cells, and combining both could enhance the antitumor effect. At molecular level, we found that VEGF, HIF-1alpha,MVD, and VEGF2 were all suppressed by regorafenib and DSS-splenic tonics. Theseresults suggest that DSS-spleen tonics function synergistically with regorafenib in HCC by enhancing the regulation of regorafenib on VEGF, MMP-2, HIF-1alpha, andMVD, and may diminish angiogenesis during HCC progression. Conclusion: DSS-spleentonics could exert synergistic antitumor effect with regorafenib via targetingVEGF.

AB  - Objective: Vitamin D is associated with neurological deficits in patients withcerebral infarction. This study uses machine learning to evaluate the prediction model's efficacy of the correlation between vitamin D and neurological deficit inpatients with cerebral infarction. Methods: A total of 200 patients with cerebralinfarction admitted to the Department of Neurology of our hospital from July 2018to June 2019 were selected. The patients were randomly divided into a trainingset (n = 140) and a test set (n = 60) in a 7 : 3 ratio. The prediction model isconstructed from the training set's data, and the model's prediction effect wasevaluated by test set data. The area under the receiver operator characteristiccurve was used to assess the prediction efficiency of models. Results: In thetraining set, the area under the curve (AUC) of the logistic regression model andXGBoost algorithm model was 0.727 (95% CI: 0.601~0.854) and 0.818 (95% CI:0.734~0.934), respectively. While in the test set, the AUC of the logisticregression model and XGBoost algorithm model was 0.761 (95% CI: 0.640~0.882) and 0.786 (95% CI: 0.670~0.902), respectively. Conclusion: The prediction model ofthe correlation between vitamin D and neurological deficit in patients withcerebral infarction based on machine learning has a good prediction efficiency.

TI  - [Comparative Safety Assessment of Ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI and Bevacizumab plusFOLFIRI in Second- and Later-Line Treatment in Japanese Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma].
PG  - 687-691
AB  - The addition of anti-angiogenic agents to cytotoxic agents to improve outcomeshas become the standard treatment for metastatic colorectal carcinoma. In thisstudy, we evaluated the safety of bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI with that oframucirumab plus FOLFIRI in second- and later-line treatment in Japanese patientswith metastatic colorectal carcinoma. Patients who received ramucirumab orbevacizumab as a second- and later-line treatment between January 2016 and March 2020 were included. Treatment regimens, body surface area, dosage, number oftreatment courses, and adverse events( AEs) were evaluated. There were 66 and 17 patients in the bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI and ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI groups,respectively. All patients developed AEs. AEs of grade 3/4 were documented in84.8% and 100% of the patients in the bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI and ramucirumabplus FOLFIRI groups, respectively. Progressive disease was the most common reasonfor treatment discontinuation in both groups. Twelve (18.2%) and 5 (29.4%)patients in the bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI and ramucirumab plus FOLFIRI groups,respectively, discontinued treatment due to AEs. The most common AEs leading todiscontinuation were malaise and decreased performance status. The findings ofour study indicated that both bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI and ramucirumab plusFOLFIRI groups have a high incidence of AEs, and that medical professionals need to be aware of the frequent development of malaise and decreased performancestatus.

AB  - The spectral and luminescence properties of linseed oils with differentbackground have been studied. High informativity of oil fluorophores (phenols,tocopherols, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, pigments) as to their native state depending on the influence of various destructive factors: extended storageperiod of oil (three years), exposure to sunlight for 50 h and contact withtemperatures in the range of 60 masculineC > t > 46 masculineC was registered.It was revealed that: 1. Exposure of linseed oil to sunlight for 50 h and contactwith temperatures 60 masculineC > t > 46 masculineC during the process of oilextraction don't lead to visible changes in the structures of their luminescence spectra and luminescence excitation spectra. 2. Long storage period of oil (> 3years) leads to: (a) decomposition of phenols, tocopherols, polyunsaturated fattyacids (linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic), vitamins (B2, E, carotene), accompaniedby the appearance of emission bands with maxima lambdamax = 350, 370, 390, 425,440, 470, 520 nm, which are attributed to the products of their oxidation,increase of their luminescence intensity and changes in the structure of theluminescence excitation spectra of fluorophores: phenols, tocopherols,polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic) and vitamins (B2, E, carotene); (b) decrease in the intensity of the luminescence bands of phenol, tocopherol, carotene and chlorophyll pigment.

AB  - Biosynthesis of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) using algal polysaccharides is asimple, low-cost, and an eco-friendly approach. In the current study, differentconcentrations of Arthospira platensis exopolysaccharides (EPS) were used tosynthetize AuNPs via the reduction of gold ions. The biologically synthesizedAuNPs (AuNPs1, AuNPs2, AuNPs3) were prepared in 3 different forms through theutilization of three different ratios of EPS-reducing agents. AuNPs analysisconfirmed the spherical shape of the EPS-coated AuNPs. Furthermore, AuNPsprepared by EPS and L-ascorbic acid (AuNPs3) showed more stability than the AuNPscolloidal solution that was prepared using only L-ascorbic acid. Analysis of the antimicrobial effects of AuNPs showed that E. coli was the most sensitivebacterial species for AuNPs3 and AuNPs1 with inhibition percentages of 88.92 and 83.13%, respectively. Also, safety assay results revealed that AuNPs3 was thesafest biogenic AuNPs for the tested noncancerous cell line. The anticancerassays of the biogenic AuNPs1, AuNPs2, and AuNPs3 against MCF-7 cell lineindicated that this cell line was the most sensitive cell line to all treatments and it showed inhibition percentages of 66.2%, 57.3%, and 70.2% to the threetested AuNPs, respectively. The AuNPs also showed abilities to arrest MCF-7 cellsin the S phase (77.34%) and increased the cellular population in the sub G0phase. Gene expression analysis showed that AuNPs3 down regulated Bcl2,Ikapalpha, and Survivn genes in MCF-7 treated-cells. Also, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of MCf-7 cells revealed that AuNPs 3 and AuNPs2 werelocalized in cell vacuoles, cytoplasm, and perinuclear region.

PG  - 11514
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-15551-6 [doi]
AB  - The main focus of our study is to assess the anti-cancer activity of cimetidineand vitamin C via combating the tumor supportive role of mast cell mediators(histamine, VEGF, and TNF-alpha) within the tumor microenvironment and theireffect on the protein kinase A(PKA)/insulin receptorsubstrate-1(IRS-1)/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/serine/threonine kinase-1(AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cue in Ehrlich induced breast cancerin mice. In vitro study was carried out to evaluate the anti-proliferativeactivity and combination index (CI) of the combined drugs. Moreover, the Ehrlich model was induced in mice via subcutaneous injection of Ehrlich ascites carcinomacells (EAC) in the mammary fat pad, and then they were left for 9 days to developobvious solid breast tumor. The combination therapy possessed the bestanti-proliferative effect, and a CI < 1 in the MCF7 cell line indicates asynergistic type of drug interaction. Regarding the in vivo study, thecombination abated the elevation in the tumor volume, and serum tumor markercarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level. The serum vascular endothelial growthfactor (VEGF) level and immunohistochemical staining for CD34 as markers ofangiogenesis were mitigated. Additionally, it reverted the state of oxidativestress and inflammation. Meanwhile, it caused an increment in apoptosis, whichprevents tumor survival. Furthermore, it tackled the elevated histamine andcyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, preventing the activation of the(PKA/IRS-1/PI3K/AKT/mTOR) cue. Finally, we concluded that the synergisticcombination provided a promising anti-neoplastic effect via reducing theangiogenesis, oxidative stress, increasing apoptosis,as well as inhibiting theactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR cue, and suggesting its use as a treatment option forbreast cancer.

AB  - AIM: The present study aimed to prepare a novel lipophilic fraction rich in fatsoluble bioactive from Agaricus bisporus and investigated its impact through invitro and in vivo assessments since the prospective biological activities of fat soluble components from mushrooms are limited. METHODS: Ergosterol concentratefraction (ECF) preparation followed by subsequent characterization of the extractusing various analytical techniques (HPLC-UV, Mass spectroscopy, NMR).Furthermore, the fraction has been evaluated for antioxidant activity, DNAprotection ability, hypolipidemic properties by in vitro specific enzymeinhibition and in vivo animal model (C57BL/6). KEY FINDINGS: The fraction majorlycontains ergosterol (504 mg/100 g dw) and linoleic acid (71.92 %). In vitrostudies showed that the fraction limited free radicals induced DNA damage,exhibited significant free radical scavenging activities (IC50 of DPPH 15.64;ABTS 8.28 mg/ml), and inhibited HMG-CoA reductase activity (IC50 5.03 mg/ml).Further, in vivo study showed that ECF treatment significantly (p < 0.05)improved insulin sensitivity (reduced plasma glucose & insulin, increasedadiponectin) and reduced inflammatory markers (CRP & TNF-alpha) in comparison to high fat fed mice. Furthermore, ECF has significantly reduced plasma lipidprofile and accumulation of lipids in liver. This could be due to down regulationof mRNA expression of lipogenic transcription factors such as SREBP-1c andSREBP-2, and key lipogenic enzyme ACC. Moreover, ECF treatment has suppressedprotein expression of FAS, induced cholesterol clearance by enhancing LDL-Rprotein expression. SIGNIFICANCE: The present work for the first time evaluatedthe synergistic potential of ergosterol and linoleic acid to improve antioxidant defense system and ameliorate obesity associated metabolic dysfunction.

AB  - Granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (GMPs) differentiate into both neutrophils andmonocytes. Recently, uni-potential neutrophil progenitors have been identifiedboth in mice and humans using an array of surface markers. However, how humanGMPs commit to neutrophil progenitors and the regulatory mechanisms of fatedetermination remain incompletely understood. In the present study, weestablished a human neutrophil deficiency model using the small moleculealpha-lipoic acid. Using this neutrophil deficiency model, we determined that theneutrophil progenitor commitment process from CD371(+) CD115(-) GMPs defined byCD34 and CD15 and discovered that critical signals generated by RNA splicing and rRNA biogenesis regulate the process of early commitment for human earlyneutrophil progenitors derived from CD371(+) CD115(-) GMPs. These processes were elucidated by single-cell RNA sequencing both in vitro and in vivo derived cells.Sequentially, we identified that the transcription factor ELK1 is essential forhuman neutrophil lineage commitment using the alpha-lipoic acid (ALA)-inducingneutrophil deficiency model. Finally, we also revealed differential roles forlong-ELK1 and short-ELK1, balanced by SF3B1, in the commitment process ofneutrophil progenitors. Taken together, we discovered a novel function of ALA in regulating neutrophil lineage specification and identified that the SF3B1-ELKaxis regulates the commitment of human neutrophil progenitors from CD371(+)CD115(-) GMPs.

AB  - Camptothecin (CPT), a broad-spectrum anticancer drug, has been extensively usedclinically. However, its hydrophobic properties seriously hinder its antitumortherapeutic effect. Herein, we synthesized acid-degradableFe3O4@poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (Fe3O4@PVP)/gold nanoclusters@zeolitic imidazolateframework-8 composite nanoparticles (ZIF-8CNPs) via a facile method and utilized them as carriers to efficiently load CPT. The excellent fluorescence propertiesof gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) and the photothermal properties ofFe3O4@poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (Fe3O4@PVP) endowed the nanocomposites withexcellent cell imaging and photothermal functions. In addition, the surfacemodification of the composite nanoparticles with folic acid-grafted bovine serum albumin (FA-BSA) enables them to efficiently target tumor cells. OnceFA-BSA/ZIF-8CNPs-CPT are taken up by tumor cells and irradiated with anear-infrared laser, the nanoparticles show a highly effective inhibitory effect against various tumor cells through a chemo-photothermal synergistic effect.Hence, it is conceivable that this acid-responsive multifunctional ZIF-8nanocomposite has promising bioapplication prospects in cancer treatment.

TI  - Update on vitamin C administration in critical illness.
PG  - 374-380
LID - 10.1097/MCC.0000000000000951 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Several studies have recently explored the effects ofintravenous vitamin C in sepsis. We aimed to summarize their findings to provide perspectives for future research. RECENT FINDINGS: Sepsis trials examined 6 g/dayof intravenous vitamin C with or without the thiamine and/or hydrocortisonecompared with placebo or hydrocortisone. Network meta-analysis reported thatintravenous vitamin C, thiamine, hydrocortisone, or combinations of these drugswas not proven to reduce long-term mortality. However, the component networkmeta-analysis suggested an association of high-dose (>6 g/day) and very-high dosevitamin C (>12 g/day) and decreased mortality but with low certainty. Thepreclinical investigations have, however, advanced to much higher doses ofintravenous vitamin C therapy since a scoping review on harm reported thatmega-doses of intravenous vitamin C (50-100 g/day) had been administered without any conclusive adverse effects. In a Gram-negative sheep model, renal tissuehypoperfusion was reversed, followed by improvements in kidney function when amega-dose of vitamin C (150 g/day equivalent) was administered. SUMMARY: Theeffect of intravenous vitamin C in critically ill patients has yet to bedetermined and might be dose-dependent. Clinical studies of very high or megadoses of vitamin C are justified by preclinical data.

AB  - To maintain the health of evacuees, meals provided at emergency shelters shouldbe monitored and improvement measures should be taken where necessary. Time andhuman resources are limited during devastating disasters; thus, the authors have developed the Dietary Assessment Sheets for Evacuation Shelters. This studyexamines whether the quality of meals can be assessed using simple check items onthe Dietary Assessment Sheets. A total of 28 Dietary Assessment Sheets for 98meals provided 16-19 days after the heavy rains in Kumamoto in July 2020 at 12shelters were used in the analysis. Dietitians working for shelters wererequested to fill the Dietary Assessment Sheets and food record sheets providedby the Prefectural Government. If any subitem was checkmarked, it was considered "checked," and if left blank, it was considered "not checked" and divided intocategorical groups. Based on the food record sheets and meal photos, contents of energy, protein, and vitamins B1, B2, and C were calculated for each meal. Energyand nutrient contents were compared between the categorical groups. The studyrevealed that nutritionally poor meals were characterized as those comprisingonly "Grain dishes," those that were not "Boxed meals," and those involving"Self-Defense Forces," "Dietitians," or "Others." Their energy, protein, andvitamin B1, B2, and C content was significantly lower than that of meals withmarks on other checkboxes in the same category. Shelters that provide these mealsshould be given priority for nutrition assistance due to their poor diets. Theresults imply that the Dietary Assessment Sheets could serve as a simple tool to determine the shelters that require nutritional assistance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although vitamin D is widely known as an essential micronutrientduring pregnancy, the exact supplementation dose to prevent maternal-fetaloutcomes remains a question. This study aims to provide a systematic review and ameta-analysis of data from randomized controlled trial on > 2000 IU/day vitamin Dsupplementation compared to 2000 IU/day; and 2000 IU/day compared to placebo, on their effects on the incidence of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus,preterm birth, and differences on birth weight. METHODS: A systematic literature search on PubMed, EBSCO-MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register ofControlled Trials databases was carried out to evaluate randomized controlledtrial studies on the effects of oral vitamin D > 2000 IU/day versus 2000 IU/day; and 2000 IU/day versus placebo, on preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus,preterm birth and birth weight. Risk ratio, mean difference, and 95% confidenceinterval were calculated. RESULTS: There were a total of 27 randomized controlledtrials selected. Maternal vitamin D supplementation > 2000 IU/day had a positive effect only on gestational diabetes mellitus (seven randomized controlled trials;risk ratio = 0.70, 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.95, I(2) = 0). Vitamin Dsupplementation 2000 IU/day has reduced the risk of preeclampsia (threerandomized controlled trials; risk ratio = 0.29, 95% confidence interval:0.09-0.95, I(2) = 0), with no significant difference when compared to > 2000IU/day (eight randomized controlled trials; risk ratio = 0.80, 95% confidenceinterval: 0.51-1.24, I(2) = 31). No difference in preterm birth risk and birthweight after vitamin D supplementation. The quality of evidence varies frommoderate to very low certainty. The risk of preeclampsia and gestational diabetesmellitus after high-dose versus low-dose vitamin D supplementation was the oneswith moderate certainty. CONCLUSION: Vitamin D supplementation > 2000 IU/daymight be important to reduce the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Lowerdose vitamin D supplementation ( 2000 IU/day) seemed adequate to reduce the risk of preeclampsia, with no significant difference compared to the higher dose.

AB  - This study covers a new method and related instrumentation for whole bloodanalysis for medical diagnostics. Two-muL whole blood samples were collectedusing "minimal invasive" diabetes lancet and placed on a thin glass rod mountedon a newly designed BloodProbe. The BloodProbe with the whole blood sample wasinserted directly into a ChromatoProbe mounted on the GC inlet, and thus, nosample preparation was involved. The analysis was performed within 10 min using aGC-MS with Cold EI that is based on interfacing GC and MS with supersonicmolecular beams (SMB) along with electron ionization of vibrationally cold samplecompounds in the SMB (hence the name Cold EI). Our blood analysis revealedseveral observations: (1) Detailed mass chromatograms were generated with fullrange of all the nonpolar lipids in blood including fatty acids, cholesterol,cholesteryl esters, vitamin E, monoglycerides, diglycerides, and triglycerides.(2) The analysis of whole blood was found to be as informative as theconventional clinical analysis of blood serum. (3) Cholesteryl esters were moresensitive than free cholesterol alone to the effect of diet of obese people. (4) Major enhancement of several fatty acid methyl esters was found in the blood of acancer patient with liver dysfunction. (5) Vitamin E as both alpha- andbeta-tocopherol was found with person-dependent ratio of these two compounds. (6)Elemental sulfur S8 was identified in blood. (7) Several drugs and othercompounds were found and need further study of their correlation to medicalissues.

AB  - We found that N-nitrosoaminoanisole derivatives tethered to dyes work asphotocontrollable nitrosonium cation releasers and are converted to potent nitricoxide releasers in the presence of sodium ascorbate. The N-nitrosoaminoanisolederivative 2 worked as a more potent photovasodilating reagent ex vivo thanpreviously reported nitric oxide releasers.

TI  - Characteristics of antioxidant substances and identification of antioxidantpeptides in duck embryo eggs.
LID - 10.1080/00071668.2022.2083942 [doi]
AB  - 1. Oxidative stress in duck embryos undergoes dynamic change during incubation.However, the detailed change characteristics has not been studied yet. Here, weexplored the dynamic change characteristics of different antioxidant substancesin duck embryo eggs during incubation.2. The following trial assayed antioxidant substances, including vitamins E (VE) and C (VC), glutathione (GSH), reducedglutathione (reduced GSH), oxidative glutathione (GSSG), superoxide dismutase(SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px), and malonic dialdehyde(MDA). Five antioxidant peptides (DY1, DY2, DY3, DY4 and DY5) were screened andtheir protective effect on HepG2 cells and their mechanism of actiondetermined.3. The results showed that antioxidant substances underwent a dynamic change during incubation through various mechanisms. Moreover, the T-AOC of duck embryos at different incubation times, firstly increased and then decreased,reaching the highest level on d 15 during incubation. The peptide DY2(TVDGPSGKLWRD) exhibited high antioxidant activity in vitro, and is known toregulate the apoptosis pathway in mitochondria.4. The data indicated that duckembryos can be used for the development of related antioxidant products andpurification of new bioactive peptides.

TI  - Bee bread attenuates the progression of atherosclerosis by activating Nrf2/Keap1 and modulating TNF-alpha/NF-kappabeta-associated mast cell migration and amitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway in the obese rat model.
PG  - 8119-8130
LID - 10.1039/d2fo00949h [doi]
AB  - This study explores the anti-atherosclerotic effects of bee bread in the context of oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis phenomena in an obesity animalmodel, and its vitamin composition. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats wereadministered with a normal diet (Normal group) and a high-fat diet (HFD) toinduce obesity. After 6 weeks, obese rats that received the HFD were treatedeither with distilled water (Ob group), bee bread at 0.5 g per kg per day (Ob +Bb group), or orlistat at 10 mg per kg per day (Ob + Or group) concomitant withthe HFD for another 6 weeks. Bee bread significantly improved atheroscleroticchanges by enhancing the immunoexpressions of Nrf2/Keap1, impeding theimmunoexpressions of NF-kappabeta downstream proteins, and intensifying Bcl-2upregulation, attributed to the improvement in mast cell adherence and collagendeposition in the aortic wall of the Ob + Bb group. We have demonstrated that thetreatment with bee bread attenuates the progression of atherosclerosis throughits inhibition of vascular oxidative stress, and retardation of inflammatoryreaction and apoptosis in obese rats, indicating its potential therapeutictargets for obesity-related vascular diseases. This could be partly attributed tothe components of vitamins such as vitamins A, C and E that are present in beebread, which need further study for the exact molecular mechanism of action.

TI  - Effects of different diets on glycemic control among patients with type 2diabetes: A literature review.
PG  - 2601060221112805
LID - 10.1177/02601060221112805 [doi]
AB  - Background: Globally, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most commondiseases, and the incidence is gradually increasing. Diet management couldimprove the elevated HbA1c levels. Aim: This review aims to examine the effectsof different types of diets on glycemic control in patients with T2DM. Methods:PubMed and Google scholar databases were searched. Reports published from theyears 1991 to 2021 that focused on the effect of different diets on diabetescontrol were selected. Results: All the studies reported that the type of dietcan affect insulin secretion and glycemic control in patients with diabetes. The recommended macronutrient distribution for patients with diabetes is 30% of fat, 45-60% of carbohydrates, and 15-35% of protein. Consuming more or less of thesemacronutrients may lead to changes in glucose metabolism and may affect insulinsecretion. In fact, following alow-fat diet improves glycemic control anddecreases HbA1c levels. Studies reported that a low-carbohydrate diet had thegreatest effect on improving glycemic control and insulin parameters. Alow-calorie diet reduced fasting plasma glucose, while a very low-calorie dietresulted in a long-term decrease in HbA1c level. A healthy diet free of processedfoods and sugar, and rich in nutrients such as fiber, vitamins, and mineralscontributed to maintaining controlled blood sugar and lipid plasma levels.Although studies show a low-salt diet improves blood pressure, which is commoninT2DM, other findings show that restricting salt intake is associated withincreased sugar consumption. Conclusion: Healthy diet with adequate intake ofenergy and low-fat and low-sugar foods can enhance the glycemic control andreduce T2DM complications.

LID - 10.1177/1759720X221105011 [doi]
AB  - Background: Racial and ethnic disparities in osteoarthritis (OA) patients'disease experience may be related to marked differences in the utilization andprescription of pharmacologic treatments. Objectives: The main objective of this rapid systematic review was to evaluate studies that examined race/ethnicdifferences in the use of pharmacologic treatments for OA. Data sources andmethods: A literature search (PubMed and Embase) was ran on 25 February 2022.Studies that evaluated race/ethnic differences in the use of OA pharmacologictreatments were included. Two reviewers independently screened titles andabstracts and abstracted data from full-text articles. Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed.Results: The search yielded 3880 titles, and 17 studies were included in thisreview. African Americans and Hispanics were more likely than non-Hispanic Whitesto use prescription non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for OA. However, compared to non-Hispanic Whites with OA, African Americans andHispanics with OA were less likely to receive a prescription forcyclooxygenase-2-selective NSAIDs and less likely to report the use of jointhealth supplements (i.e. glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate). There wereminimal/no significant race/ethnic differences in the patient-reported use of thefollowing OA therapies: acetaminophen, opioids, and othercomplementary/alternative medicines (vitamins, minerals, and herbs). There werealso no significant race differences in the receipt of intra-articular therapies (i.e. glucocorticoid or hyaluronic acid). However, there is limited evidence tosuggest that African Americans may be less likely than Whites to receive opioids and intra-articular therapies in some OA patient populations. Conclusion: Thissystematic review provides an overview of the current pharmacologic options forOA, with a focus on race and ethnic differences in the use of such medicaltherapies.

AB  - Folic acid belongs to the group of water-soluble B vitamins and naturally exists in multiple forms in a wide variety of foods such as legumes, vegetables, liver, and milk (Iyer and Tomar, 2009; Lyon et al., 2020). It is involved in manybiochemical reactions critical for cell division, such as purine and pyrimidinebiosynthesis, DNA/RNA biosynthesis, and amino acid metabolism (Iyer and Tomar,2009). Mammals cannot synthesize folic acid and thus they must acquire it fromfood. Although folic acid is ubiquitous in foods, folic acid deficiency stilloften occurs due to various causes such as unhealthy diet (Hildebrand et al.,2021; Iimura et al., 2022), disease-related malabsorption (Arcot and Shrestha,2005), medication-related depletion (Arcot and Shrestha, 2005), or vitamin B12deficiency (Fishman et al., 2000). Folic acid deficiency has been associated withseveral health problems, such as anemia (Carmel, 2005; Bailey and Caudill, 2012),cancer (Duthie, 1999), cardiovascular diseases (Wald et al., 2002), neural tubedefects in newborns (van der Put et al., 2001), neuropsychiatric dysfunction(Shea et al., 2002), depression (Falade et al., 2021), inflammatory diseases(Suzuki and Kunisawa, 2015; Jones et al., 2019), and eye diseases (Sijilmassi,2019). To prevent folic acid deficiency, its daily intake (400 mug/d) has beenrecommended for adults in the European Union, and its increased intake (600mug/d) is advised for women before and during pregnancy (FAO/WHO, 2002; IOM,2004). The New Zealand government mandated the fortification of non-organic wheatflour with folic acid in July 2021, and the UK government mandated thefortification of non-wholemeal wheat flour with folic acid in September 2021(Haggarty, 2021).

TI  - Abnormal blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D in critically ill patients: prevalence,predictors, and its association with in-hospital mortality.
PG  - 111
LID - 10.1186/s40001-022-00736-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormal vitamin D is prevalent in critical care settings, but itsassociation with prognosis remains unclear. The study aimed to investigate theprevalence and predictors of abnormal blood 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), aswell as its association with prognosis in critically ill patients. METHODS:Patients aged >/= 18 years who were once admitted to the intensive care units(ICUs) of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2008 and 2019 with at least one measurement record of blood 25(OH)D were included as study population. Baseline characteristics associated with deficient or elevated blood 25(OH)D wereinvestigated by univariable logistic regression analysis. The association betweenabnormal blood 25(OH)D and hospital mortality was examined by multivariablelogistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1091 patients were included.Deficient 25(OH)D (< 30 ng/mL) was found in 790 (72.41%) patients and 17 (1.56%) were with an elevated level (> 60 ng/mL). A younger age, male, comorbid liverdisease, and dialysis were risk factors of deficient blood 25(OH)D, whilecomorbid myocardial infarction, dementia, and rheumatic disease were protectivefactors evaluated by univariable logistic regression. Being admitted to cardiacvascular ICU or coronary care unit were associated with increased risk ofelevated blood 25(OH)D. Patients with elevated blood 25(OH)D showednon-significantly higher hospital mortality compared to those with normal ordeficient blood 25(OH)D (35.29% versus 14.44% and 14.56%, P = 0.058). Afteradjusted for potential confounding factors, elevated blood 25(OH)D was associatedwith increased risk of hospital mortality [odds ratio (OR) 3.80, 95% confidenceinterval (CI) 1.22-11.82, P = 0.021] when compared to those with normal blood25(OH)D, but there was no significant association between deficient blood 25(OH)Dand hospital mortality (OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.74-1.72, P = 0.589). CONCLUSIONS: Thesefindings suggest deficient blood 25(OH)D was rather common in critically illpatients, but was not an independent risk factor of hospital mortality, whileelevated blood 25(OH)D was associated with worse prognosis.

TI  - Emerging role of human microbiome in cancer development and response to therapy: special focus on intestinal microflora.
PG  - 301
LID - 10.1186/s12967-022-03492-7 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on the impact of microbialpopulations inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract on human health and disease.According to the involvement of microbiota in modulating physiological processes (such as immune system development, vitamins synthesis, pathogen displacement,and nutrient uptake), any alteration in its composition and diversity (i.e.,dysbiosis) has been linked to a variety of pathologies, including cancer. In thisbidirectional relationship, colonization with various bacterial species iscorrelated with a reduced or elevated risk of certain cancers. Notably, the gutmicroflora could potentially play a direct or indirect role in tumor initiationand progression by inducing chronic inflammation and producing toxins andmetabolites. Therefore, identifying the bacterial species involved and theirmechanism of action could be beneficial in preventing the onset of tumors orcontrolling their advancement. Likewise, the microbial community affectsanti-cancer approaches' therapeutic potential and adverse effects (such asimmunotherapy and chemotherapy). Hence, their efficiency should be evaluated inthe context of the microbiome, underlining the importance of personalizedmedicine. In this review, we summarized the evidence revealing the microbiota'sinvolvement in cancer and its mechanism. We also delineated how microbiota could predict colon carcinoma development or response to current treatments to improve clinical outcomes.

TI  - C. elegans as a model for inter-individual variation in metabolism.
PG  - 571-577
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-04951-3 [doi]
AB  - Individuals can exhibit differences in metabolism that are caused by theinterplay of genetic background, nutritional input, microbiota and otherenvironmental factors(1-4). It is difficult to connect differences in metabolism to genomic variation and derive underlying molecular mechanisms in humans, owing to differences in diet and lifestyle, among others. Here we use the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans as a model to study inter-individual variation inmetabolism. By comparing three wild strains and the commonly used N2 laboratorystrain, we find differences in the abundances of both known metabolites and thosethat have not to our knowledge been previously described. The latter metabolites include conjugates between 3-hydroxypropionate (3HP) and several amino acids(3HP-AAs), which are much higher in abundance in one of the wild strains. 3HP is an intermediate in the propionate shunt pathway, which is activated when fluxthrough the canonical, vitamin-B12-dependent propionate breakdown pathway isperturbed(5). We show that increased accumulation of 3HP-AAs is caused by geneticvariation in HPHD-1, for which 3HP is a substrate. Our results suggest that theproduction of 3HP-AAs represents a 'shunt-within-a-shunt' pathway to accommodate a reduction-of-function allele in hphd-1. This study provides a step towards the development of metabolic network models that capture individual-specificdifferences of metabolism and more closely represent the diversity that is found in entire species.

AB  - This study aims to deliver Tazarotene (TZR) in a controlled manner to reduceadverse effects in the form of a microsponge-based gel. It adopts the methodologyof a similar study by the undersigned authors with respect to the drugClindamycin. Under both studies, the methodology used is emulsion solventdiffusion. Accordingly, we altered the concentrations of polymer and emulsifierto generate four formulations of TZR microsponges. Additionally, we used twotypes of emulsifiers and two types of solvents to develop two further microspongeformulations. We then studied the physical properties of each formulation, aswell as drug-polymer interactions. Echoing findings from our prior study ofClindamycin, we found that microsponge formulations coded by T1 and T3 hadsuperior production yield and entrapment efficiency, and their particle size was suitable for dermal application. As in the prior Clindamycin study, each of theT1 and T3 microsponge formulations were incorporated into a Carbopol gel andevaluated in vitro. The optimal formulation was found to be the microspongeformulation gel T8, which released 87.63% of TZR over 12 h. No significantinteractions between the drug and excipients were found through Fourier transforminfrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry.

AB  - Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) derived from the gut microbiota is an atherogenicmetabolite. This study investigates whether or not berberine (BBR) could reduceTMAO production in the gut microbiota and treat atherosclerosis. Effects of BBRon TMAO production in the gut microbiota, as well as on plaque development inatherosclerosis were investigated in the culture of animal intestinal bacterial, HFD-fed animals and atherosclerotic patients, respectively. We found that oralBBR in animals lowers TMAO biosynthesis in intestine through interacting with theenzyme/co-enzyme of choline-trimethylamine lyase (CutC) and flavin-containingmonooxygenase (FMO) in the gut microbiota. This action was performed by BBR'smetabolite dihydroberberine (a reductive BBR by nitroreductase in the gutmicrobiota), via a vitamine-like effect down-regulating Choline-TMA-TMAOproduction pathway. Oral BBR decreased TMAO production in animal intestine,lowered blood TMAO and interrupted plaque formation in blood vessels in theHFD-fed hamsters. Moreover, 21 patients with atherosclerosis exhibited theaverage decrease of plaque score by 3.2% after oral BBR (0.5 g, bid) for 4 months(*P < 0.05, n = 21); whereas the plaque score in patients treated withrosuvastatin plus aspirin, or clopidogrel sulfate or ticagrelor (4 months, n =12) increased by 1.9%. TMA and TMAO in patients decreased by 38 and 29% in faeces(*P < 0.05; *P < 0.05), and 37 and 35% in plasma (***P < 0.001; *P < 0.05), after4 months on BBR. BBR might treat atherosclerotic plaque at least partiallythrough decreasing TMAO in a mode of action similar to that of vitamins.

TI  - Role of C3a as a Novel Regulator of 25(OH)D3 to 1alpha,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3Metabolism in Upper Airway Epithelial Cells.
PG  - 262-269
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2000726 [doi]
AB  - In patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, primary humansinonasal epithelial cell (HSNEC) 1alpha-hydroxylase levels are reduced, as istheir ability to metabolize 25-hydroxycholecalciferol [25(OH)D3] to its activemetabolite, 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3]. In this study, we soughtto identify the factor responsible for the regulation of HSNEC metabolism of25(OH)D3, focusing on C3 and C3a. Multiple inhaled irritants trigger the release of complement components, C3 and C3a, leading to suppression of1alpha-hydroxylase levels in HSNECs. Recombinant C3a was able to decrease1alpha-hydroxylase and impair 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 metabolism, while addition of a C3a receptor antagonist restored conversion. Conversely, 1,25(OH)2D3suppressed Aspergillus fumigatus-induced C3 and C3a levels in HSNEC supernatant. Given the ability of 1,25(OH)2D3 to modulate LL37 in other cell types, weexamined its regulation in HSNECs and relationship to C3a. 1,25(OH)2D3 stimulatedthe secretion of LL37, whereas A. fumigatus and C3a suppressed it. Conversely,LL37 reduced the release of C3/C3a by HSNECs. Lastly, oral steroid use and invitro dexamethasone application both failed to increase 1alpha-hydroxylase orreduce C3a levels. In summary, in this article, we describe for the first time a novel relationship between complement activation and local vitamin D metabolismin airway epithelial cells. The presence of elevated C3/C3a in patients withasthma and/or chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps may account for theirimpaired HSNEC 25(OH)D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3 metabolism and explain why they receivelimited therapeutic benefit from oral vitamin D3 supplementation.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268396 [doi]
AB  - To assess the evidence on SARS-CoV2 infection and Covid-19 in relation todeficiency and supplementation of vitamin D, we conducted a systematic review up to April 2021. We summarised data from 38 eligible studies, which presented risk estimates for at least one endpoint, including two RCT and 27 cohort-studies:205565 patients with information on 25OHD status and 2022 taking vitamin Dsupplementation with a total of 1197 admitted to the ICU or who needed invasivemechanical ventilation or intubation and hospital stay, and more than 910Covid-19 deaths. Primary outcomes were severity and mortality and the main aimwas to evaluate the association with vitamin D supplementation. Random effectsmodels showed that supplementation was associated with a significant lower riskof both Covid-19 severe disease (SRR 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.72, 6 studies) andmortality (SRR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17-0.70, 8 studies). There were no statisticallysignificant dose differences between studies: summary estimates with regulardoses remain statistically significant, suggesting that higher doses are notnecessary. For patients on vitamin D supplementation, a greater reduction inmortality risk emerged in older individuals and at higher latitudes. Regardingthe quality of studies, assessed using the New Castle-Ottawa quality scale, theanalysis revealed in most cases no statistically significant differences between low, medium or high quality studies. We found significant associations of vitaminD supplementation with Covid-19, encompassing risks of disease worsening andmortality, especially in seasons characterized by 25OHD deficiency and with notsevere patients. Dedicated randomized clinical studies are encouraged to confirm these results.

PG  - e0269585
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0269585 [doi]
AB  - The increase in the area cultivated with vitamin-enriched transgenic cropsproducing Bt toxin raises the question of whether the addition of vitamins willin any way mitigates the effect of the toxin on the phytophagous insects thatfeed on those crops. On the other hand, the parental effect that feeding on theseenriched transgenic crops may have on the offspring of the phytophagous thatsurvive on them is not well known. In this work, the effect of vitamin A(beta-carotene) addition to diets with or without Bt toxin on Helicoverpaarmigera larvae and their offspring was determined. The addition of vitamin A didnot have any beneficial effect either for the larvae fed on enriched diets norfor their offspring. However, parental effects due to dietary feeding with thetoxin were detected since adults from larvae fed on the Bt diet had higher matingsuccess than those fed on the toxin-free diet, although there were no differenceson the fertility of mated females regardless of whether their previous larvae fedon the Bt or non-Bt diet. A certain adaptive effect to the toxin was also notedsince the mortality of larvae whose previous generation fed on diet with Bt waslower than that of the larvae that came from larvae fed on a non-Bt diet. Itwould be interesting to determine if H. armigera adults prefer to mate and layeggs in the same type of crops in which they have developed or if feeding ondifferent crops, such as corn or alfalfa, causes different paternal effects onthe offspring. These aspects can be of great importance in the development ofresistance of this species to the Bt toxin.

AB  - Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), a complication of herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) infection causes neurological disorder or even death in immunocompromisedadults and newborns. However, the intrinsic factors controlling the HSE outcomeremain unclear. Here, we show that HSE mice exhibit gut microbiota dysbiosis and altered metabolite configuration and tryptophan-nicotinamide metabolism. HSV-1neurotropic infection activated microglia, with changed immune properties andcell numbers, to stimulate antiviral immune response and contribute substantiallyto HSE. In addition, depletion of gut microbiota by oral antibiotics(ABX)-treatment triggered the hyper-activation of microglia, which in turnenhanced inflammatory immune response, and cytokine production, resulting inaggregated viral burden and HSE pathology. Furthermore, exogenous administration of nicotinamide n-oxide (NAMO), an oxidative product of nicotinamide derived fromgut microbiota, to ABX-treated or untreated HSE mice significantly diminishedmicroglia-mediated proinflammatory response and limited HSV-1 infection in CNS.Mechanistic study revealed that HSV-1 activates microglia by increasingmitochondrial damage via defective mitophagy, whereas microbial metabolite NAMOrestores NAD+-dependent mitophagy to inhibit microglia activation and HSEprogression. NAMO also prevented neuronal cell death triggered by HSV-1 infectionor microglia-mediated microenvironmental toxicity. Finally, we show that NAMO is mainly generated by neomycin-sensitive bacteria, especially Lactobacillus_gasseriand Lactobacillus_reuteri. Together, these data demonstrate that gut microbialmetabolites act as intrinsic restrictive factors against HSE progression viaregulating mitophagy in microglia, implying further exploration of bacterial ornutritional approaches for treating neurotropic virus-related neurodegenerativediseases.

AB  - There is growing evidence of vitamin D involvement in immune regulation and gutbarrier function, suggesting that vitamin D may play a critical role in thedevelopment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This review presents advances inthe molecular mechanisms of vitamin D and vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling withrespect to barrier integrity and innate/adaptive immunity in the gut, as well as recent findings in uncovering the biological link between vitamin D-associatedgenetic variants and IBD. Experimental data have revealed a mechanistic basis forthe contribution of vitamin D to the pathogenesis of IBD. The vitamin D/VDRcomplex is involved in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses to pathogenic threats by acting as an immunomodulator and alleviating inflammationin experimental IBD models and IBD patients, contributing to intestinalhomeostasis. Vitamin D has been associated with the promotion of antimicrobialpeptide secretion, down-regulation of dendritic cell activity, induction oftolerogenic rather than pro-inflammatory T-cell differentiation and function, andincreased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, highlighting its potentialtherapeutic value for IBD. Elucidating the complex interplay between vitaminD/VDR and the pathogenesis of IBD is critical for the development of noveltherapeutic interventions and for the potential use of this molecule as aprognostic and diagnostic tool in clinical practice.

TI  - Dietary intake of one-carbon metabolism-related nutrients and hepatocellularcarcinoma survival in the Guangdong Liver Cancer Cohort.
PG  - 8081-8090
LID - 10.1039/d2fo00943a [doi]
AB  - Dietary intake of one-carbon metabolism-related nutrients has been linked tocancer-related outcomes, but their effects on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)mortality are still unknown. The objective was to assess whether pre-diagnosticdietary intakes of methionine, folate, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, riboflavin andniacin are associated with HCC survival in this prospective cohort study. Intotal, 905 newly diagnosed HCC patients were recruited in the Guangdong LiverCancer Cohort study between September 2013 and April 2017. Dietary intake wasassessed using a validated 79-item food frequency questionnaire. Cox proportionalhazard regression models were utilized to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) for the overall and HCC-specific mortality. During amedian of 791 days of follow-up, we documented 395 deaths, 353 (89%) of whichresulted from HCC. The multivariate-adjusted HRs in the highest vs. the lowestquartile of methionine intake were 0.59 (95% CI: 0.42-0.80; P for trend = 0.001) for overall mortality and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.49-0.93; P for trend = 0.027) forHCC-specific mortality. However, no significant association of othermicronutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism with HCC survival was observed. Our research suggests that a high level of methionine intake, but no otherone-carbon metabolism-related nutrients, may improve survival in patients withnewly diagnosed HCC.

TI  - Protective Effect of Organ Preservation Fluid Supplemented With Nicorandil andRutin Trihydrate: A Comparative Study in a Rat Model of Renal Ischemia.
PG  - 569-579
LID - 10.6002/ect.2022.0019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of organ preservation is sustained viability ofdetached/removed/isolated organs and subsequent successful posttransplantoutcomes. Nicorandil (an ATP-sensitive potassium channel opener) is anefficacious agent to preserve lungs and heart. Rutin trihydrate (an antioxidant) inhibits free radical-mediated cytotoxicity and lipid peroxidation. We aimed toevaluate the efficacy of nicorandil and rutin trihydrate to enhance kidneypreservation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prepared 2 versions of organ preservationfluid, supplemented with either nicorandil or rutin trihydrate, and used 3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assays to evaluate the efficacy of these solutions in vitro (HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells), according tovarious cellular parameters such as ATP levels, reactive oxygen species, and cellviability. We also investigated the in vivo preservation efficacy in a rat model of renal ischemia and evaluated the immunohistological expression of apoptoticmarkers (caspase 3) in preserved rat kidney. RESULTS: We observed significantimprovement of intracellular ATP levels (32 999 +/- 1454 pmol/cell, n = 3; P <.05) in cells preserved in the nicorandil- supplemented solution compared withCustodiol solution (23 216 +/- 1315 pmol/cell). Reactive oxygen species declined 1.25-fold (P < .05) in the presence of rutin trihydrate. Cell viability assaysrevealed a 4.8-fold increase in viability of renal cells preserved in thesolutions supplemented with nicorandil or rutin trihydrate after 24-hourincubation compared with controls. In vivo, there were significant effects onserum creatinine (0.5480 +/- 0.052, 0.956 +/- 0.043 mg/dL) and blood ureanitrogen (85.36 +/- 4.64, 92.85 +/- 3.15 mg/dL) with the nicorandil and rutintrihydrate solutions, respectively. We observed suppressed expression of theapoptotic marker caspase 3 in groups treated with the 2 supplemented preservationfluids. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that solutions of organ preservationfluid supplemented with either nicorandil or rutin trihydrate can amelioratecellular problems/dysfunction and facilitate sustained impro - vement of tissuesurvival and subsequent organ viability.

TI  - Neuroprotective effect of thiamine-producing lactic acid bacteria in a murineParkinsonian model.
PG  - 8056-8067
LID - 10.1039/d2fo01195f [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disordercharacterized by deterioration and loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantianigra pars compacta (SNpc), resulting in motor deficits. Many studies haverevealed an inverse relationship between thiamine consumption and susceptibility to PD. Previously, Lactiplantibacillus (L.) plantarum CRL 1905 was selected asthiamine-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and its amprolium-resistant clone,L. plantarum CRL 1905*, was able to produce higher levels of this vitamin andinhibited neuronal death in an in vitro model. The present work aimed to evaluatethe neuroprotective effect of these thiamine-producing LAB in an in vivoparkinsonian mouse model. Male C57BL/6 mice injected with1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) were orally administered withone of the LAB strains or commercial thiamine for 1 month. The administration of either thiamine-producing LAB prevented the motor deficits of mice similar to theeffects of the commercial vitamin. These benefits were associated with increased number of tyrosine hydroxylase positive (TH+) neurons in the SNpc. The evaluationof the inflammatory response caused by the neurotoxin showed that both LABdecreased pro-inflammatory cytokines in serum; moreover, the strain selected asthe higher thiamine producer showed the best anti-inflammatory effect locally in the brain and significantly decreased the levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, IFN-gammaand MCP-1, which remained similar to the levels of healthy control animals. Theseresults demonstrated that thiamine-producing L. plantatum CRL 1905* has thepotential to be used as part of a strategy to prevent or to complement thetreatments of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. A limitation of this studyis that we cannot guarantee whether LAB are capable of producing thiamine in the intestinal tract or release the vitamin after lysis; however, the results showthat thiamine production by L. plantarum CRL 1905 is implicated in the observedeffect, in addition to other benefits associated with the LAB strain that arealso involved and are currently under study.

AB  - Aquatic food products (AFPs) are primarily preferred by consumers due to theirhigh-quality protein content, omega 3 fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, and lowcalories. However, AFPs are easily degraded by microbial, enzymatic, and chemicalreactions. The cold storage, freezing, chemical preservation, salting as well as vacuum packaging systems are the major preservation techniques. However, they areinsufficient to extend the shelf life of AFPs. Therefore, researchers havefocused on the availability of nanotechnology to be used in AFPs in line with thechanging consumer demands. Studies on the effectiveness of nanoemulsion,nanoparticle, and nanofiber forms to increment the shelf life of AFPs are rapidlyincreasing. In this review, the degradation mechanisms of AFPs, thenano-preservation approaches, and possible mechanisms of action are reviewed withthe current knowledge. The article highlights that nano-preservation approachesin AFPs have better microbial and physicochemical parameters such as totalvolatile basic nitrogen (TVBN), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), peroxide value (PV),free fatty acid (FFA), pH as well as the shelf life extension compared to theconventional methods. The antimicrobial activity of nanostructures reduces themicrobial load of AFPs and delays the onset of oxidative degradation.Consequently, researchers suggest that nano-approaches may have great potentialin extending the shelf life of AFPs.

TI  - Beneficial effects of oral vitamin D supplementation in diabetes mellitus type IIpatients - a clinical study in Karachi.
PG  - 845-850
AB  - Vitamins are an essential component of the human body for growth and maintaining health. All vitamins have a significant role in metabolism, as a prophylactic in preventing various diseases, and maintaining health. Literature studies havepredicted the positive impact of vitamin D on sugar level in blood of type 2diabetes. Vitamin D plays a significant role in treating diabetes mellitusbecause it helps produce insulin and helps in the growth of beta cells of thepancreas. The present study was conducted for evaluating the impact of oralvitamin D in reducing the hyperglycemic conditions in patients after treatment of1-6 months duration. 52 type 2 diabetes patients were enrolled in the study. The results showed that Vitamin D supplementation of 16 weeks reduced fasting bloodglucose and HbA1C significantly in Vitamin D deficient Type 2 diabetes.

TI  - Biological properties and potential of compounds extracted from red seaweeds.
PG  - 1-32
LID - 10.1007/s11101-022-09826-z [doi]
AB  - Macroalgae have been recently used for different applications in the food,cosmetic and pharmaceutical industry since they do not compete for land andfreshwater against other resources. Moreover, they have been highlighted as apotential source of bioactive compounds. Red algae (Rhodophyta) are the largestgroup of seaweeds, including around 6000 different species, thus it can behypothesized that they are a potential source of bioactive compounds. Sulfatedpolysaccharides, mainly agar and carrageenans, are the most relevant andexploited compounds of red algae. Other potential molecules are essential fattyacids, phycobiliproteins, vitamins, minerals, and other secondary metabolites.All these compounds have been demonstrated to exert several biologicalactivities, among which antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, andantimicrobial properties can be highlighted. Nevertheless, these properties need to be further tested on in vivo experiments and go in-depth in the study of themechanism of action of the specific molecules and the understanding of thestructure-activity relation. At last, the extraction technologies are essentialfor the correct isolation of the molecules, in a cost-effective way, tofacilitate the scale-up of the processes and their further application by theindustry. This manuscript is aimed at describing the fundamental composition ofred algae and their most studied biological properties to pave the way to theutilization of this underused resource.

BTI - Shorter Versus Longer Durations of Exclusive Human Milk Feeding and Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A Systematic Review
LID - 10.52570/NESR.PB242018.SR0224 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This systematic review was conducted as part of the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to24 Months Project. The goal of this systematic review was to examine thefollowing question: What is the relationship between shorter versus longerdurations of exclusive human milk feeding and inflammatory bowel disease? Thissystematic review examines comparisons of infants who were fed human milkexclusively for shorter durations with infants who were fed human milkexclusively for longer durations. Exclusive human milk feeding was defined asfeeding human milk alone and not in combination with infant formula and/orcomplementary foods or beverages such as cow's milk. This definition is inclusiveof the World Health Organization definitions of exclusive and predominantbreastfeeding, which permit limited quantities of (a) drops or syrups containing vitamins, minerals, or medicines, (b) water and water-based drinks such assweetened water and teas, (c) fruit juice, (d) oral rehydration salts solution,and (e) ritual fluids. Human milk was defined as mother's own milk provided atthe breast (i.e., nursing) or expressed and fed fresh or after refrigeration orfreezing. Donor milk (e.g., banked milk) was not examined in this review. Thissystematic review examines diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease, only, to ensure that it addresses the relationship of shorter versus longer durations ofexclusive human milk feeding with inflammatory bowel disease and not therelationship of shorter versus longer durations of exclusive human milk feedingwith the many other diseases and conditions with similar symptoms. CONCLUSIONSTATEMENT AND GRADE: There is insufficient evidence to determine whether or notthere is a relationship between shorter versus longer durations of exclusivehuman milk feeding and inflammatory bowel disease in offspring. Grade: Grade Not Assignable. METHODS: The systematic review was conducted by a team of staff from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review in collaboration with a Technical ExpertCollaborative. A single literature search was conducted to identify literaturefor several related systematic reviews that examined infant milk-feedingpractices and different outcomes. The search was conducted in CINAHL, Cochrane,Embase, and PubMed, and used a search date range of January 1980 to March 2016. Amanual search was done to identify articles that may not have been included inthe electronic databases searched. Articles were screened independently by 2 NESRanalysts to determine which articles met predetermined criteria for inclusion.Data from the included article were extracted, risks of bias were assessed, andboth were checked for accuracy. A conclusion statement was developed, and thestrength of the evidence (grade) was assessed using pre-established criteriaincluding evaluation of the internal validity/risk of bias, adequacy,consistency, impact, and generalizability of available evidence. SUMMARY OFEVIDENCE: This review includes 2 articles, which provided insufficient evidenceto draw any conclusions about the relationship between the duration of exclusive human milk feeding and inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  - Co-implementing vitamin A supplementation with seasonal malaria chemopreventionin Sokoto State, Nigeria: a feasibility and acceptability study.
PG  - 871
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-08264-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bi-annual high dose vitamin A supplements administered to childrenaged 6-59 months can significantly reduce child mortality, but vitamin Asupplementation (VAS) coverage is low in Nigeria. The World Health Organizationrecommends that VAS be integrated into other public health programmes which areaimed at improving child survival. Seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC)provides a ready platform for VAS integration to improve health outcomes. Thisstudy explored the feasibility and acceptability of integrating VAS with SMC inone local government area in Sokoto State. METHODS: A concurrent QUAN-QUAL mixed methods study was used to assess the feasibility and acceptability ofco-implementing VAS with SMC in one LGA of Sokoto state. Existing SMCimplementation tools and job aids were revised and SMC and VAS were deliveredusing a door-to-door approach. VAS and SMC coverage were subsequently assessedusing questionnaires administered to 188 and 197 households at baseline andendline respectively. The qualitative component involved key informant interviewsand focus group discussions with policymakers, programme officials and technical partners to explore feasibility and acceptability. Thematic analysis was carried out on the qualitative data. RESULTS: At endline, the proportion of children who received at least one dose of VAS in the last six months increased significantly from 2 to 59% (p < 0.001). There were no adverse effects on the coverage of SMCdelivery with 70% eligible children reached at baseline, increasing to 76% (p =0.412) at endline. There was no significant change (p = 0.264) in the quality of SMC, measured by proportion of children receiving their first dose as directlyobserved treatment (DOT), at baseline (54%) compared to endline (68%). Thequalitative findings are presented as two overarching themes relating tofeasibility and acceptability of the integrated VAS-SMC strategy, and withineach, a series of sub-themes describe study participants' views of importantconsiderations in implementing the strategy. CONCLUSION: This study showed thatit is feasible and acceptable to integrate VAS with SMC delivery in areas of highseasonal malaria transmission such as northern Nigeria, where SMC campaigns areimplemented. SMC-VAS integrated campaigns can significantly increase vitamin Acoverage but more research is required to demonstrate the feasibility of thisintegration in different settings and on a larger scale.

TI  - Indigenous knowledge system associated with the uses of insects for therapeuticor medicinal purposes in two main provinces of Burkina Faso, West Africa.
PG  - 50
LID - 10.1186/s13002-022-00547-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Some insects are harmful to humans, plants and animals, but some ofthem can also be a source of proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals and be oftherapeutic value. The therapeutic potential requires that medicinal insects and their derived products need to be scrutinized. This study highlights theindigenous knowledge related to their use of medicinal insects in peri-urban and urban areas of Burkina Faso. METHODS: The survey was carried out among 60traditional healers spread across two phytogeographical zones of Burkina Faso.The questionnaire focused on medicinal insects used by experienced traditionalhealers. Chi-square tests and principal component analysis were performed to testfor significant differences regarding knowledge of how insects inphytogeographically different areas were used therapeutically in connection with different disease categories. RESULTS: A total of 19 species of medicinal insectsbelonging to 6 orders were cited in connection with treatments of at least 78pathologies and symptoms. Most frequently mentioned was gastroenteritis. Ourstudy showed that 48.78% of the insects and their products were associated with46 plant species for the treatment of pathologies. In addition, honey, beeswaxand nests were the most widely insect products used. CONCLUSION: The currentstudy allows us to identify medicinal insects as well as their products used inthe treatment of pathologies and symptoms, suggesting the presence of aconsiderable diversity of therapeutically important insect species. These insectsare used alone and/or with their products but often in association with medicinalplants. The results constitute a useful database for future studies of medicinal insects in central and western parts of Burkina Faso.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the diagnostic value of accessible fingertip meancorpuscular volume (MCV) combined with a visible "beefy red" patch in thediagnosis of vitamin B12 (VB12) deficiency in local clinics and hospitals withoutin-house clinical laboratories, especially in remote areas. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: The medical history data of patients complaining of oral mucosal pain atthe Stomatological Hospital of Southern Medical University were reviewed. Allincluded patients underwent fingertip blood routine examination, specificserological test (serum VB12, folic acid, iron, and ferritin), and detailed oral clinical examinations. According to the results of the serum VB12 test patientswere divided into case and control groups. In diagnostic test, the diagnosticvalue of the "beefy red" patch and elevated MCV in VB12 deficiency was evaluated by the receiver operator characteristic curve. RESULTS: There were more femalepatients than male patients in the case group (serum VB12 level < 148 pmol/L, n =81) and control group (serum VB12 level >/= 148 pmol/L, n = 60), mostlymiddle-aged and elderly patients. There were no statistical differences in genderand age between the two groups. In the case group, the number of individuals withstomach disease was 13, the number of individuals with "beefy red" patch was 78, the number of individuals with oral ulcer was 29, the number of individuals with "MCV > 100fL" and "folic acid < 15.9 nmol/L" were respectively 68 and 5. All weremore than that in control group (P < 0.05). The diagnostic test, "beefy redpatch" has high sensitivity (0.963) but low specificity(0.883), "MCV > 100 fL"has high specificity (0.933) but low specificity (0.815), and "MCV > 100 fLcombined with beefy red patch" has maximal specificity (0.950), and area underthe curve (0.949). CONCLUSIONS: Visible oral "beefy red" patch combined withaccessible fingertip blood MCV could improve the rate of diagnosis in VB12deficiency, especially in the elderly in local clinics and hospitals withoutin-house clinical laboratories in China, which is conducive to early diseasedetection and treatment.

TI  - Preconception vitamin D intake and obstetric outcomes in women using assistedreproductive technology: the Japan Environment and Children's Study.
PG  - 542
LID - 10.1186/s12884-022-04861-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In reproductive medicine, vitamin D (VitD) is of particular interest because its deficiency has been linked to various infertility issues. Thus,preconception care, including appropriate VitD supplementation, is essential,especially in women using assisted reproductive technology (ART). Despite thetherapeutic benefits of VitD, adverse events due to a high daily intake mayinfluence obstetric outcomes. However, the effects of either low or highpreconception VitD intake on obstetric outcomes, including the outcomes in women who used ART, remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine theassociation between pre-pregnancy daily VitD intake and obstetric outcomes inJapanese women, including those who conceived through ART. METHODS: Data wereobtained from the Japan Environment and Children's study database comprising92,571 women recruited between January 2011 and March 2014 in Japan. Participantswere categorized into five quintiles according to pre-pregnancy VitD intake (Q1and Q5 had the lowest and highest VitD intake, respectively) and stratifiedaccording to the use of ART. Multiple logistic regression was performed toidentify the effects of pre-pregnancy VitD intake on preterm birth (PTB),low-birth weight infant (LBW), and small for gestational age (SGA). RESULTS:Using Q3 (middle VitD intake) as a reference, our analysis revealed that Q5(highest VitD intake) showed an increased risk of LBW < 1500 g (adjusted oddsratio [aOR]: 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.00-1.18) and SGA (aOR: 1.26,95% CI: 1.14-1.39) among women who conceived without ART. Among women whoconceived with ART, we found that Q5 (highest VitD intake) showed an increasedrisk of PTB at < 37 weeks (aOR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.27-3.31). CONCLUSION: The presentstudy revealed that higher VitD intake before pregnancy may affect perinataloutcomes, particularly in women using ART. Our findings may facilitatepersonalized preconceptional counseling regarding VitD intake based on the methodof conception, especially among women using ART.

AB  - Most studies on osteoarthritis (OA) and vitamin D status were performed in Whiteswith relatively adequate vitamin D status. Associations may differ by baseline25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and race. We assessed the odds of OA and joint painaccording to vitamin D status in Korean adults >/= 50 years of age in thenationally representative Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 8575). Agreement between radiologic OA (ROA) and self-reported OA were also assessed. Multivariate logistic regression was performed and participants werestratified by sex. Adults with serum 25(OH)D < 12 ng/mL and 12 to < 20 ng/mL had 26% and 18% lower odds of knee ROA, respectively, compared to those with 25(OH)D >/= 20 ng/mL. Similar results were observed in men, but not women. Noassociations were found between 25(OH)D and knee ROA severity, lumbar spine ROA, symptomatic OA, or knee pain. Sensitivity of self-reported OA was low (27%),indicating a weak possibility of reverse causation. Prospective studies arerequired to identify the possible causality of vitamin D on OA in Korean men.

AB  - Antipsychotic-induced hyperprolactinemia (AP-induced HPRL) occurs overall in upto 70% of patients with schizophrenia, which is associated with hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction. We summarized the latest evidence for the benefits ofprolactin-lowering drugs. We performed network meta-analyses to summarize theevidence and applied Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, andEvaluation frameworks (GRADE) to rate the certainty of evidence, categorizeinterventions, and present the findings. The search identified 3,022 citations,31 studies of which with 1999 participants were included in networkmeta-analysis. All options were not significantly better than placebo amongpatients with prolactin (PRL) less than 50 ng/ml. However, adjunctivearipiprazole (ARI) (5 mg: MD = -64.26, 95% CI = -87.00 to -41.37; 10 mg: MD =-59.81, 95% CI = -90.10 to -29.76; more than 10 mg: MD = -68.01, 95% CI = -97.12 to -39.72), switching to ARI in titration (MD = -74.80, 95% CI = -134.22 to-15.99) and adjunctive vitamin B6 (MD = -91.84, 95% CI = -165.31 to -17.74) were associated with significant decrease in AP-induced PRL among patients with PRLmore than 50 ng/ml with moderated (adjunctive vitamin B6) to high (adjunctiveARI) certainty of evidence. Pharmacological treatment strategies for AP-inducedHPRL depends on initial PRL level. No effective strategy was found for patientswith AP-induced HPRL less than 50 ng/ml, while adjunctive ARI, switching to ARIin titration and adjunctive high-dose vitamin B6 showed better PRL decreaseeffect on AP-induced HPRL more than 50 ng/ml.

AB  - Change in cell size may bring in profound impact to cell function and survival,hence the integrity of the organs consisting of those cells. Nevertheless, howcell size is regulated remains incompletely understood. We used the fluorescentzebrafish transgenic line Tg-GGH/LR that displays inducible folate deficiency(FD) and hepatomegaly upon FD induction as in vivo model. We found that FD causedhepatocytes enlargement and increased liver stiffness, which could not beprevented by nucleotides supplementations. Both in vitro and in vivo studiesindicated that RIPK3/MLKL-dependent necroptotic pathway and Hippo signalinginteractively participated in this FD-induced hepatocytic enlargement in a dualchronological and cooperative manner. FD also induced hepatic inflammation, whichconvenes a dialog of positive feedback loop between necroptotic and Hippopathways. The increased MMP13 expression in response to FD elevated TNFalphalevel and further aggravated the hepatocyte enlargement. Meanwhile, F-actin wascircumferentially re-allocated at the edge under cell membrane in response to FD.Our results substantiate the interplay among intracellular folate status,pathways regulation, inflammatory responses, actin cytoskeleton and cell volumecontrol, which can be best observed with in vivo platform. Our data also support the use of this Tg-GGH/LR transgenic line for the mechanistical and therapeuticresearch for the pathologic conditions related to cell size alteration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the mechanism by which inositol-requiring enzyme-1alpha(IRE1alpha) regulates autophagy function of chondrocytes through calciumhomeostasis endoplasmic reticulum protein (CHERP). METHODS: Cultured humanchondrocytes (C28/I2 cells) were treated with tunicamycin, 4mu8c, rapamycin, orboth 4mu8c and rapamycin, and the expressions of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)stress- and autophagy-related proteins were detected with Western blotting.Primary chondrocytes from ERN1 knockout (ERN1 CKO) mice and wild-type mice wereexamined for ATG5 and ATG7 mRNA expressions, IRE1alpha and p-IRE1alpha proteinexpressions, and intracellular calcium ion content using qPCR, Western blottingand flow cytometry. The effect of bafilomycin A1 treatment on LC3 /LC3 ratio inthe isolated chondrocytes was assessed with Western blotting. Changes inautophagic flux of the chondrocytes in response to rapamycin treatment weredetected using autophagy dual fluorescent virus. The changes in autophagy levelin C28/I2 cells overexpressing CHERP and IRE1alpha were detected usingimmunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: Tunicamycin treatment significantlyup-regulated ER stress-related proteins and LC3 /LC3 ratio and down-regulated theexpression of p62 in C28/I2 cells (P < 0.05). Rapamycin obviously up-regulatedLC3 /LC3 ratio (P < 0.001) in C28/I2 cells, but this effect was significantlyattenuated by co-treatment with 4mu8c (P < 0.05). Compared with the cells fromthe wild-type mice, the primary chondrocytes from ERN1 knockout mice showedsignificantly down-regulated mRNA levels of ERN1 (P < 0.01), ATG5 (P < 0.001) andATG7 (P < 0.001), lowered or even lost expressions of IRE1alpha and p-IRE1alphaproteins (PP < 0.01), and increased expression of CHERP (P < 0.05) andintracellular calcium ion content (P < 0.001). Bafilomycin A1 treatment obviouslyincreased LC3 / LC3 ratio in the chondrocytes from both wild-type and ERN1knockout mice (P < 0.01 or 0.05), but the increment was more obvious in thewild-type chondrocytes (P < 0.05). Treatment with autophagy dual-fluorescencevirus resulted in a significantly greater fluorescence intensity of LC3-GFP inrapamycin-treated ERN1 CKO chondrocytes than in wild-type chondrocytes (P <0.05). In C28/I2 cells, overexpression of CHERP obviously decreased thefluorescence intensity of LC3, and overexpression of IRE1alpha enhanced thefluorescence intensity and partially rescued the fluorescence reduction of LC3caused by CHERP. CONCLUSION: IRE1alpha deficiency impairs autophagy inchondrocytes by upregulating CHERP and increasing intracellular calcium ioncontent.

TI  - Is RsfS a Hibernation Factor or a Ribosome Biogenesis Factor?
PG  - 500-510
LID - 10.1134/S0006297922060025 [doi]
AB  - Solving the structures of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic ribosomes bycrystallography and cryo-electron microscopy has given an impetus for studyingintracellular regulatory proteins affecting various stages of proteintranslation. Among them are ribosome hibernation factors, which have beenactively investigated during the last decade. These factors are involved in theregulation of protein biosynthesis under stressful conditions. The main role ofhibernation factors is the reduction of energy consumption for proteinbiosynthesis and preservation of existing functional ribosomes from degradation, which increases cell survival under unfavorable conditions. Despite a broadinterest in this topic, only a few articles have been published on the ribosomal silencing factor S (RsfS). According to the results of these studies, RsfS can beassigned to the group of hibernation factors. However, recent structural studies of the 50S ribosomal subunit maturation demonstrated that RsfS has the featuresinherent to biogenesis factors for example, ability to bind to the immatureribosomal subunit (similar to the RsfS mitochondrial ortholog MALSU1,mitochondrial assembly of ribosomal large subunit 1). In this review, wesummarized the information on the function and structural features RsfS, as well as compared RsfS with MALSU1 in order to answer the emerging question on whether RsfS is a hibernation factor or a ribosome biogenesis factor. We believe thatthis review might promote future studies of the RsfS-involving molecularmechanisms, which so far remain completely unknown.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been associated with increased risks of atheroscleroticcardiovascular disease, and poor glycemic control and oxidative stress play amajor role in its pathology. There is a lack of data on the role of dietaryantioxidant micronutrients, including vitamins and trace elements, in glycemiccontrol in T1D. The aim of this study is to examine associations of dietaryintakes of micronutrients with glycemic status. We report data from across-sectional analysis from the coronary artery calcification in type 1diabetes (CACTI) study (n = 1257; T1D: n = 568; nondiabetic controls: n = 689)collected between the years 2000 and 2002. Participants completed a validatedfood frequency questionnaire, a physical examination, and biochemical analyses.Linear regression was used to examine the associations of dietary antioxidantmicronutrients with HbA1c and estimated insulin sensitivity (eIS) in modelsadjusted for relevant covariates and stratified by diabetes status. In adultswith T1D, we observed higher dietary manganese intake associated with higher eIS in the model adjusted for age, sex, diabetes duration, and total calories. Innondiabetic controls, higher intake of manganese associated with lower HbA1c and higher eIS values that persisted in models adjusted for all relevant covariates. On the other hand, dietary copper revealed a positive association with HbA1c inmodels adjusted for all covariates, except BMI and plasma lipids. No associationswere noted for vitamins C and E and dietary carotenoids in either group. Thesefindings reveal dietary antioxidant micronutrients, especially trace elementssuch as copper and manganese deserve special attention in glycemic control inadults with T1D as well as in nondiabetic controls.This trial is register withNCT00005754.

LID - 10.1007/s00592-022-01923-x [doi]
AB  - AIMS: To see the effects of obesity on risk fracture, bone density (BMD), andvitamin D levels in a group of postmenopausal women, and consider how comorbidtype 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) modifies them. METHODS: 679 postmenopausal women were grouped into obese and non-obese. Obese women were grouped into those withT2DM and those without. 25(OH)-vitamin D, PTH and BMD were measured, andprevalent fragility fractures were gathered. RESULTS: Obese women had higherprevalence of T2DM, than non-obese women. Levels of 25(OH)-vitamin D were lowerand those of PTH higher in obese women, BMD values were higher in obese women.Diabetic-obese women had a higher prevalence of non-vertebral fractures thannon-diabetic-obese. Multivariate logistic regression model showed association of fragility fractures with age, total hip BMD, BMI and T2DM. Obese women havehigher BMD and lower 25(OH)-vitamin D values (and higher PTH) than non-obese,without diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: T2DM confers an increased risk of non-vertebralfractures in postmenopausal obese women.

TI  - Vitamin K3 inhibits FtsZ assembly, disrupts the Z-ring in Streptococcuspneumoniae and displays anti-pneumococcal activity.
PG  - 1543-1558
LID - 10.1042/BCJ20220077 [doi]
AB  - The respiratory pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae has acquired multiple-drugresistance over the years. An attractive strategy to combat pneumococcalinfection is to target cell division to inhibit the proliferation of S.pneumoniae. This work presents Vitamin K3 as a potential anti-pneumococcal drugthat targets FtsZ, the master coordinator of bacterial cell division. Vitamin K3 strongly inhibited S. pneumoniae proliferation with a minimum inhibitoryconcentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of 6 mug/ml.Vitamin K3 disrupted the Z-ring localization in both S. pneumoniae and Bacillussubtilis within 30 min of treatment, while the membrane integrity and nucleoidsegregation remain unchanged. Several complementary experiments showed thatVitamin K3 inhibits the assembly of purified S. pneumoniae FtsZ (SpnFtsZ) andinduces conformational changes in the protein. Interestingly, Vitamin K3interfered with GTP binding onto FtsZ and increased the GTPase activity of FtsZpolymers. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of SpnFtsZ revealed that Vitamin K3 delays the nucleation of FtsZ polymers and reduces the rate of polymerization.In the presence of a non-hydrolyzable analog of GTP, Vitamin K3 did not showinhibition of FtsZ polymerization. These results indicated that Vitamin K3induces conformational changes in FtsZ that increase GTP hydrolysis and thereby, destabilize the FtsZ polymers. Together, our data provide evidence that VitaminK3 derives its potent anti-pneumococcal activity by inhibiting FtsZ assembly.

AB  - Proximity-dependent biotinylation (PDB) combined with mass spectrometry analysis has established itself as a key technology to study protein-protein interactions in living cells. A widespread approach, BioID, uses an abortive variant of the E.coli BirA biotin protein ligase, a quite bulky enzyme with slow labelingkinetics. To improve PDB versatility and speed, various enzymes have beendeveloped by different approaches. Here we present a small-size engineeredenzyme: ultraID. We show its practical use to probe the interactome ofArgonaute-2 after a 10 min labeling pulse and expression at physiological levels.Moreover, using ultraID, we provide a membrane-associated interactome ofcoatomer, the coat protein complex of COPI vesicles. To date, ultraID is thesmallest and most efficient biotin ligase available for PDB and offers thepossibility of investigating interactomes at a high temporal resolution.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the current corticosteroid use and bone healthmanagement status of patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) in SouthKorea. This is a national population-based study utilized information from thedatabased of Korean National Health Insurance Database. Database regarding bonestatus, spine radiography findings, bone mineral density, and laboratory testresults were obtained, as well as the proportion of patients with spine and lowerlimb prostheses, occurrence of scoliosis, and age at scoliosis surgery.Deflazacort dose in the ambulant group (aged < 15 years) increased by age andyear. The maintenance dose of prednisolone and deflazacort for the 15-19 yearsgroup decreased by year. Among the patients, 12.47% underwent spine radiography, 23.11% underwent dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and 22.7% underwent vitamin D tests. Moreover, 40.9% of the patients were prescribed vitamin D at a mean age of14.6 +/- 6.1 years, while 10.22% were prescribed bisphosphonate at 17.92 +/- 3.4 years. Further, 16.1% of the patients underwent posterior spinal instrumentation and fusion at 14.4 +/- 2.3 years and 5.3% underwent anterior spinalinstrumentation and fusion at 14.4 +/- 2.3 years. Ankle-foot orthosis and spineorthosis prescriptions were noted in 4.91% and 1.84% of patients, respectively.In this our study, the current corticosteroid use and bone health managementstatus of DMD in South Korea has been presented. The dose prescription forcorticosteroid and bone health monitoring did not reach to currentrecommendation.

LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053479 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the pattern of substandard and falsified pharmaceuticalproducts recall in Nepal. SETTING: We analysed drug recall notices issued by the Department of Drug Administration (DDA), Nepal, and systematically reviewedpeer-reviewed research articles during January 2010 to December 2020.PARTICIPANTS: This study did not include human participants. However, data werecollected from 72 drug recall notices issued by DDA and four research papers.RESULTS: A total of 346 pharmaceutical products were recalled during the reportedperiod. The number of recalled pharmaceutical products has increasedsignificantly over the past decade in Nepal. The most frequently recalled drugswere antimicrobials followed by gastrointestinal medicines, vitamins andsupplements and pain and palliative medicines among others. Number of importedrecalled drugs were slightly higher (42.2%) than domestic recalled drugs (40.7%).Sixty-two percentage of recalled drugs were substandard, 11% were falsified andremaining 27% were not registered at the DDA. Similarly, higher number of modern drugs (62%) were recalled than traditional ones (35%). Hand sanitisers used tominimise COVID-19 transmission contributed significantly to the list of recalled pharmaceutical products in 2020. Most of these sanitisers contained significantamounts of methanol (as high as 75% v/v) instead of appropriate amount of ethylor isopropyl alcohol. The peer-reviewed research papers reported issues withlabelling, unregistered drugs and drugs failed in several laboratory testing.CONCLUSION: Our analysis showed that number of recalls of substandard andfalsified drugs are increasing in Nepal. Since the recall data in this paper did not include number of samples tested and location of samples collected, morestudies to understand the prevalence of substandard and falsified drugs in Nepal is recommended.

TI  - Effect of folic acid supplementation on diminished ovarian reserve: studyprotocol of a single-centre, open-label, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
PG  - e057689
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-057689 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), a commongynaecological disorder, is approximately 10% across the world. Failure in early diagnosis and treatment may result in continuous decreases in ovarian functionand the resultant loss in an opportunity of pregnancy, which greatly affects the happiness of the women's family and women's physical and mental health.Nevertheless, there has been no effective treatment for such a disorder untilnow. Folic acid, a member of the vitamin B family, is involved in one-carboncycle and methylation regulation. It has been found that folic acid affects thewhole period of pregnancy, and folic acid supplementation has shown effective to remarkably reduce the incidence of fetal neural tube defects and decrease plasma homocysteic acid levels, thereby resulting in a decline in the incidence ofabortion. In addition, folic acid is reported to mediate ovarian functions. It istherefore hypothesised that folic acid may improve DOR. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Asingle-centre, open-label, randomised, placebo-controlled clinical trial isdesigned. We plan to recruit 140 women with DOR at ages of 30-35 years. Allparticipants will be randomised into the folic acid group and placebo group, and each subject will be given a tablet with the same appearance daily for 6 months. The primary outcome is antral follicle count, and the secondary outcomes areovarian reserve markers, ovarian low-dose stimulation responses and safety.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Ethics Review Committee of Nanping First Hospital Affiliated to Fujian Medical University on 10 February 2021 (approval number: NPSY202002042). Written informed consent was obtained fromall participants prior to randomisation, following a detailed description of the purpose of the study. The results of this clinical trial will be presented atscientific conferences and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. TRIALREGISTRATION NUMBER: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR2100047410.

TI  - Iron-overloaded follicular fluid increases the risk of endometriosis-relatedinfertility by triggering granulosa cell ferroptosis and oocyte dysmaturity.

AB  - Endometriosis (EMs) occurs in approximately 50% of women with infertility. Themain causes of EMs-related infertility are follicle dysplasia and reduced oocyte quality. Iron overload occurs in ovarian follicular fluid (FF) of patients withEMs, and this condition is associated with oocyte maturation disorder. However,the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. In the present study,we identified the mechanism underlying ferroptosis in ovarian granulosa cells andoocyte maturation failure in EMs based on a retrospective review of in vitrofertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection-frozen embryo transfer outcomes ininfertile patients with EMs. Mouse granulosa cells were treated with EMs-related infertile patients' follicular fluid (EMFF) in vitro. Western blot analysis,quantitative polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence staining, and transmissionelectron microscopy were used to assess granulosa cells ferroptosis. The effects of exosomes were examined by nanoparticle tracking analysis, RNA-seq, and Westernblot analysis. Finally, the therapeutic values of vitamin E and iron chelator(deferoxamine mesylate) in vivo were evaluated in an EMs-related infertilitymodel. Patients with ovarian EMs experienced poorer oocyte fertility thanpatients with non-ovarian EMs. We observed that EMFF with iron overload-inducedgranulosa cell ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, nuclear receptorcoactivator four-dependent ferritinophagy was involved in this process. Notably, granulosa cells undergoing ferroptosis further suppressed oocyte maturation byreleasing exosomes from granulosa cells. In therapeutic studies, vitamin E andiron chelators effectively alleviated EMs-related infertility models. Our studyindicates a novel mechanism through which EMFF with iron overload inducesferroptosis of granulosa cells and oocyte dysmaturity in EMs-related infertility,providing a potential therapeutic strategy for EMs-related infertility.

AB  - A kidney transplant recipient with a medical history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) presents to the clinic with an acute kidney injury (AKI) and diarrhoea.Kidney biopsy found deposition of focal oxalate crystals, and furtherinvestigation revealed a raised 24-hour urinary oxalate and reduced faecalelastase. Therefore, we present a case of acute oxalate nephropathy (AON)secondary to enteric hyperoxaluria as a result of pancreatic insufficiency causedby T1DM. T1DM is a common cause of end-stage renal failure and exocrinepancreatic insufficiency. Therefore, AON secondary to enteric hyperoxaluriashould be considered in patients with a transplant AKI. Earlier testing of24-hour urinary oxalate and faecal elastase could generate diagnosis beforebiopsy results and allow commencement of pancreatic replacement therapy earlierto avoid permanent loss of kidney function.

AB  - Biotin (B8), folate (B9), and vitamin B12 (B12) are involved in several metabolicreactions related to energy metabolism. We hypothesized that a low supply of one of these vitamins during the transition period would impair metabolic status.This study was undertaken to assess the interaction between B8 supplement and asupplementation of B9 and B12 regarding body weight (BW) change, dry matterintake, energy balance, and fatty acid (FA) compositions of colostrum and milkfat from d -21 to 21 relative to calving. Thirty-two multiparous Holstein cowshoused in tie stalls were randomly assigned, according to their previous 305-dmilk yield, to 8 incomplete blocks in 4 treatments: (1) a 2-mL weekly i.m.injection of saline (0.9% NaCl; B8-/B9B12-); (2) 20 mg/d of dietary B8(unprotected from ruminal degradation) and 2-mL weekly i.m. injection of 0.9%NaCl (B8+/B9B12-); (3) 2.6 g/d of dietary B9 (unprotected) and 2-mL weekly i.m.injection of 10 mg of B12 (B8-/B9B12+); (4) 20 mg/d of dietary B8, 2.6 g/d ofdietary B9, and 2-mL weekly i.m. injection of 10 mg of B12 (B8+/B9B12+) in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement. Colostrum was sampled at first milking. and milk sampleswere collected weekly on 2 consecutive milkings and analyzed for FA composition. Body condition score and BW were recorded every week throughout the trial. Withinthe first 21 d of lactation, B8-/B9B12+ cows had an increased milk yield by 13.5%[45.5 (standard error, SE: 1.8) kg/d] compared with B8-/B9B12- cows [40.1 (SE:1.9)], whereas B8 supplement had no effect. Even though body condition score was not affected by treatment, B8-/B9B12+ cows had greater BW loss by 24 kg,suggesting higher mobilization of body reserves. Accordingly, milk de novo FAdecreased and preformed FA concentration increased in B8-/B9B12+ cows comparedwith B8-/B9B12- cows. In addition, cows in the B8+/B9B12- group had decreasedmilk de novo FA and increased preformed FA concentration compared with B8-/B9B12-cows. Treatment had no effect on colostrum preformed FA concentration.Supplemental B8 decreased concentrations of ruminal biohydrogenationintermediates and odd- and branched-chain FA in colostrum and milk fat. Moreover,postpartum dry matter intake for B8+ cows tended to be lower by 1.6 kg/d. Theseresults could indicate ruminal perturbation caused by the B8 supplement, whichwas not protected from rumen degradation. Under the conditions of the currentstudy, in contrast to B8+/B9B12- cows, B8-/B9B12+ cows produced more milk withoutincreasing dry matter intake, although these cows had greater body fatmobilization in early lactation as suggested by the FA profile and BW loss.

TI  - Assessment of the relationship between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and albuminuria intype 2 diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 171
LID - 10.1186/s12902-022-01088-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy occurs in about one-third of diabetic patients. This health problem is characterized by increased urinary albumin excretion,leading to decreased glomerular filtration rate and renal failure. In thisregard, previous investigations have revealed the possibility of a relationshipbetween vitamin D deficiency and diabetic nephropathy. The present study assessedthe relationship between vitamin D deficiency and albuminuria in patients withtype 2 diabetes. METHODS: This study was conducted with 200 participants withtype 2 diabetes mellitus from December 2019 to January 2021. The patients'25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) serum level and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio(UACR) were measured concurrently. Afterward, the subjects were divided intothree groups based on their albuminuria level. Finally, 25OHD serum level andother clinical characteristics were compared among these albuminuria groups, and the relation between albuminuria level and 25OHD was analyzed. RESULTS: Theprevalence of vitamin D deficiency in macroalbuminuric patients (UACR>/=300 mg/g)was 61.8%, and in microalbuminuric (30 </= UACR< 300 mg/g) and normoalbuminuricgroups (UACR< 30 mg/g) was 33.3% and 24%, respectively. Further analysis revealeda significant negative relationship between 25OHD and albuminuria(r = - 0.257,p-value< 0.001). According to ROC curve analysis, a 25OHD level </= 21 ng/ml was considered an optimal cut-off point value for having macroalbuminuria in diabeticpatients. CONCLUSIONS: The current study evaluates the relation between vitamin Ddeficiency and the prevalence of albuminuria in the setting of diabetes. Overall,the prevalence of macroalbuminuria increased when the 25OHD serum level was less than 20 ng/ml.

AB  - CONTEXT: The litchi semen are traditional medications for treating liver fibrosis(LF) in China. The mechanism remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the anti-liver fibrotic mechanism of the total flavonoids of litchi semen (TFL). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced LFwere treated with TFL (50 and 100 mg/kg) for 4 weeks. The anti-liver fibroticeffects of TFL were evaluated and the underlying mechanisms were investigated viahistopathological analysis, proteomic analysis and molecular biology technology. RESULTS: Significant anti-LF effects were observed in the high-TFL-dose group(TFL-H, p < 0.05). Five hundred and eighty-five and 95 differentially expressedproteins (DEPs) were identified in the LF rat model (M group) and TFL-H group,respectively. The DEPs were significantly enriched in the retinol metabolismpathway (p < 0.0001). The content of 9-cis-retinoic acid (0.93 +/- 0.13 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.10, p < 0.05, vs. the M group) increased significantly in the TFL-H group. The upregulation of RXRalpha (0.50 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.27 +/- 0.13 protein, p < 0.05),ALDH2 (1.24 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.08 protein, p < 0.05), MMP3 (0.89 +/- 0.02vs. 0.61 +/- 0.12 protein, p < 0.05), Aldh1a7 (0.20 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.03 +/- 0.00mRNA, p < 0.05) and Aox3 (0.72 +/- 0.14 vs. 0.05 +/- 0.01 mRNA, p < 0.05) afterTFL treatment was verified. CONCLUSIONS: TFL exhibited good anti-liver fibroticeffects, which may be related to the upregulation of the retinol metabolismpathway. TFL may be promising anti-LF agents with potential clinical application prospects.

TI  - Network pharmacology prediction and molecular docking-based strategy to explorethe pharmacodynamic substances and mechanism of "Mung Bean" against bacterialinfection.
PG  - 58-68
LID - 10.1080/03639045.2022.2094399 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The network pharmacology approach combined the technologies ofmolecular docking and in vitro bacteriostatic validation to explore the activecompounds, core targets, and mechanism of Mung Bean against bacterial infection. METHODS: A Mung Bean target and anti-bacterial infection-related gene set wasestablished using TCMSP and GeneCards databases. Gene ontology (GO), KyotoEncyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction network were performed using DAVID and STRING database. Thecombination of core targets and active compounds was predicted by moleculardocking. The bacteriostatic experiment in vitro was performed to verify theantibacterial activity of the active compounds. RESULT: 32 potential targets and 5 active compounds of Mung Bean against bacterial infection were obtained bybioinformatics analysis. SRC, EGFR, and MAPK8 might be the candidate targets ofMung Bean. There were 137 GO items (p < 0.05) and 60 signaling pathways (p <0.05) in GO and KEGG enrichment analysis. The PI3K-AKT pathway, TNF signalingpathway, MAPK signaling pathway might play a significant role in Mung Beanagainst bacterial infection. Molecular docking results showed that sitosterol andvitamin-e had a high binding affinity with the core targets, which might be thekey compounds of Mung bean. In vitro bacteriostatic experimental verified thatvitamin-e had a significant bacteriostatic effect. CONCLUSION: Sitosterol andvitamin-E in Mung bean might act on MAPK1, regulate inflammation and immuneresponse to play a role in anti-bacterial infection.

AB  - Ultraviolet radiation affects human health. On the one hand, moderate amounts of UV radiation can promote human health and have the effect of promoting vitamin D production; but on the other hand, excessive UV radiation can also cause adverse effects on human skin and eyes, such as causing skin photoaging, skin cancer,electrophthalmia and cataracts to occur. Therefore, the measurement ofultraviolet radiation is extremely important. This paper mainly reviews thehealth effects of ultraviolet radiation and the progress of measurement standardsin the workplace, and puts forward suggestions on the revision of the existingstandards from five aspects including use new measuring instruments and methods, improve the existing measuring instruments, specify the number of measurements,expand the scope of application of the standards and consider the influence ofthe sun on the measurement of artificial ultraviolet radiation, so as to provide reference for the revision of new standards.

TI  - Add-On Effect of Selenium and Vitamin D Combined Supplementation in Early Controlof Graves' Disease Hyperthyroidism During Methimazole Treatment.
PG  - 886451
LID - 10.3389/fendo.2022.886451 [doi]
AB  - Prompt and stable control of hyperthyroidism is fundamental to avoid thedetrimental effects of thyroid hormone excess, and antithyroid drugs, mainlymethimazole (MMI), represent the first-line treatment for Graves' disease (GD)hyperthyroidism. Decreased serum concentrations of selenium (Se) and calcifediol (25(OH)D, VitD) have been reported in newly diagnosed GD patients inobservational studies. Low Se levels might exacerbate oxidative stress bycompromising the antioxidant machinery's response to reactive oxygen species, andlow VitD levels might hamper the anti-inflammatory immune response. We performed a randomized controlled clinical trial (EudraCT 2017-00505011) to investigatewhether Se and cholecalciferol (VitD) addition to MMI is associated with aprompter control of hyperthyroidism. Forty-two consecutive patients withnewly-onset GD and marginal/insufficient Se and VitD levels were randomlyassigned to treatment with either MMI monotherapy or MMI combined with Se andVitD. Se treatment was withdrawn after 180 days, while the other treatments were continued. Combination therapy resulted in a significantly greater reduction inserum FT4 concentration at 45 days (-37.9 pg/ml, CI 95%, -43.7 to -32.2 pg/ml)and 180 days (-36.5 pg/ml, CI 95%, -42 to -30.9 pg/ml) compared to MMImonotherapy (respectively: -25.7 pg/ml, CI 95%, -31.6 to -19.7 pg/ml and -22.9pg/ml, CI 95%, -28 to -17.3 pg/ml, p 0.002). Data at 270 days confirmed thistrend (-37.8 pg/ml, CI 95%, -43.6 to -32.1 pg/ml vs -24.4 pg/ml, CI 95%, -30.3 to-18.4 pg/ml). The quality of life (QoL) score was investigated by the validated"Thyroid-related Patient-Reported Outcome" questionnaire (ThyPRO). ThyPROcomposite score showed a greater improvement in the intervention group at 45 days(-14.6, CI 95%, -18.8 to -10.4), 180 (-9, CI 95%, -13.9 to -4.2) and 270 days(-14.3, CI 95%, -19.5 to -9.1) compared to MMI group (respectively, -5.2, CI 95%,-9.5 to -1; -5.4, CI 95%, -10.6 to -0.2 and -3.5, CI 95%, -9 to -2.1, p 0-6months and 6-9 months <0.05). Our results suggest that reaching optimal Se andVitD levels increases the early efficacy of MMI treatment when Se and VitD levelsare suboptimal.

TI  - The Combination of the CDK4/6 Inhibitor, Palbociclib, With the Vitamin D3 Analog,Inecalcitol, Has Potent In Vitro and In Vivo Anticancer Effects inHormone-Sensitive Breast Cancer, But Has a More Limited Effect in Triple-NegativeBreast Cancer.

AB  - Active vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3], and its synthetically derived analogs possess potent anticancer properties. In breast cancer (BC)cells, 1,25(OH)2D3 blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis throughdifferent cell-type specific mechanisms. In this study, we evaluated if thecombination of the potent vitamin D3 analog, inecalcitol, with a selective CDK4/6inhibitor, palbociclib, enhanced the antiproliferative effects of both singlecompounds in hormone-sensitive (ER(+)) BC, for which palbociclib treatment isalready approved, but also in triple-negative BC (TNBC). Inecalcitol andpalbociclib combination treatment decreased cell proliferation in both ER(+)(T47D-MCF7) and TNBC (BT20-HCC1143-Hs578T) cells, with a more pronouncedantiproliferative effect in the former. In ER(+) BC cells, the combinationtherapy downregulated cell cycle regulatory proteins (p)-Rb and (p)-CDK2 andblocked G1-S phase transition of the cell cycle. Combination treatmentupregulated p-mTOR and p-4E-BP1 protein expression in MCF7 cells, whereas itsuppressed expression of these proteins in BT20 cells. Cell survival wasdecreased after inecalcitol treatment either alone or combined in MCF7 cells.Interestingly, the combination therapy upregulated mitochondrial ROS andmitotracker staining in both cell lines. Furthermore, in vivo validation in aMCF7 cell line-derived xenograft mouse model decreased tumor growth and cellcycle progression after combination therapy, but not in a TNBC BT20 cellline-derived xenograft model. In conclusion, we show that addition of a potentvitamin D3 analog to selective CDK4/6 inhibitor treatment results in increasedantiproliferative effects in ER(+) BC both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - The hormonally-active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, can modulateboth innate and adaptive immunity, through binding to the nuclear vitamin Dreceptor expressed in most immune cells. A high dose of regular vitamin Dprotected non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice against type 1 diabetes (T1D), wheninitiated at birth and given lifelong. However, considerable controversy existson the level of circulating vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 25(OH)D3) needed to modulate the immune system in autoimmune-prone subjects and protect against T1Donset. Here, we evaluated the impact of two doses of dietary vitamin Dsupplementation (400 and 800 IU/day), given to female NOD mice from 3 until 25weeks of age, on disease development, peripheral and gut immune system, gutepithelial barrier function, and gut bacterial taxonomy. Whereas serum 25(OH)D3concentrations were 2.6- (400 IU/day) and 3.9-fold (800 IU/day) higher withdietary vitamin D supplementation compared to normal chow (NC), only the 800IU/day vitamin D-supplemented diet delayed and reduced T1D incidence compared to NC. Flow cytometry analyses revealed an increased frequency of FoxP3(+) Tregcells in the spleen of mice receiving the 800 IU/day vitamin D-supplemented diet.This vitamin D-induced increase in FoxP3(+) Treg cells, also expressing theecto-5'-nucleotidase CD73, only persisted in the spleen of mice at 25 weeks ofage. At this time point, the frequency of IL-10-secreting CD4(+) T cells was alsoincreased in all studied immune organs. High-dose vitamin D supplementation wasunable to correct gut leakiness nor did it significantly modify the increased gutmicrobial diversity and richness over time observed in NOD mice receiving NC.Intriguingly, the rise in alpha-diversity during maturation occurred especiallyin mice not progressing to hyperglycaemia. Principal coordinates analysisidentified that both diet and disease status significantly influenced theinter-individual microbiota variation at the genus level. The abundance of thegenera Ruminoclostridium_9 and Marvinbryantia gradually increased or decreased,respectively in faecal samples of mice on the 800 IU/day vitamin D-supplementeddiet compared to mice on the 400 IU/day vitamin D-supplemented diet or NC,irrespective of disease outcome. In summary, dietary vitamin D reduced T1Dincidence in female NOD mice at a dose of 800, but not of 400, IU/day, and wasaccompanied by an expansion of Treg cells in various lymphoid organs and analtered intestinal microbiota signature.

AB  - Several common pharmaceuticals such as ibuprofen, paracetamol, aspirin, oralcontraceptives, drugs for the prevention of motion sickness and food supplements such as table vitamins and minerals have been studied for the purposes ofretrospective dosimetry using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). Theessence is that the tablets with these drug substances contain additivecrystalline materials which, after irradiation and stimulation, may exhibitluminescence. For most of the pharmaceuticals and food supplements, aradiation-induced dose-dependent OSL signal was detected. Subsequently, basicdosimetric characteristics of the materials were studied, specificallysensitivity changes during repeated OSL readings, dose response, zero-dose,minimum detectable dose (MDD) and fading. The most radiation sensitive materials were food supplements with Mg providing zero-dose and MDD values at the level of several mGy. For Mg supplements, considerable sensitivity changes in OSL signalwere observed. Despite this, they could be corrected using a Single-AliquotRegenerative-dose (SAR) protocol. The OSL signals of the other materials wererelatively weak but they were well reproducible and exhibited linear doseresponse. The MDD values were variable among the materials and ranged from 0.1 toseveral Gy. However, for some of the pharmaceuticals, a very high and variablezero-dose of more than 3 Gy was observed that would rule out the possibility ofdose reconstruction for triage purposes. The OSL signal exhibited a significantfading rate for most of the materials. The measurements for dose reconstructionshould be performed as soon as possible after irradiation, i.e. within a maximum of a few days.

AB  - Pandemic COVID-19 warned the importance of preparing the immune system to preventdiseases. Therefore, consuming fresh fruits and vegetables is essential for ahealthy and balanced diet due to their diverse compositions of vitamins,minerals, fiber, and bioactive compounds. However, these fresh products grewclose to manure and irrigation water and are harvested with equipment or by hand,representing a high risk of microbial, physical, and chemical contamination. The handling of fruits and vegetables exposed them to various wet surfaces ofequipment and utensils, an ideal environment for biofilm formation and apotential risk for microbial contamination and foodborne illnesses. In thissense, this review presents an overview of the main problems associated withmicrobial contamination and the several chemicals, physical, and biologicaldisinfection methods concerning their ability to avoid food contamination. Thiswork has discussed using chemical products such as chlorine compounds,peroxyacetic acid, and quaternary ammonium compounds. Moreover, newer techniques including ozone, electrolyzed water, ultraviolet light, ultrasound, highhydrostatic pressure, cold plasma technology, and microbial surfactants have alsobeen illustrated here. Finally, future trends in disinfection with a sustainable approach such as combined methods were also described. Therefore, the fruit andvegetable industries can be informed about their main microbial risks toestablish optimal and efficient procedures to ensure food safety.

AB  - Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) encompasses a wide range ofdifferent non-mainstream therapies that have been increasingly used for thetreatment or adjunct treatment of various ailments, with premature ovarianfailure (POF) being one of the most common conditions treated with CAM. Thisreview updates the progress of CAM in the treatment of POF, and we focusspecifically on reviewing the evidence for the efficacy and mechanisms of a rangeof CAM treatments in POF, including single herbal medicines and their activeingredients, compound Chinese medicines, acupuncture and moxibustion,psychotherapy, exercise, vitamins, massage, and dietary supplements. According tothe literature, CAM is very helpful for improving POF symptoms, and we hope toprovide some instructive suggestions for clinical treatment and experimentalresearch in the future. However, more clinical trials are needed to prove thesafety of CAM.

AB  - The purpose of this experiment was to investigate the effects of differentsources of calcium on immune performance, diarrhea rate, intestinal barrier, and post-intestinal flora structure and function in weaned piglets. A total of 1,000 weaned piglets were randomly assigned to five groups 10 replicate pens pertreatment, 20 piglets per pen and fed calcium carbonate, calcium citrate,multiple calcium, and organic trace minerals of different concentrations ofacidifier diets. The results of the study showed that the replacement of calcium carbonate with calcium citrate and multiple calcium had almost no significanteffect on immune indexes (IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha) of piglets comparedwith the control group (p > 0.05). The five groups did not show a change in thediarrhea rate and diarrhea index (p > 0.05). The diet containing multiple calciumdramatically decreased the TP compared to the C and L diet (p < 0.05). Nosignificant difference in HDL was noted in the five groups (p > 0.05). However,the concentration of LDL in blood in the multiple calcium group was significantlyhigher than that in groups L and D (p < 0.05). Moreover, the concentration of Gluin blood in the multiple calcium group was significantly higher than that ingroup C (p < 0.05). Compared with the control group, calcium citrate plus organictrace minerals diet markedly increased UCG-005 abundance in the colon (p < 0.05).In addition, the relative abundance of Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group had an upward trend in the colon of the M group compared to the D group (p = 0.070). Meanwhile,calcium citrate plus organic trace minerals diet markedly increasedClostridium_sensu_stricto_1 abundance in the colon (p < 0.05). Metagenomicpredictions by PICRUSt suggested that the colonic and fecal microbiota was mainlyinvolved in carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism,and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins.

AB  - Cellobiose lipids (CL) are glycolipids synthesized by Ustilaginaceae species withpotential application as detergents or in cosmetics. This study identifiedprocess optimisation potential for CL fermentation based on process modelling andtechno-economic analysis. Using a stoichiometric equation based on laboratorydata, we calculated the maximum possible CL yield YP/S of 0.45 gCL.gglucose (-1) at the biomass yield of 0.10 gBiomass.gglucose (-1) with an Ustilago maydisstrain. Due to substrate inhibition that may occur at high glucoseconcentrations, a fed-batch process to increase biomass and CL concentrations wasconsidered in our model. Simulation of different process scenarios showed thatthe choice of aeration units with high oxygen transfer rates and adaptation ofpower input to oxygen uptake can significantly decrease electricity consumption. We further assessed scenarios with different fermentation media and CLpurification methods, suggesting additional process optimisation potential. Here the omission of vitamins from the fermentation medium proved to be a possiblemean to enhance process economy, without compromising CL productivity.

AB  - Propolis is a natural compound with anticarcinogenic properties. The presentstudy aimed to compare the inhibitory effect of ethanolic extract of propolis(EEP) and vitamin E on dimethylhydrazine-induced colon lesions in rats. In thisstudy, 60 rats were randomly categorized into six 10-member groups. After 13weeks, blood and colon tissue were sampled to examine some factors. Theparameters included red (RBC) and white (WBC) blood cell profile, lactatedehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), total protein (TP), creatinekinase (CPK), and albumin, as well as the extent of colon histological lesions,protein expression (adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and platelet-derived growthfactor (PDGF)), and oxidative stress markers (total antioxidant capacity (TAC),malondialdehyde (MDA), and superoxide dismutase (SOD)) in colon tissue. Asignificant decrease was observed in congestion, mitotic index, inflammation, andcell destruction in colon tissue in dimethylhydrazine group in comparison withthe control group (P < 0.05). The EEP exposed rats exhibited a significant lower oxidative stress than the DMH group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, the extractsignificantly affected TAC level (P < 0.05). While the expression level of APCrose substantially in the EEP-treated group compared to the DMH group, the level of PCNA, CEA, and PDGF proteins significantly reduced. It seems that the EEP can efficiently prevent DMH-induced colonic lesions. Furthermore, its effectivenessis more than the vitamin E, which is a strong antioxidant.

TI  - Isoflavaspidic Acid PB Extracted from Dryopteris fragrans (L.) Schott InhibitsTrichophyton rubrum Growth via Membrane Permeability Alternation and ErgosterolBiosynthesis Disruption.
PG  - 6230193
LID - 10.1155/2022/6230193 [doi]
AB  - Isoflavaspidic acid PB (PB), a phloroglucinol derivative extracted from aerialparts of Dryopteris fragrans (L.) Schott, had antifungal activity against severaldermatophytes. This study was aimed at exploring the antifungal mechanism of PBagainst Trichophyton rubrum (T. rubrum). The effectiveness of PB in inhibiting T.rubrum growth was detected by time-kill kinetics study and fungal biomassdetermination. Studies on the mechanism of action were investigated usingscanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM),sorbitol and ergosterol assay, nucleotide leakage measurement, and UPLC-basedtest and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fungicidal activity of PB wasconcentration- and time-dependent at 2 x MIC (MIC: 20 mug/mL) after 36 h. Thetotal biomass of T. rubrum was reduced by 64.17%, 77.65%, and 84.71% in thepresence of PB at 0.5 x MIC, 1 x MIC, and 2 x MIC, respectively. SEM analysisshowed that PB changed mycelial morphology, such as shrinking, twisting,collapsing, and even flattening. TEM images of treated cells exhibited abnormaldistributions of polysaccharide particles, plasmolysis, and cytoplasmic contentdegradation accompanied by plasmalemma disruption. There were no changes in theMIC of PB in the presence of sorbitol. However, the MIC values of PB wereincreased by 4-fold with exogenous ergosterol. At 4 h and 8 h, PB increasednucleotide leakage. Besides, ergosterol content in T. rubrum membrane treatedwith PB at 0.5 x MIC, 1 x MIC, and 2 x MIC was decreased by 9.58%, 15.31%, and76.24%, respectively. There was a dose-dependent decrease in the squaleneepoxidase (SE) activity. And the reduction in the sterol 14alpha-demethylase P450(CYP51) activity was achieved after PB treatments at 1 x MIC and 2 x MIC. Theseresults suggest that PB displays nonspecific action on the cell wall. Themembrane damaging effects of PB were attributed to binding with ergosterol toincrease membrane permeability and interfering ergosterol biosynthesis involvedwith the reduction of SE and CYP51 activities. Further study is needed to developPB as a natural antifungal candidate for clinical use.

TI  - Randomised trial of population-based BRCA testing in Ashkenazi Jews: long-termsecondary lifestyle behavioural outcomes.
LID - 10.1111/1471-0528.17253 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ashkenazi-Jewish (AJ) population-based BRCA testing is acceptable,cost-effective and amplifies primary prevention for breast & ovarian cancer.However, data describing lifestyle impact are lacking. We report long-termresults of population-based BRCA testing on lifestyle behaviour and cancer riskperception. DESIGN: Two-arm randomised controlled trials (ISRCTN73338115,GCaPPS): (a) population-screening (PS); (b) family history (FH)/clinical criteriatesting. SETTING: North London AJ-population. POPULATION/SAMPLE: AJ women/men >18years. EXCLUSIONS: prior BRCA testing or first-degree relatives of BRCA-carriers.METHODS: Participants were recruited through self-referral. All participantsreceived informed pre-test genetic counselling. The intervention included genetictesting for three AJ BRCA-mutations: 185delAG(c.68_69delAG), 5382insC(c.5266dupC)and 6174delT(c.5946delT). This was undertaken for all participants in the PS arm and participants fulfilling FH/clinical criteria in the FH arm. Patients filledout customised/validated questionnaires at baseline/1-year/2-year/3-yearfollow-ups. Generalised linear-mixed models adjusted for covariates andappropriate contrast tests were used for between-group/within-group analysis oflifestyle and behavioural outcomes along with evaluating factors associated with these outcomes. Outcomes are adjusted for multiple testing (Bonferroni method),with P < 0.0039 considered significant. OUTCOME MEASURES: Lifestyle/behaviouraloutcomes at baseline/1-year/2-year/3-year follow-ups. RESULTS: 1034 participants were randomised to PS (n = 530) or FH (n = 504) arms. No significant differencewas identified between PS- and FH-based BRCA testing approaches in terms ofdietary fruit/vegetable/meat consumption, vitamin intake, alcohol quantity/frequency, smoking behaviour (frequency/cessation), physical activity/exercise orroutine breast mammogram screening behaviour, with outcomes not affected by BRCA test result. Cancer risk perception decreased with time following BRCA testing,with no difference between FH/PS approaches, and the perception of risk waslowest in BRCA-negative participants. Men consumed fewerfruits/vegetables/vitamins and more meat/alcohol than women (P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Population-based and FH-based AJ BRCA testing have similar long-term lifestyle impacts on smoking, alcohol, dietary fruit/vegetable/meat/vitamin,exercise, breast screening participation and reduced cancer risk perception.

TI  - Liver in guinea pig: Scanning and transmission electron microscopic studies.
LID - 10.1002/jemt.24194 [doi]
AB  - The liver performs many functions, which support metabolism, immunity, digestion,detoxification, vitamin storage, and so on. The liver is the storage organ forfat-soluble vitamins, iron and copper. Six adult healthy guinea pigs of 16-32weeks of age (Irrespective of sex) were procured from the Department ofLaboratory Animal Medicine, TANUVAS as per ethical committee approval. Animalswere dissected as per CPCSEA norms and liver pieces were utilized for scanningelectron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study. Thestudy was performed to document the ultrastructural details of liver of guineapigs by SEM and TEM. By SEM, the liver parenchyma appeared as lobular withanastomosed one cell thick hepatic cell plates, which appeared as continuoussheets with small to large holes representing sinusoids. The sinusoidal lumen waslined by two types of cells namely endothelial cells and Kupffer cells.Endothelial cells had numerous large and small cytoplasmic fenestrations.Presence of Kupffer cells along with Ito cells were observed in the sinusoids. ByTEM, hepatocytes had angular shape with sinusoidal face and bile canalicularface. Hepatocytes had oval nucleus with peripheral heterochromatin and centralelectron lucent granules and a prominent nucleolus. Bile canaliculi were formedby two adjacent hepatocytes. Fenestrated endothelial cells with flat andelongated shape were found to be in the formation of hepatic sinusoidal wall. Anarrow space of Disse was found between the sinusoidal endothelium andhepatocytes. Kupffer cells and pit cells were found within the sinusoidal lumen. Ito cells were found in the space of Disse.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Besides their physiological properties, vitamins, such asvitamin C (ascorbic acid) and B6 (pyridoxine), ameliorate the symptoms ofallergic disorders. Because exocytosis in mast cells can be detectedelectrophysiologically by the changes in the membrane capacitance (Cm), itscontinuous monitoring in the presence of these vitamins would determine theirmast cell-stabilizing, anti-allergic properties. METHODS: Employing thewhole-cell patch-clamp technique in rat peritoneal mast cells, we examined theeffects of ascorbic acid and pyridoxine on the degranulation of mast cells andthe increase in the Cm during exocytosis. RESULTS: Both ascorbic acid andpyridoxine dose-dependently suppressed the GTP-gamma-S-induced increase in the Cmand inhibited the degranulation from mast cells. Surprisingly enough, relatively low concentrations of pyridoxine (1, 2 mM) synergistically enhanced thesuppressive effect of 2 mM ascorbic acid on mast cell degranulation. CONCLUSION: These results provided electrophysiological evidence for the first time thatascorbic acid and pyridoxine inhibited the process of exocytosis in adose-dependent manner. At relatively lower concentrations, these vitamins werenot enough to stabilize mast cells. However, such concentrations of pyridoxinesynergistically potentiated the mast cell-stabilizing property of ascorbic acid.

AB  - The oleaginous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has emerged as a powerful alternativefor biolipid production due to its high capacity for lipid accumulation. Genetic engineering and synthetic biology are promoted forward to improve production and reroute metabolism for high-value compound synthesis. In this context, efficient,modular, and high-throughput compatible cloning and expression system arerequired to speed up and rationalize research in this field. Here, we present thefast and modular Golden Gate cloning strategy for the construction of multigeneexpression vectors and their transformation into Y. lipolytica. As an example, weused the heterologous expression of the carotenoid pathway by cloning three genesinvolved in this pathway in only one vector allowing reaching production ofbeta-carotene after a single transformation.

AB  - Shellfish are a rich source of minerals, B-vitamins and omega-3 to the humandiet. The global population is expected to reach 9.6 billion people by 2050 wherethere will be increased demand for shellfish and for sustained improvements inharvesting. The production of most consumed species of shellfish is sea-based andare thus susceptible to in situ environmental conditions and water quality.Population growth has contributed to expansion of urbanization and the generationof effluent and waste that reaches aquatic environments, potentiallycontaminating seafood by exposure to non-treated effluents or inappropriatelydiscarded waste. Environmental contaminants as microplastics (MP),pharmaceuticals (PHAR) and potentially toxic contaminants (PTE) are beingidentified in all trophic levels and are a current threat to both shellfish andconsumer safety. Immunotoxicity, genotoxicity, fertility reduction, mortality andbioaccumulation of PTE are representative examples of the variety of effectsalready established in contaminated shellfish. In humans, the consumption ofcontaminated shellfish can lead to neurological and developmental effects,reproductive and gastrointestinal disorders and in extreme cases, death. Thistimely review provides insights into the presence of MP, PHAR and PTE inshellfish, and estimate the daily intake and hazard quotient for consumptionbehaviours. Alternatives approaches for seafood depuration that encompass riskreduction are addressed, to reflect state of the art knowledge from a Republic ofIreland perspective. Review of best-published literature revealed that MP, PHARand PTE contaminants were detected in commercialised species of shellfish, suchas Crassostrea and Mytilus. The ability to accumulate these contaminants byshellfish due to feeding characteristics is attested by extensive in vitrostudies. However, there is lack of knowledge surrounding the distribution ofthese contaminants in the aquatic environment their interactions with humans.Preventive approaches including risk assessment are necessary to safeguard theshellfish industry and the consumer.

AB  - A facile and sensitive method for sensing alpha-glucosidase (alpha-glu) andscreening its inhibitors based on fluorescence monitoring of water-solutesilicon-containing nanoparticles (Si CNPs) was proposed and demonstrated. Suchfluorescent nanoparticles can be easily produced by mixing (3-aminopropyl)trimethoxysilane (APTMS) and ascorbate sodium (AS) (both without fluorescencesignals) at room temperature and pressure. If the ascorbate sodium was replacedby L-ascorbic acid-2-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl (AA2G), which can be hydrolyzedinto the former by alpha-glu, the fluorescence "turn-on" biosensor for alpha-glu activity can be established. The sensing platform showegd a linear relationshipfrom 10 to 140 U/L and a low detection limit of 0.42 U/L, which is superior tomost approaches that have been reported. However, the hydrolysis procedure andsubsequent fluorogenic reaction could be blocked in the presence of alpha-gluinhibitors (AGIs), giving the possibilities of screening various inhibitors from different compounds. Furthermore, detection in human serum and applications inAGIs screening by using this method were also constructed, and showed satisfying results as well. It is proved that this developed biosensor can provide analternative strategy for potential clinic diagnosis and medicine development.

AB  - The apoptosis process could impose significantly by hyperglycemia. According toin silico language processing and high throughput raw data analysis, werecognized hub molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of diabetichearts and suggested a new pharmaceutical approach for declining myocardialprogramed cell death. Fifty male Sprague-Dawley rats were classified into fivegroups: healthy rats as control, diabetic rats, diabetic combinedresistance/endurance training, diabetic rats which consumed supplementationvitamins E and C, and the combined supplementation and training. Here, wecalculated changes in gene expression based on artificial intelligence methodsand evaluated gene expression in apoptotic influencing combined training andantioxidants vitamins consumption in heart injured models by streptozotocin viaReal-Time PCR. Moreover, we assessed the binding affinity of the 3D structure of small molecules on macromolecule SIRT3 to a new compound pharmaceuticalsuggesting the decline in cell death program. The computational intelligencesurveys revealed that the apoptosis process was a remarkable pathomechanism inthe abnormality function of heart tissue in diabetic conditions. Furthermore, we showed that synchronizing antioxidant vitamin consumption and regular combinedtraining could significantly decrease irreversible myocardial cell death indiabetic myocardiopathy. Hence, levels of antiapoptotic mRNA were modified in thecombined training/vitamin consumption group compared with other classifications. We found that regular combined exercise and vitamin consumption could reverse theapoptosis process to enhance the survival of cardiac muscle cells in diabetesconditions. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Machine learning and system biology indicatedthat the apoptosis process is a vital pathomechanism of hyperglycemia-inducedheart failure. Sirt3/Fas/Bcl-2/Cycs and Bax, as a critical network of apoptosis, play an essential role in heart failure induced by hyperglycemia. Moreover, Type 2 diabetes and obesity increase the risk of heart failure by increasing highblood sugar levels. We calculated the binding power of the vitamins E and C onSIRT3 protein based on the drug software. In addition, this study assessed thatregular combined training and vitamin consumption had an antiapoptotic effect.Also, our data might improve the hyperglycemia state.

AB  - Eight novel fluorescent antifolates were designed and docked with folatereceptors FRalpha and FRbeta. The structures of the complexes were furthercalculated by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. The binding energies werecalculated by molecular docking and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surfacearea (MM-PBSA) studies. The binding energy differences between FRalpha and FRbeta(|Ebalpha|-|Ebbeta|) values for compounds 3 and 8 were 1.3 and 1.1 kcal/molcalculated by molecular docking, and 13.9 and 10.4 kcal/mol by MM-PBSAsimulation, respectively. The results indicated that compounds 3 and 8 may be thebest candidates for targeted drug delivery to FRalpha. The binding structures,interaction residues, negatively charged pocket volume, and surface area wereanalyzed for all the complexes. We further calculated the root mean squaredisplacement and secondary structural elements of the bound complexes usingmolecular dynamics simulations. The purpose of this study is to design novelantifolates targeted to FRalpha and FRbeta, and to further distinguish betweencancer cells and inflammation.
