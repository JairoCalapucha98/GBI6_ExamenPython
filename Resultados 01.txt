TI  - Imagining a post-antibiotic era: a cultural analysis of crisis and antibioticresistance.
LID - medhum-2022-012409 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/medhum-2022-012409 [doi]
AB  - The study presented in this article is about the role played by imagination when national and international organisations convey the idea of a dystopian crisisinvolved in the real transition to a postantibiotic era. The present is an erathat can be defined as a time when no new antibiotics are discovered ordeveloped, and existing antibiotics simultaneously become less effective sincebacteria develop resistance against the active substances. Today, antibioticresistance is an international fact; thousands of people die every year in Europeand the USA as a result of bacteria that have become resistant. Then, imaginationcan conjure up a different and a much more dystopian future. This article stemsfrom a public debate concerning the global increase of antibiotic resistance; andwill examine how the concept of fantasy and imagination is central in picturingsuch a future crisis in society. The article's empirical basis mainly consists ofreports from global and Swedish organisations, dating from the 1990s and onwards.These fantasies show that our society has a strong urge to always try tounderstand and explain present time and to identify how 'our' era relates to the past as well as the future. The concept of crisis plays an important role inthese fantasies, it is key to use it when thinking about change. The analysisbuilds on texts and illustrations from global organisations like the WHO and alsonational authorities in Sweden that aim to convey the science behind thechallenge. The aim is to develop a theoretical and empirical understanding, from the perspective of cultural analysis, of how fantasy and crisis are linked whenthe future is conceived.

TI  - Development and validation of an early warning score to identify COVID-19 in the emergency department based on routine laboratory tests: a multicentrecase-control study.
PG  - e059111
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-059111 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Identifying patients with a possible SARS-CoV-2 infection in theemergency department (ED) is challenging. Symptoms differ, incidence rates varyand test capacity may be limited. As PCR-testing all ED patients is neitherfeasible nor effective in most centres, a rapid, objective, low-cost earlywarning score to triage ED patients for a possible infection is developed.DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Secondary and tertiary hospitals in theNetherlands. PARTICIPANTS: The study included patients presenting to the ED with venous blood sampling from July 2019 to July 2020 (n=10 417, 279SARS-CoV-2-positive). The temporal validation cohort covered the period from July2020 to October 2021 (n=14 080, 1093 SARS-CoV-2-positive). The externalvalidation cohort consisted of patients presenting to the ED of three hospitalsin the Netherlands (n=12 061, 652 SARS-CoV-2-positive). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES:The primary outcome was one or more positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results within 1day prior to or 1 week after ED presentation. RESULTS: The resulting'CoLab-score' consists of 10 routine laboratory measurements and age. The scoreshowed good discriminative ability (AUC: 0.930, 95% CI 0.909 to 0.945). Thelowest CoLab-score had high sensitivity for COVID-19 (0.984, 95% CI 0.970 to0.991; specificity: 0.411, 95% CI 0.285 to 0.520). Conversely, the highest score had high specificity (0.978, 95% CI 0.973 to 0.983; sensitivity: 0.608, 95% CI0.522 to 0.685). The results were confirmed in temporal and external validation. CONCLUSIONS: The CoLab-score is based on routine laboratory measurements and isavailable within 1 hour after presentation. Depending on the prevalence, COVID-19may be safely ruled out in over one-third of ED presentations. Highly suspectcases can be identified regardless of presenting symptoms. The CoLab-score iscontinuous, in contrast to the binary outcome of lateral flow testing, and canguide PCR testing and triage ED patients.

LID - 10.1093/femsle/fnac063 [doi]
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide used in the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm). However, the development of daptomycin-resistantVREfm challenges the treatment of nosocomial VREfm infections. Resistancemechanisms of daptomycin are not fully understood. Here we analysed the genomicchanges leading to a daptomycin-susceptible VREfm isolate becoming resistantafter 50 days of daptomycin and linezolid combination therapy. Seven isogenicVREfm isolates from the same patient (daptomycin-susceptible anddaptomycin-resistant) were analysed using Illumina whole genome sequencing, andtwo isolates were further characterised with Nanopore sequencing. Onenonsynonymous SNP in the rpoC gene previously shown to harbour mutations indaptomycin-resistant VREfm was identified in the daptomycin-resistant isolates.Whole genome comparative analysis identified the loss of a 46.5 kb fragment,duplication of a 29.7 kb fragment, and integration of two plasmids uponacquisition of daptomycin resistance. Transmission electron microscopy showedsimilar alterations in cell morphology and cell wall structure as have previouslybeen described in daptomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis.

TI  - Delta-like 4-Derived Notch Signals Differentially Regulate Thymic Generation ofSkin-Homing CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) Innate Lymphoid Cells at Neonatal and Adult Stages.
LID - ji2100870 [pii]
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2100870 [doi]
AB  - The thymus is a primary lymphoid organ for T cell development. Increasingevidence found that the thymus is also an important site for development ofinnate lymphoid cells (ILCs). ILCs generated in thymi acquire unique homingproperties that direct their localization into barrier tissues such as the skinand intestine, where they help local homeostasis. Mechanisms underlying thedevelopmental programming of unique tissue-homing properties of ILCs are poorlyunderstood. We report in this article that thymic stroma-derived Notch signaling is differentially involved in thymic generation of a population of NK1.1(+) group1 ILCs (ILC1s) with the CCR10(+) skin-homing property in adult and neonatal mice.We found that thymic generation of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s is increased in Tcell-deficient mice at adult, but not neonatal, stages, supporting the notionthat a large number of developing T cells interfere with signals required forgeneration of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s. In an in vitro differentiation assay,increasing Notch signals promotes generation of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s fromhematopoietic progenitors. Knockout of the Notch ligand Delta-like 4 in thymicstroma impairs generation of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s in adult thymi, butdevelopment of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s in neonatal thymi is less dependent onDelta-like 4-derived Notch signals. Mechanistically, the Notch signaling isrequired for proper expression of the IL-7R CD127 on thymic NK1.1(+) ILC1s, anddeficiency of CD127 also impairs thymic generation of CCR10(+)NK1.1(+) ILC1s atadult, but not perinatal, stages. Our findings advanced understanding ofregulatory mechanisms of thymic innate lymphocyte development.

TI  - CRISPR Activation Screening Identifies VGLL3-TEAD1-RUNX1/3 as a TranscriptionalComplex for PD-L1 Expression.
LID - ji2100917 [pii]
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2100917 [doi]
AB  - The PD-L1/2-PD-1 immune checkpoint is essential for the proper induction ofperipheral tolerance and limits autoimmunity, whereas tumor cells exploit theirexpression to promote immune evasion. Many different cell types express PD-L1/2, either constitutively or upon stimulation, but the factors driving thisexpression are often poorly defined. In this study, using genome-wide CRISPRactivation screening, we identified three factors that upregulate PD-L1expression: GATA2, MBD6, and transcription cofactor vestigial-like protein 3(VGLL3). VGLL3 acts as a transcriptional regulator, and its expression inducedPD-L1 in many different cell types. Conversely, loss of VGLL3 impairedIFN-gamma-induced PD-L1/2 expression in human keratinocytes. Mechanistically, by performing a second screen to identify proteins acting in concert with VGLL3, we found that VGLL3 forms a complex with TEAD1 and RUNX1/3 to drive expression ofPD-L1/2. Collectively, our work identified a new transcriptional complexcontrolling PD-L1/2 expression and suggests that VGLL3, in addition to its known role in the expression of proinflammatory genes, can balance inflammation byupregulating the anti-inflammatory factors PD-L1 and PD-L2.

TI  - Second-Generation Escherichia coli SuptoxR Strains for High-Level RecombinantMembrane Protein Production.
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.1c00598 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli is one of the most widely utilized hosts for recombinant proteinproduction, including that of membrane proteins (MPs). We have recentlyengineered a specialized E. coli strain for enhanced recombinant MP production,termed SuptoxR. By appropriately co-expressing the effector gene rraA, SuptoxRcan suppress the high toxicity, which is frequently observed during theMP-overexpression process, and, at the same time, enhance significantly thecellular accumulation of membrane-incorporated and properly folded recombinantMP. The combination of these two beneficial effects results in dramaticallyenhanced volumetric yields for various prokaryotic and eukaryotic MPs. Here, weengineered second-generation SuptoxR strains with further improved properties, sothat they can achieve even higher levels of recombinant MP production. Wesearched for naturally occurring RraA variants with similar or improved MPtoxicity-suppressing and production-promoting effects to that of the native E.coli RraA of the original SuptoxR strain. We found that the RraA proteins fromProteus mirabilis and Providencia stuartii can be even more potent enhancers ofMP productivity than the E. coli RraA. By exploiting these two newly identifiedRraAs, we constructed two second-generation SuptoxR strains, termed SuptoxR2.1and SuptoxR2.2, whose MP-production capabilities often surpass those of theoriginal SuptoxR significantly. SuptoxR2.1 and SuptoxR2.2 are expected to become widely useful expression hosts for recombinant MP production in bacteria.

TI  - Coronaviruses exploit a host cysteine-aspartic protease for replication.
LID - 10.1038/s41586-022-05148-4 [doi]
AB  - Highly pathogenic coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)(1,2), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV)(3), and SARS-CoV-1(4) vary in their transmissibility andpathogenicity. However, infection by all three viruses results in substantialapoptosis in cell culture(5-7) and in patient tissues(8-10), suggesting apotential link between apoptosis and pathogenesis of coronaviruses. Here we show that a cysteine-aspartic protease of the apoptosis cascade, caspase-6, serves as an important host factor for efficient coronavirus replication. We demonstratethat caspase-6 cleaves coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) proteins, generating Nfragments that serve as interferon (IFN) antagonists, thus facilitating virusreplication. Inhibition of caspase-6 substantially attenuates lung pathology and body weight loss of SARS-CoV-2-infected golden Syrian hamsters and improves thesurvival of mouse-adapted MERS-CoV (MERS-CoVMA)-infected human DPP4 knock-in(hDPP4 KI) mice. Overall, our study reveals how coronaviruses exploit a componentof the host apoptosis cascade to facilitate virus replication.

AB  - For the first time, the present review critically evaluates biodegradable polymermatrix composites containing graphene-related materials (GRMs) for antibacterial applications while discussing their development, processing routes, mechanicalproperties, and antibacterial activity. Due to its suitable biological propertiesand processability, chitosan has been the most widely used biodegradable polymer for the fabrication of GRM-containing composites with antibacterial properties.The majority of biodegradable polymers (including cellulose-, gelatine-, PVA-,PCL-, and PHA-based polymers) exhibit little to no antibacterial effect alone;however, they show significant antibacterial activity (>70%) when combined withGRMs. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that GRMs functionalization withbiodegradable polymers also reduces potential GRM cytotoxicity. Overall, GRMs in biodegradable polymer matrices provide attractive antibacterial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria (>30 different bacteria) along with improvedmechanical properties over pristine polymers, where the type and the degree ofimprovement provided by GRMs depend on the specific matrix. For example, theaddition of GRMs into chitosan, PVA, and PCL matrices increases their tensilestrength by 80%, 180%, and 40%, respectively. Challenges remain in understanding the effects of processing routes and post-processing methods on the antibacterialactivity and biocompatibility of biodegradable polymer/GRM composites. Giventheir promising properties and functionality, research on these composites isexpected to further increase along with the implementation of new compositesystems. These would include a wide range of applications, e.g., wound dressings,tissue engineering, drug delivery, biosensing, and photo-thermal therapy, as wellas non-medical use, e.g., antibacterial food packaging, water treatment, andantibacterial fabrics. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: : Graphene-related materials(GRMs) in polymer matrices can provide excellent antibacterial activity against abroad spectrum of bacteria together with improved mechanical properties (e.g.,tensile strength and elastic modulus) over pristine polymers; thus, researchefforts and applications of biodegradable polymer matrix composites containingGRMs have increased notably in the last ten years. For the first time, thepresent review critically evaluates biodegradable polymer matrix compositescontaining GRMs for antibacterial applications while discussing theirdevelopment, processing routes, mechanical properties, and antibacterialactivity. Future research directions for each composite system are proposed toshed light on overcoming the existing challenges in composite performance (e.g., mechanical properties, toxicity) reported in the literature.

AB  - Clostridium perfringens is a common anaerobic foodborne pathogen known to produce>20 toxins. In nature, this bacterium has 7 different toxinotypes (A-G) based on the presence of its 6 main toxins. The present study examined the occurrence ofdifferent toxinotypes of this bacterium in the ichthyofauna and aquaticenvironments of Kashmir Himalayan lakes, India. A total of 510 samples (210water; 150 each of common carp and snow trout) were collected from 3 differentlacustrine habitats (Dal, Anchar and Nigeen Lakes) of the region. By performing16S rRNA PCR test, it was observed that all 210 water samples and 80 (26.66%) of 300 fish samples tested for this specific bacterial species were positive. Thenby using multiplex-PCR targeting six virulence genes of C. perfringens, it wasconfirmed that all the 290 isolates from water and fish samples were positive forToxinotype A, as only cpa toxin gene was amplified. Phylogenetic analysis of the amplified gene and its amino-acid sequences revealed 95%-98% homology withanalogous sequences of this bacterial strain reported from China, Egypt andIndia. The study documents the existence of C. perfringens toxinotype A in theichthyofauna of Kashmiri Himalayan lakes, entailing that fish can likely act astransmission medium for C. perfringens food poisoning to humans via food.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) are at a high risk for the inflow and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathogens. However, owing to limitedlaboratory resources, little is known about the extent to which AMR organisms areendemic. METHODS: We performed active surveillance for carbapenem-resistantEnterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producingEnterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) in newly admitted patients at Marugame MedicalCenter, a nearly 200-bedded LTCH located in Kagawa, Japan. From August toDecember 2021, we tested stool samples from patients wearing diapers andconfirmed the genetic variants using specific PCR assays. We also collectedclinical variables and compared them between AMR carriers and non-carriers.RESULTS: Stool samples were collected from 75 patients, with a median age of 84years. CRE strain was not detected, but 37 strains of ESBL-E were isolated from32 patients (42.7%). During the study period, 4.9% of in-hospital patients (37per 756 patients) were identified to be ESBL-E carriers in the routinemicrobiological processing, suggesting that active surveillance detectedapproximately 9-fold more ESBL-E carriers. The blaCTX-M-9 group was the mostcommon (38.5%), followed by the blaTEM (26.9%). The clinical backgrounds of theESBL-E non-carriers and carriers were not significantly different. CONCLUSION:Our active screening demonstrated that nearly half of the patients hospitalizedor transferred to a Japanese LTCH were colonized with ESBL-E. We highlight theenforcement of universal basic infection prevention techniques at LTCHs wherepatients carrying AMR pathogens gather.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cat scratch disease (CSD) is an infectious disease caused byBartonella henselae. CSD follows a typical course, characterized by regionallymphadenopathy. In atypical CSD, the lesions spread to systemic organs and cancause fever of unknown origin (FUO). A previous study showed the usefulness ofwhole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI) without diffusion-weighted imaging(DWI) in the diagnosis of FUO, but there are no studies on the clinical utilityof whole-body DWI (WB-DWI). We herein report the case of an immunocompetent youngman in whom contrast-enhanced CT-unidentifiable multiple liver abscess andosteomyelitis were successfully detected by WB-DWI. Follow up with a liver biopsyhelped confirm an atypical CSD diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 23-year-oldpreviously healthy man was admitted for a 19-day history of high fever despite3-day treatment by azithromycin. His physical examination was unremarkable andcontrast-enhanced CT showed only a low attenuated area in the right lobe of theliver, indicating a cyst. WB-DWI revealed multiple nodular lesions ofhypo-diffusion in the liver, spine, and pelvic region. The biopsy specimens ofthe liver abscess showed no evidence of tuberculosis/malignancy and thepolymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of liver abscess aspirate showed positivefindings for B. henselae, confirming the diagnosis of CSD. He completedminocycline monotherapy for a total of 60 days without any deterioration.CONCLUSIONS: WB-DWI can be useful for the diagnosis of atypical CSD with hepatic and bone involvement, which can cause FUO in young immunocompetent adults.

AB  - Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a prevalent infection of the genitourinarytract affecting millions of women worldwide. In the present study, the importanceof virulence factors, ERG11 gene mutations, ERG11 gene expression, and plasmamembrane ergosterol content for fluconazole resistance in Candida species wasinvestigated in 200 women suspected of vulvovaginitis. Isolated Candida specieswere identified using the ITS-restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-RFLP)technique. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed according to the CLSI document. ERG11 gene expression was analyzed using real-time PCR. ERG11 genemutation analysis was performed using sequencing methods, and the ergosterolcontent of the cell membrane was determined in fluconazole-resistant isolates.Furthermore, the production of phospholipase and proteinase enzymes was evaluatedin recurrent and non-recurrent infections. VVC was diagnosed in 101 (50.5%) ofthe 200 clinical cases, of which 21 (20.8%) were confirmed as RVVC. Candidaalbicans was the most prevalent species, followed by C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. parapsilosis, and C. guilliermondii. Ketoconazole and fluconazolewere the most effective drugs against C. albicans among five tested antifungalswith MIC ranges between 0.06 and 16mug/mL and 0.25-64mug/mL. Substitutions ofA114S, Y257H, T123I and A114V were detected in fluconazole-resistant C. albicans.The ergosterol content of the fungal cell membrane and the mean levels of ERG11gene expression transcript were higher in fluconazole-resistant C. albicansisolates obtained from RVVC than in those obtained from VVC cases. Phospholipase and proteinase were produced in different amounts in all Candida species isolatedfrom VVC and RVVC cases. In this review, our results demonstrated that severalmolecular mechanisms, including ERG11 gene expression, changes in the cellmembrane ergosterol content, and mutations in ERG11 gene alone or simultaneously involved in fluconazole resistance of C. albicans species and the recurrence ofVVC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the principal etiological agent of acute bacterial meningitis (ABM) which has fatal outcome in children and elderly. Dueto poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation, conventional beta-lactamantibiotics fail to establish the requisite bactericidal concentration in centralnervous system leading to resistance in meningeal infections. The present studyintended to identify potential therapeutic alternatives against Streptococcalmeningitis. METHODS: Virtual screening, pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)and anti-bacterial evaluations were employed to screen potential drugs. Moleculardocking and structural dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the bindingaffinity and interaction stability of the drugs against the conventionalPenicillin binding protein (PBP) targets. Screened drugs were also checked forinteractions with other possible Streptococcal targets and relevant host targets.RESULTS: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) ketorolac and etodolacexhibiting high BBB-permeation and anti-bacterial potency were identified.Ketorolac and etodolac possessed uniform binding affinities against PBP1A, PBP2X,PBP2B and PBP3 with low inhibition constants (<50muM). Against PBP2B and PBP3,higher binding affinities were observed for ketorolac (-6.45 and -6Kcal/molrespectively) and etodolac (-6.36 and -6.55Kcal/mol respectively) than penicillin(-5.95 and -5.85Kcal/mol respectively) and cefotaxime (-5.08 and -5.07Kcal/molrespectively). The binding affinities were contributed by conventional H-bondsand non-canonical interactions with active site residues of PBPs. Structuraldynamics simulations further indicated the overall stability of the drug-boundcomplexes through minimal overall average root-mean square fluctuations (RMSFs)(<1.0A). The average binding affinities of Ketorolac and Etodolac with PBPs were marginally higher than other Streptococcal targets and comparable to theirconventional inflammatory targets. CONCLUSION: Pharmacological and structuralprofiles indicated that ketorolac and etodolac can potentially subdue the causeand effects of streptococcal meningitis and hence encourage experimentalvalidations.

AB  - Irrational use of antibiotics produces a large number of antibiotic-resistantbacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Wastewater treatmentplants (WWTPs) act as important sources and sinks of ARGs, and play an important role in their generation, treatment, and dissemination. This study summarized thetypes, concentrations, and factors of ARGs in WWTPs, investigated the sources of ARGs in wastewater, compared the removal efficiencies of different treatmentprocesses on ARGs, and analyzed the potential risk of ARGs accumulation ineffluent, sludge and their emission into the air. The results showed that themain ARGs detected in the influent of WWTPs were the genes resistant tomacrolides (ermB, ermF), tetracyclines (tetW, tetA, tetC), sulfonamides (sul1,sul2) and beta-lactams (blaOXA, blaTEM). The concentrations of ARGs in theinfluent of the WWTPs were 2.23x10(2)-3.90x10(9) copies/mL. Wastewater qualityand microbial community were the dominant factors that affected the distribution characteristics of ARGs. The accumulation of ARGs in effluent, sludge, andaerosols posed potential risks to the regional ecological environment and humanhealth. Based on these results, research trends with respect to ARGs in WWTPswere also prospected.

AB  - The rebound of black-odorous occurred in organic-rich sediments has become acritical issue due to its great harm to the ecological environment. Elements suchas S, C, and N play a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycle of black-odorousrivers. As electronic acceptors, Ca(NO3)2 and CaO2 can effectively removeacidified volatile sulfide (AVS) and organic matter to control the black-odorous rebound. However, the remediation mechanisms in organic-rich sediments byCa(NO3)2 and CaO2 are unclear. The present study explored the mechanism of C-N-S interconnection degradation in organic-rich urban river sediments by addingdifferent ratios and sequences of Ca(NO3)2 and CaO2. The results showed thatCa(NO3)2 remediation followed by CaO2 and the accepted electron ratio 1:1 ofCa(NO3)2 to CaO2 is an effective method for controlling the rebound ofblack-odorous and reducing the accumulation NO2(-)-N. Mainly attributed to that, CaO2 enhanced the degradation of organic matter by stimulating enzymaticactivities in the sediments, which is also the main reason for controlling therebound of black-odorous. Since CaO2 releases O2 and *OH, which inhibitnosZgenes, NO2(-)-N accumulates when remedied simultaneously with Ca(NO3)2 andCaO2. Co-occurrence network analysis illustrated that sulfur-driven autotrophicdenitrification bacteria, heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria, andsulfate-reducing bacteria interact strongly inside one module, clarifying a solidinteraction of C-N-S substances among these bacteria. Our results reveal theC-N-S interconnection degradation mechanism and provide a new perspective onapplying biochemical remediation in organic-rich urban river sediments.

AB  - Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i), commonly used drugs for treatment oftype 2 diabetes, increase the risk for bullous pemphigoid (BP). Currently themechanism leading to the loss of immunological tolerance of the cutaneousadhesion molecule BP180 as well as similarities and differences in diseaseprogression between DPP4i-associated BP (DPP4i-BP) and DPP4i independent"regular" BP (rBP) are largely unknown. We analyzed the expression of 32cytokines and two proteases by Luminex and ELISA assays in samples taken fromlesional and non-lesional skin of patients with rBP or DPP4i-BP, and healthycontrols. Cytokines mediating B-cell survival and targeting such as B-cellactivating factor (BAFF), CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 4, CXC chemokine ligand(CXCL) 12 and interleukin (IL) -6 were expressed at a higher level in thelesional rBP skin compared to that of DPP4i-BP. The DPP4i-BP samples hadincreased levels of eosinophilic cytokines CCL1, CCL17, CCL26 and IL-5, whichcorrelated with the serum level of anti-BP180 NC16A IgG autoantibodies. The mRNA expression of BAFF, IL-6, CCL1, CCL17, CCL26 and IL-5 measured by quantitativepolymerase chain reaction correlated with the protein levels. Taken together, thecutaneous cytokine profiles were found to provide distinctive molecularfingerprints between rBP and DPP4i-BP.

AB  - Secretion systems often utilize ATPase activity to facilitate the translocationof proteins into and across membranes. In bacteria, the universally conservedSecA ATPase binds a large repertoire of preproteins and interacts with the SecYEGtranslocon. In contrast, the type 7b secretion system (T7bSS) of Staphylococcusaureus supports the secretion of a restricted subset of proteins. T7bSSs arefound in several Firmicutes as gene clusters encoding for at least one secretedWXG100 protein and one protein with FtsK/SpoIIIE-like ATPase domains. In S.aureus, this ATPase is called EssC and comprises two cytosolicforkhead-associated domains (FHA1-2), two membrane-spanning segments (TM1-2), andfour cytosolic modules named DUF and ATPases 1 through 3 (D1D2D3). However, adetailed understanding of the interactions of EssC in the T7bSS is not clear.Here, we tagged EssC and performed affinity chromatography ofdetergent-solubilized extracts of wild type and isogenic mutants of S. aureus. Wefound that EssC recruits EsaA, EssA, and EssB in a complex referred to as the ESStranslocon, and secreted substrates were not required for translocon assembly.Furthermore, deletions of FHA1 and DUF rendered EssC unstable, while FHA2 wasrequired for association with EssB. This interaction was independent of EsaA, butEsaA was required to recruit EssA to the EssC-EssB complex. Finally, we showassembly of the ESS translocon was impaired upon mutation of D2 structuralmotifs. Together, our data indicate that the ESS translocon is maintained fullyassembled at the plasma membrane and that D2 is fundamental in sustaining theintegrity of this complex.

AB  - The molecular interactions that regulate chronic inflammation underlyingmetabolic disease remain largely unknown. Since the CD24-Siglec interactionregulates inflammatory response to danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), we have generated multiple mouse strains with single or combined mutations ofCd24 or Siglec genes to explore the role of the CD24-Siglec interaction inmetaflammation and metabolic disorder. Here, we report that the CD24-Siglec-Eaxis, but not other Siglecs, is a key suppressor of obesity-related metabolicdysfunction. Inactivation of the CD24-Siglec-E pathway exacerbates, while CD24Fc treatment alleviates, diet-induced metabolic disorders, including obesity,dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).Mechanistically, sialylation-dependent recognition of CD24 by Siglec-E inducesSHP-1 recruitment and represses metaflammation to protect against metabolicsyndrome. A first-in-human study of CD24Fc (NCT02650895) supports thesignificance of this pathway in human lipid metabolism and inflammation. Thesefindings identify the CD24-Siglec-E axis as an innate immune checkpoint againstmetaflammation and metabolic disorder and suggest a promising therapeutic target for metabolic disease.

TI  - Serum Uromodulin Levels Reflect Severity of Clinicopathological Findings in EarlyStage IgA Nephropathy.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1159/000525836 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Uromodulin (UMOD), also known as Tamm-Horsfall protein, is akidney-specific protein. Recently, low levels of urinary UMOD (uUMOD) have beenreported as a risk factor for renal function decline in IgA nephropathy (IgAN).However, the clinical significance of serum UMOD (sUMOD) is not clear. In thisstudy, we clarified the clinical significance of sUMOD in IgAN. METHODS: Onehundred eight biopsy-proven IgAN patients were included in this study. Therelationships between sUMOD levels and various clinicopathological findings were evaluated. RESULTS: sUMOD was positively correlated with estimated glomerularfiltration rate (eGFR) (p < 0.001, r = 0.5) and negatively correlated withcreatinine (Cr) (p < 0.0001, r = -0.51) and urinary protein (UP) (p = 0.005, r = -0.33). In the low sUMOD group (<145 ng/mL), Cr was significantly higher (p <0.0001) and histopathological changes were severe. The cumulative incidence of a 30% decline in eGFR was 25.6% overall, 0% in histological grade (H-G) I, 33.3% inH-G II, 59.6% in H-G III, and 66.7% in H-G IV. In univariate analyses, prognosticfactors for a 30% decline in eGFR were male, high UP, low albumin, low eGFR, and low sUMOD. When comparing the severe histopathological classes (H-G II-IV) andH-G I, low sUMOD was a risk factor for severe histopathological changes.Furthermore, in patients with eGFR > 60 (n = 74), multivariate analyses revealed that low sUMOD independently predicted a 30% decline in eGFR and having severehistopathological changes. CONCLUSION: In IgAN, sUMOD levels were associated withrenal function. Low sUMOD levels may be a risk factor for worsening renalfunction, especially in the early stage of IgAN.

AB  - The development of new antimicrobial agents is necessary to overcome the emergingantimicrobial resistance among infectious microbial pathogens. Herein, wesuccessfully designed and synthesized quinolinequinones (QQs) withN-phenylpiperazine (QQ1-7) containing strong or weak EDG in the amino moiety byconverting hydroxyquinoline (HQ) to the dichloroquinolinequinone (QQ) viachlorooxidation. We performed an extensive antimicrobial activity assessment ofthe QQs with N-phenylpiperazine (QQ1-7). Among the seven quinolinequinones (QQs) with N-phenylpiperazine tested, QQ3 and QQ4 were the most active moleculesagainst Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC(R) 29213) with a MIC value of 1.22 mug/mL. Inaddition to this, while QQ4 was more than six (6) times more effective towardsEnterococcus faecalis (ATCC(R) 29212), QQ3 was twenty-six (26) times moreeffective against same strain. Furthermore, the evaluation of antimicrobialactivity indicated that six of seven synthesized QQs (QQ1-4, QQ6, and QQ7)exhibited superior biological potency, eight (8) times for five of them (QQ1-4and QQ6) and two (2) times for QQ7, against Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC(R)12228). Besides, all QQs except QQ5 displayed excellent antifungal activityagainst the fungi Candida albicans (ATCC(R) 10231). Among these, the two QQs (QQ3and QQ4), which showed the lowest values against gram-positive bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC(R) 29213), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC(R)12228), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC(R) 29212)) as well as fungal strains(Candida albicans (ATCC(R) 10231) and Candida parapsilosis (ATCC(R) 22019)), werefurther evaluated for their biofilm inhibition properties and their mode ofaction with in vitro potential antimicrobial activity against each of 20clinically obtained resistant strains of gram-positive bacteria, and bactericidalactivity using time-kill curve assay. In this study, we investigated thebactericidal effects of QQ3 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA) and Candida albicans strains. The findings of this study suggest that asignificant bactericidal effect was seen with all tested 1 x MIC and 4 x MICconcentrations used within 24 h. Our findings present significant implicationsfor an antimicrobial drug candidate for treating infections, especially thosecaused by clinically resistant MRSA isolates.

AB  - The objective was to evaluate effects of niacin on the intestinal epithelialbarrier, intestinal immunity, and microbial community in weaned pigletschallenged by Porcine Deltacoronavirus (PDCoV). In this study, fifteen weanedpiglets were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups, (1) control group, normal diet; (2) PDCoV group, infected with 1 x 10(7) TCID50 of the PDCoV CHN-HN-17 strain by oral administration; (3) NA + PDCoV group, infected with 1 x 10(7) TCID50 of the PDCoV CHN-HN-17 strain by oral administration following administration of 40 mgof niacin for three days. The results showed that PDCoV infection induceddiarrhea and other clinical symptoms with intestinal villi shedding and atrophyin weaned piglets. Niacin alleviated the symptoms of diarrhea and intestinaldamage of PDCoV-infected weaned piglets. Additionally, PDCoV increased (P < 0.05)the mRNA expression of tight junction proteins [zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) andClaudin] and antimicrobial peptides [porcine beta defensin 1 (pBD1), pBD2,proline-arginine rich 39-amino acid peptide (PR39) and protegrin 1-5 (PG1-5) inthe jejunum and ileum of weaned piglets, while niacin increased (P < 0.05) theexpression of PG1-5 compared with PDCoV. PDCoV increased (P < 0.05) the contents of serum interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-8 and intestinal IL-8, and up-regulatedthe mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6,IL-10, IL-12, and IL-18 in ileum of weaned piglets compared with control.However, niacin decreased (P < 0.05) the contents of serum IL-1beta, IL-6 andintestinal IL-10 and IL-8, and also reduced (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression ofileal TNF-alpha, IL-10 and IL-12 in the PDCoV-infected piglets. Compared withcontrol, PDCoV up-regulated (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of key genes relatedto innate immune and antiviral molecules [toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), NOD1,NOD2, DDX58, CCL2, STAT2, Mx1, IFN-gamma, and protein kinase R (PKR) in the ileumof weaned piglets. Niacin decreased (P < 0.05) the mRNA expression of NOD1, NOD2,STAT2, IFN-gamma, and PKR in PDCoV-infected weaned piglets. Moreover, the mRNAexpression of IL-6 decreased (P < 0.05) and 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase(OAS), IFN-alpha, and PKR increased (P < 0.05) in PDCoV-infected IPEC-J2 cellstreated with niacin in vitro. Furthermore, niacin decreased (P < 0.05) theelevation of protein expression including inducible NOS (iNOS), nuclearfactor-kappaB (NF-kappaB p65), inhibitor kappa B (IKKbeta), histone deacetylase[Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7) and phosphorylation ofhistone H3 at serine s10 (pH3s10) in the ileum of PDCoV-infected piglets, andincreased (P < 0.05) the expression of G protein-coupled receptor (GPR109A).PDCoV disrupted the composition and structure of microflora in the colon ofweaned piglets, and reduced the relative abundance of the beneficial bacteriaSpirobacterium, but niacin could improve the intestinal microbial flora of thePDCoV-infected piglets associated with increasing the relative abundance ofLactobacillus. Overall, niacin could alleviate diarrhea, intestinal barrierdamages, intestinal immune response and colonic microflora disfunction inPDCoV-infected weaned piglets.

AB  - Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) has been applied to analyze bacterial cells and their responses to antibiotic exposure. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the origins of specific antibiotic response patterns andthe necessary experimental steps required to see them clearly in the SERSspectra, particularly involving SERS responses observed in the extracellularmatrix liquid of bacterial samples. In this study, a variety of experimentalparameters were tested to assess the antibiotic response patterns seen in liquid samples from E. coli under different conditions. These include testing the impactof washing the cells with water after incubating them with antibiotics, as wellas the effect of using different types of liquids with varying characteristicsfor incubating the bacteria with the antibiotics. It was found that theexperimental procedure has a significant impact on the resulting SERS signals,and the target patterns could only be observed in specific conditions. Inparticular, the step of washing the bacteria with water is necessary forobserving the antibiotic response patterns, and incubating the bacteria andantibiotics in a nutrient-rich growth medium is preferable to incubating thecells in a buffer or in distilled water. These findings can be used to improveexisting methods for testing antibiotic responses with SERS, and couldpotentially help to further develop and optimize SERS-based procedures forassessing antibiotic sensitivity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, internal European borders weretemporarily re-established to mitigate the outbreak. Much research on pandemicborder control measures has focused on quantifying their effectiveness forinfectious disease control as well as on their social consequences forcross-border life in the European Union. However, little attention has been paid to the impacts for the practice and organisation of cross-border public health.To address this gap, the present study analysed the experiences and perspectives of public health professionals working in European border regions regardingborder control measures in the pandemic. STUDY DESIGN: Qualitativeinterview-based study. METHODS: In total, 27 semistructured interviews withpublic health professionals were conducted in the border regions between Germany,the Netherlands and Belgium. Participants were asked about their perspectives on border control and the spread of COVID-19 in the region. Interviews wereperformed between December 2020 and April 2021 and carried out in German,English, Dutch and French. RESULTS: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, borders hadbecome largely invisible with extensive cross-border social life and mobility.Participants were sceptical about the role of cross-border mobility as a pandemicdriver and consequently the effectiveness of enforcing border control forreducing the spread of COVID-19 in their border regions. At the same time,participants raised concerns about the negative consequences for the socialfabric and provision of cross-border public health. CONCLUSIONS: Public healthprofessionals highlighted the uncertain role of border control measures forregional infectious disease control in border regions. Rather than bordercontrol, sustainable cross-border communication and collaboration is crucial toensure effective pandemic management in border regions.

Dozens of regioisomers and enantiomers of TAGs containing one, two orthree hexadecenoic acids have been identified by means of reversed phasechromatography/mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC/MS). The regioisomers of TAGscontaining two palmitic acids and any hexadecenoic acid were separated. Analysis of regioisomers of TAGs having one Pv residue showed that asymmetric molecularspecies such as PvPP or PPPv were dominant in Rhizophagus. TAGs were alsoanalyzed on a chiral phase column and nine molecular species of TAGs containingtwo palmitic and any of three hexadecenoic acids were separated and identified.In the case of TAGs containing one palmitic and two hexadecenoic acids, theseparation was successful only if the hexadecenoic acids were identical.Separation of TAGs containing three hexadecenoic acids was successful only if allthree hexadecenoic acids were identical. Regardless of the type of TAG, it wasfound that TAGs in the AM fungus and containing palmitvaccenic acid bound at the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone were dominant, suggesting similarity inthe biosynthesis of the different TAGs. The covalent adduct chemical ionizationmethod was used for identification of TAGs as adduct with(1-methyleneimino)-1-ethenyl ion, which reacted with double bond of theunsaturated fatty acid. Tandem MS thus makes it possible to identify TAGscontaining various hexadecenoic acids.

TI  - Viability study of clinical bacterial strains by capillary electrophoresis andflow cytometry approaches.
LID - 10.1002/elps.202200096 [doi]
AB  - One of the challenges medicine faces is the constantly growing resistance ofpathogens to various classes of antibiotics. In this study, we investigated theuse of capillary electrophoresis (CE) to characterize and assess thephysiological states of three clinical bacterial strains - Staphylococcus aureus methicillin-resistant (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive (MSSA), and Escherichiacoli ESbetaL - exposed to different antibiotics. All chosen bacteria are theleading causes of healthcare-associated and hospital-acquired invasive infectionsin adults. In the first part of the research, it was determined the optimalincubation time of the tested strains with antibiotics, represented as an optimaltime 24 hours. In the second part, we have compared two approaches: flowcytometry (FC) as a standard method and CE as a proposed alternative approach.The viability of clinical strains treated with different class antibioticscalculated in CE measurements, was strongly correlated (>0.83 for MSSA, >0.92 forESbetaL and MRSA) with the viability obtained on the basis of FC measurements. Asa result, CE has a chance to become a modern diagnostic method used in clinicalpractice. The CE cut-off was found to be 50%; above this value, the strain shows resistance to the action of the antibiotic. This article is protected bycopyright. All rights reserved.

TI  - Get2PrEP: An EMR Lab Comment Increased Safe Sex Counseling but not PrEP Services at a Large Urban Academic Medical Center in Northern Manhattan.
LID - 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001682 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) remains underutilized despite its efficacy and potential population impact. Achieving PrEP's full potential dependsupon providers who are knowledgeable and comfortable prescribing it toindividuals at risk of acquiring HIV. Previous educational interventionstargeting provider-related uptake barriers have had limited success. We designed and tested an electronic medical record (EMR) interpretative comment to improvethe delivery of PrEP. METHODS: An EMR comment provided information on PrEPeligibility and referral resources to providers delivering positive chlamydia andgonorrhea results. Positive tests for bacterial sexually transmitted infectionspre-intervention (01/01/19 - 08/23/19) and post-intervention (08/24/19 -12/31/19) were identified. A retrospective chart review was conducted toascertain provider documentation of PrEP discussions or provision, HIV preventiondiscussions, and HIV screening. Pretest-posttest analysis was performed tocompare the provision of PrEP and HIV prevention services. RESULTS: We reviewed856 pre-intervention encounters spanning eight months and 461 post-encountersspanning four months. Patient demographics were comparable. We observed anincrease in provider documentation of safe sex and condom counseling(respectively, OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.07-1.18: OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.05-1.17), and theabsence of any HIV prevention discussion decreased (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.80-0.90),but not HIV screening or PrEP documentation. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that anEMR lab comment had a modest effect on increasing risk reduction counseling,though not HIV screening or PrEP prescriptions. Future strategies to encourageprovider delivery of sexual health services may benefit from more targetedstrategies that combine behavioral and IT approaches.

TI  - Advancing Sexual Harassment Prevention and Elimination in the Sciences: "Everysexual health organization must do something similar."
LID - 10.1097/OLQ.0000000000001683 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sexual harassment is pervasive in science. A 2018 report found thatthe prevalence of sexual harassment in academia in the U.S. is 58%. An activityheld at an international scientific congress was designed to advance sexualharassment prevention and elimination and empower binary and non-binary personsat risk for harassment, discrimination, and violence. The objective is todescribe the activity and outcomes to provide a promising model for otherscientific communities. METHODS: A description of the plenary and key components as well as the data collection and analysis of selected outcomes are provided.RESULTS: Among 1,338 congress participants from 61 countries, 526 (39%) attended the #MeToo plenary and the majority engaged in some way during the plenarysession. Engagement included standing for the pledge (~85%), participating in thequestion and answer session (n = 5), seeking counseling (n = 3), and/or providingwritten post-it comments (n = 96). Respondents to a post-congress survey (N =388, 24% of all attendees) ranked the plenary as number one among 14congressional plenaries. In post-analysis, the written post-it comments weresorted into 14 themes within 6 domains including: (1) emotional responses, (2)barriers to speaking out, (3) public health priorities, (4) reframing narratives about the issue, (5) allyship, and (6) moving the issue forward. CONCLUSIONS:Scientific organizations, agencies, and institutions have an important role toplay in setting norms and changing enabling policies towards a zero-toleranceculture of sexual harassment. The activity presented offers a promising model forscientific communities with similar goals. The outcomes suggest that the plenary successfully engaged participants and had a measurable impact on theparticipants.

TI  - Engineering Critical Amino Acid Residues of Lanosterol Synthase to Improve theProduction of Triterpenoids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.2c00098 [doi]
AB  - Triterpenoids are a subgroup of terpenoids and have wide applications in thefood, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. The heterologous production ofvarious triterpenoids in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as other microbes, hasbeen successfully implemented as these production hosts not only produce theprecursor of triterpenoids 2,3-oxidosqualene by the mevalonate pathway but alsoallow simple expression of plant membrane-anchored enzymes. Nevertheless,2,3-oxidosqualene is natively converted to lanosterol catalyzed by the endogenouslanosterol synthase (Erg7p), causing low production of recombinant triterpenoids.While simple deletion of ERG7 was not effective, in this study, the criticalamino acid residues of Erg7p were engineered to lower this critical enzymeactivity. The engineered S. cerevisiae indeed accumulated 2,3-oxidosqualene up to180 mg/L. Engineering triterpenoid synthesis into the ERG7-modified strainresulted in 7.3- and 3-fold increases in the titers of dammarane-type andlupane-type triterpenoids, respectively. This study presents an efficientinducer-free strategy for lowering Erg7p activity, thereby providing2,3-oxidosqualene for the enhanced production of various triterpenoids.

LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiac334 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this randomized, controlled trial is to determine whetheranti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin protects against severe COVID-19 in severelyimmunocompromised, hospitalized, COVID-19 patients. Patients were randomlyassigned to receive anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune globulin (COVIG) or intravenousimmunoglobulin without SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Severe COVID-19 was observed in twoout of ten (20%) patients treated with COVIG compared to seven out of eight (88%)in the IVIG control group (p = 0.015, Fisher's exact test). COVIG may be avaluable treatment in severely immunocompromised, hospitalized, COVID-19 patientsand should be considered when no monoclonal antibody therapies are available. Thetrial was registered at www.trialregister.nl (#NL9436).

AB  - We evaluated the performance of nasal and nasopharyngeal Standard Q COVID-19 Agtests (SD Biosensor) and the Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (nasal, Abbott)against the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay during the Omicron (21 M, 21K and21L) wave in South Africa. Overall, all evaluated tests performed well with high level of sensitivity (ranging from 77.78-81.42%) and excellent specificity values(>99%). The sensitivity of rapid antigen tests increased above 90% in sampleswith Ct <20, and all three tests performed best within first week of symptomonset. The Panbio Ag test performed best in the context of Omicron 21Linfections, that were also characterised by significantly lower Ct valuescompared to infections with 21K and 21 M.

AB  - Several monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (mAbs) have received emergencyauthorization for COVID-19 treatment. However, most of these mAbs are not active against the highly mutated Omicron SARS-CoV-2 subvariants. We have tested apolyclonal approach of equine anti-SARS-CoV-2 F(ab')2 antibodies that achieved a high level of neutralizing potency against all SARS-CoV-2 VoCs tested includingOmicron BA.1, BA.2, BA.2.12 and BA.4/5. A repertoire of antibodies targetingconserved epitopes in different regions of the spike protein could plausiblyaccount for this remarkable breadth of neutralization. These results warrant the clinical investigation of equine polyclonal F(ab')2 antibodies as a noveltherapeutic strategy against COVID-19.

LID - 10.1080/19490976.2022.2106105 [doi]
AB  - The probiotic bacterial strain Enterococcus faecium SF68 has been shown toalleviate symptoms of intestinal inflammation in human clinical trials and animalfeed supplementation studies. To identify factors involved in immunomodulatoryeffects on host cells, E. faecium SF68 and other commensal and clinicalEnterococcus isolates were screened using intestinal epithelial cell linesharboring reporter fusions for NF-kappaB and JNK(AP-1) activation to determinethe responses of host cell innate immune signaling pathways when challenged with bacterial protein and cell components. Cell-free, whole-cell lysates of E.faecium SF68 showed a reversible, inhibitory effect on both NF-kappaB andJNK(AP-1) signaling pathway activation in intestinal epithelial cells andabrogated the response to bacterial and other Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands.The inhibitory effect was species-specific, and was not observed for E. avium, E.gallinarum, or E. casseliflavus. Screening of protein fractions of E. faeciumSF68 lysates yielded an active fraction containing a prominent protein identifiedas arginine deiminase (ADI). The E. faecium SF68 arcA gene encoding argininedeiminase was cloned and introduced into E. avium where it conferred the sameNF-kappaB inhibitory effects on intestinal epithelial cells as seen for E.faecium SF68. Our results indicate that the arginine deiminase of E. faecium SF68is responsible for inhibition of host cell NF-kappaB and JNK(AP-1) pathwayactivation, and is likely to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory andimmunomodulatory effects observed in prior clinical human and animal trials. The implications for the use of this probiotic strain for preventive and therapeutic purposes are discussed.

AB  - Fruits of Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck var. Valencia contain hesperidin as a majorflavanone glycoside. Hesperidin (H) was isolated from the peels of Valenciaorange and formulated as hexosomal nanodispersions (F1) adopting the hotemulsification method. The antimycobacterial activity(anti-TB) was evaluatedthrough a microplate Alamar blue (MABA) assay where F1 showed significantactivity with MIC = 0.19 microM. To unravel the potential mechanism of theanti-TB, a molecular docking study of H using the Mycobacterial Dihydrofolatereductase (Mtb. DHFR) enzyme was performed. Hesperidin exhibited significantinteractions with Mtb. DHFR active site. Sulforhodamine B assay was applied toevaluate cytotoxic activity against the lung cancer cell line (A-549). F1 showed a cytotoxic effect at IC50= 33 microM. It also has potent antiviral activityagainst Human Coronavirus 229E with IC50= 258.8 muM utilising crystal violetassay. Peels of Valencia orange could be a source of bioactive metabolites tocontrol significant diseases.

TI  - The Antibacterial Action of Safranin and Gentian Violet.
LID - 10.5041/RMMJ.10475 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing resistance of many bacterial pathogens againstantibiotic measures urgently requires new or repurposing therapeutic strategies. Gentian violet is a triarylmethane dye used as a histological stain and forGram's method of classifying bacteria. It also exerts an antimicrobial effectagainst certain pathogens, especially dermatological infections. Safranin is the most popular counterstain used in medical laboratories due to its low cost andsafe laboratory usage. However, few studies have been conducted on theantimicrobial activity of safranin. OBJECTIVE: With the growing prevalence ofmultidrug-resistant bacteria, this study aimed to evaluate the antibacterialefficacy of gentian violet and safranin against multidrug-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa).METHODS: All tested bacteria were multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria isolatedfrom skin infections (abscesses and wounds). Using gentian violet and safranin,antibacterial effects were studied using the well-diffusion method against 20samples of clinically isolated bacteria, 10 diagnosed as S. aureus, and 10 as P. aeruginosa. Bacteria were diagnosed using the VITEK 2 automated system(bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France). Iodine served as the control agent, sinceboth Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria are sensitive to it. RESULTS:Gentian violet dye has been shown to be 100% sensitive to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial isolates. Although safranin also had high sensitivity(100%) to S. aureus isolates, its sensitivity to P. aeruginosa was only 20%.Staphylococcus aureus was more resistant to iodine (40% sensitivity) compared to P. aeruginosa, which was 100% sensitive to iodine. CONCLUSIONS: Gentian violetand safranin are low-cost and better tolerated topical agents that have potentialfor use in dermatological applications. Gentian violet had good antibacterialactivity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, making it useful for treating bacterial skin pathogens such as S. aureus and P. aeruginosaespecially for MDR bacteria. While safranin has good efficacy againstGram-positive bacteria (S. aureus), its effect against Gram-negative bacteria(e.g. P. aeruginosa) is poor.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms promoting chromosomal translocations of therearranging receptor loci in leukemia and lymphoma remains incomplete. Here weshow that leukemias induced by aberrant activation of beta-catenin in thymocytes,which bear recurrent Tcra/Myc-Pvt1 translocations, depend on Tcf-1. The DNAdouble strand breaks (DSBs) in the Tcra site of the translocation areRag-generated, whereas the Myc-Pvt1 DSBs are not. Aberrantly activatedbeta-catenin redirects Tcf-1 binding to novel DNA sites to alter chromatinaccessibility and down-regulate genome-stability pathways. Impaired homologousrecombination (HR) DNA repair and replication checkpoints lead to retention ofDSBs that promote translocations and transformation of double-positive (DP)thymocytes. The resulting lymphomas, which resemble human T cell acutelymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), are sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPis). Ourfindings indicate that aberrant beta-catenin signaling contributes totranslocations in thymocytes by guiding Tcf-1 to promote the generation andretention of replication-induced DSBs allowing their coexistence withRag-generated DSBs. Thus, PARPis could offer therapeutic options in hematologicmalignancies with active Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

PG  - e2123362119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2123362119 [doi]
AB  - The germinal center (GC) plays a central role in the generation ofantigen-specific B cells and antibodies. Tight regulation of the GC is essential due to the inherent risks of tumorigenesis and autoimmunity posed byinappropriate GC B cell processes. Gammaherpesviruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) utilize numerous armaments to drive infected naive B cells, independent of antigen, through GC reactions to expandthe latently infected B cell population and establish a stable latency reservoir.We previously demonstrated that the MHV68 microRNA (miRNA) mghv-miR-M1-7-5prepresses host EWSR1 (Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1) to promote B cellinfection. EWSR1 is a transcription and splicing regulator that is recognized forits involvement as a fusion protein in Ewing sarcoma. A function for EWSR1 in Bcell responses has not been previously reported. Here, we demonstrate that 1) Bcell-specific deletion of EWSR1 had no effect on generation of mature B cellsubsets or basal immunoglobulin levels in naive mice, 2) repression or ablationof EWSR1 in B cells promoted expansion of MHV68 latently infected GC B cells, and3) B cell-specific deletion of EWSR1 during a normal immune response to nonviral antigen resulted in significantly elevated numbers of antigen-specific GC Bcells, plasma cells, and circulating antibodies. Notably, EWSR1 deficiency didnot affect the proliferation or survival of GC B cells but instead resulted inthe generation of increased numbers of precursor GC B cells. Cumulatively, these findings demonstrate that EWSR1 is a negative regulator of B cell responses.

TI  - Organohalide Respiration with Diclofenac by Dehalogenimonas.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.1c08824 [doi]
AB  - Diclofenac (DCF) is a pharmaceutically active contaminant frequently found inaquatic ecosystems. The transformation pathways and microbiology involved in the biodegradation of DCF, particularly under anoxic conditions, remain poorlyunderstood. Here, we demonstrated microbially mediated reductive dechlorinationof DCF in anaerobic enrichment culture derived from contaminated river sediment. Over 90% of the initial 76.7 +/- 3.6 muM DCF was dechlorinated at a maximum rate of 1.8 +/- 0.3 muM day(-1) during a 160 days' incubation. Mass spectrometricanalysis confirmed that 2-(2-((2-chlorophenyl)amino)phenyl)acetic acid (2-CPA)and 2-anilinophenylacetic acid (2-APA) were formed as the monochlorinated andnonchlorinated DCF transformation products, respectively. A survey of microbialcomposition and Sanger sequencing revealed the enrichment and dominance of a new Dehalogenimonas population, designated as Dehalogenimonas sp. strain DCF, in the DCF-dechlorinating community. Following the stoichiometric conversion of DCF to2-CPA (76.0 +/- 2.1 muM) and 2-APA (3.7 +/- 0.8 muM), strain DCF cell densitiesincreased by 24.4 +/- 4.4-fold with a growth yield of 9.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(8) cellsper mumol chloride released. Our findings expand the metabolic capability in the genus Dehalogenimonas and highlight the relevant roles of organohalide-respiring bacteria for the natural attenuation of halogenated contaminants of emergingconcerns (e.g., DCF).

LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0009964 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is an endemic disease in Rwanda, but littleis known about its prevalence and causative mycobacterial species. The diseasecauses tremendous losses in livestock and wildlife and remains a significantthreat to public health. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study employinga systematic random sampling of cattle (n = 300) with the collection ofretropharyngeal lymph nodes and tonsils (n = 300) irrespective of granulomatouslesions was carried out in six abattoirs to investigate the prevalence andidentify mycobacterial species using culture, acid-fast bacteria staining,polymerase chain reaction, and GeneXpert assay. Individual risk factors and theorigin of samples were analysed for association with the prevalence. FINDINGS: Ofthe 300 sample pools, six were collected with visible TB-like lesions. Ourfindings demonstrated the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC)in 1.7% (5/300) of sampled slaughtered cattle. M. bovis was isolated from 1.3%(4/300) animals while one case was caused by a rifampicin-resistance (RR) M.tuberculosis. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria were identified in 12.0% (36/300) ofthe sampled cattle. There were no significant associations between the prevalenceand abattoir category, age, sex, and breeds of slaughtered cattle. CONCLUSIONS:This study is the first in Rwanda to isolate both M. bovis and RR M. tuberculosisin slaughtered cattle indicating that bTB is present in Rwanda with a lowprevalence. The isolation of RR M. tuberculosis from cattle indicates possiblezooanthroponotic transmission of M. tuberculosis and close human-cattle contact. To protect humans against occupational zoonotic diseases, it is essential tocontrol bTB in cattle and raise the awareness among all occupational groups aswell as reinforce biosafety at the farm level and in the abattoirs.

AB  - Canonical aminoglycosides are a large group of antibiotics, where the part ofchemical diversity stems from the substitution of the neamine ring system onpositions 5 and 6. Certain aminoglycoside modifying enzymes can modify a broadrange of 4,5- and 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides, with some as many as 15.This study presents the structural and kinetic results describing a promiscuousaminoglycoside acetyltransferase AAC(3)-IIIa. This enzyme has been crystallizedin ternary complex with coenzyme A and 4,5- and 4,6-disubstitutedaminoglycosides. We have followed up this work with kinetic characterizationutilizing a panel of diverse aminoglycosides, including a next-generationaminoglycoside, plazomicin. Lastly, we observed an alternative binding mode ofgentamicin in the aminoglycoside binding site, which was proven to be acrystallographic artifact based on mutagenesis.

TI  - Modelling inflammatory biomarker dynamics in a human lipopolysaccharide (LPS)challenge study using delay differential equations.
LID - 10.1111/bcp.15476 [doi]
AB  - Clinical studies in healthy volunteers challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a constituent of the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria, represent a key modelto characterize the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated inflammatory response.Here, we developed a mathematical modelling framework to quantitativelycharacterize the dynamics and inter-individual variability of multipleinflammatory biomarkers in healthy volunteer LPS challenge studies. Data frompreviously reported LPS challenge studies were used, which includedindividual-level time course data for tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha),interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin 8 (IL-8), and C-reactive protein (CRP). Aone-compartment model with first-order elimination was used to capture the LPSkinetics. The relationships between LPS and inflammatory markers wascharacterized using indirect response (IDR) models. Delay differential equations were applied to quantify the delays in biomarker response profiles. For LPSkinetics, our estimates of clearance and volume of distribution were 35.7 L h(-1)and 6.35 L, respectively. Our model adequately captured the dynamics of multiple inflammatory biomarkers. The time delay for the secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8 were estimated to be 0.924, 1.46 and 1.48 h, respectively. A second IDRmodel was used to describe the induced changes of CRP in relation to IL-6, with adelayed time of 4.2 h. The quantitative models developed in this study can beused to inform design of clinical LPS challenge studies and may help to translatepreclinical LPS challenge studies to humans.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0268411 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the abundance and distribution ofpsychrophilic microorganisms associated with spoilage in beef slaughterhouseenvironments after cleaning. The processing lines and equipment used inslaughtering and boning were swabbed, and the microbial count was determinedusing a TSA and MRS medium and Chromocult(R) Coliform agar incubated at 15masculineC and 37 masculineC, respectively. As a result, the brisket saw (handle side) and trolley hook were the most heavily contaminated with microorganisms,with each having a microbial adhesion rate of 66.7%. The microbial adhesion ratesof the apron and milling cutter (edge side) were 50%, respectively, and those of the foot cutter (edge and handle side), splitting saw (edge side), and knife(handle side) were 33.3%, respectively. Next, four colonies were randomlyisolated from the petri dish used for the bacterial count measurement to identifythe predominant microbial species of the microorganisms attached to eachequipment. As a result of Sanger sequencing analysis, yeasts such as Candidazeylanoides and Rhodotorula sp. and bacteria including Pseudomonas sp. andRhodococcus sp. were identified from the equipment used in the slaughtering line,and it was assumed that these microorganisms were of environmental origin. Incontrast, only Pseudomonas sp. and Candida zeylanoides were isolated from theboning line. Despite the use of cleaning operations, this study identified someequipment was contaminated with microorganisms. Since this equipment frequentlycomes into direct contact with the carcass, it is critical to thoroughly removethe microorganisms through accurate cleaning to prevent the spread of microbialcontamination on the carcasses.

TI  - Implementation of a Novel Optogenetic Tool in Mammalian Cells Based on a Split T7RNA Polymerase.
LID - 10.1021/acssynbio.2c00067 [doi]
AB  - Optogenetic tools are widely used to control gene expression dynamics both inprokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. These tools are used in a variety of biologicalapplications from stem cell differentiation to metabolic engineering. Despitesome tools already available in bacteria, no light-inducible system currentlyexists to control gene expression independently from mammalian transcriptionaland/or translational machineries thus working orthogonally to endogenousregulatory mechanisms. Such a tool would be particularly important in syntheticbiology, where orthogonality is advantageous to achieve robust activation ofsynthetic networks. Here we implement, characterize, and optimize a newoptogenetic tool in mammalian cells based on a previously published system inbacteria called Opto-T7RNAPs. The tool is orthogonal to the cellular machineryfor transcription and consists of a split T7 RNA polymerase coupled with the bluelight-inducible magnets system (mammalian OptoT7-mOptoT7). In our study weexploited the T7 polymerase's viral origins to tune our system's expressionlevel, reaching up to an almost 20-fold change activation over the dark control. mOptoT7 is used here to generate mRNA for protein expression, shRNA for proteininhibition, and Pepper aptamer for RNA visualization. Moreover, we show thatmOptoT7 can mitigate the gene expression burden when compared to anotheroptogenetic construct. These properties make mOptoT7 a powerful new tool to usewhen orthogonality and viral RNA species (that lack endogenous RNA modifications)are desired.

TI  - Enzyme-Catalyzed Spiroacetal Formation in Polyketide Antibiotic Biosynthesis.
LID - 10.1021/jacs.2c03313 [doi]
AB  - A key step in the biosynthesis of numerous polyketides is the stereospecificformation of a spiroacetal (spiroketal). We report here that spiroacetalformation in the biosynthesis of the macrocyclic polyketides ossamycin andoligomycin involves catalysis by a novel spiroacetal cyclase. OssO from theossamycin biosynthetic gene cluster (BGC) is homologous to OlmO, the product ofan unannotated gene from the oligomycin BGC. The deletion of olmO abolishedoligomycin production and led to the isolation of oligomycin-like metaboliteslacking the spiroacetal structure. Purified OlmO catalyzed complete conversion ofthe major metabolite into oligomycin C. Crystal structures of OssO and OlmOreveal an unusual 10-strand beta-barrel. Three conserved polar residues areclustered together in the beta-barrel cavity, and site-specific mutation of anyof these residues either abolished or substantially diminished OlmO activity,supporting a role for general acid/general base catalysis in spiroacetalformation.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in hospital healthcare workers in Western Switzerlandat the end of the second pandemic wave.
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.001558 [doi]
AB  - Introduction. In early January 2020, the pandemic of COVID-19 (coronavirusdisease 2019) rapidly spread from China and caused a worldwidepandemic.Hypothesis. Healthcare workers represent a high-risk group for acquiringCOVID-19 and for nosocomial transmission of severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).Aim. We aimed to investigate over a 1 year period, across twopandemic waves, the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in employees at a WesternSwitzerland public hospital.Methodology. A prospective observational SARS-CoV-2seroprevalence study was proposed to all hospital employees who enrolled on avoluntary basis.Results. Out of 594 participants recruited on a voluntary basis, 269 volunteers (45.3 %) had anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: this seroprevalence wastwice higher than that reported in the local community. Healthcare workers withprolonged exposure to patients with COVID-19 showed a significantly higher oddsratio (OR) of having a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology [OR 3.19, 95 % confidenceinterval (CI) 2.16-4.74]. Symptoms showing the highest association with apositive serology were anosmia (OR 11.9, 95 % CI 5.58-30.9) and ageusia (OR 10.3,95 % CI 4.8-26.3). A total of 17.1 % (95 % CI 12.2-21.1 %) of SARS-CoV-2seropositive volunteers did not report a suspicion of COVID-19 in their personal history.Conclusion. Overall, we observed that the impact of the second SARS-CoV-2pandemic wave was considerable and significantly affected healthcare workers withprolonged exposure to patients with COVID-19.

TI  - Variations in oral microbiome and its predictive functions between tumorous andhealthy individuals.
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.001568 [doi]
AB  - Introduction. The oral cavity is one of the largest reservoirs of microorganisms and many pathogenic bacteria have been shown to be associated with the aetiology of oral cancers.Gap Statement. Owing to the complexity of oral microbialcommunities and their unclear relationship with oral cancer, identification ofspecific bacteria which contribute to oral cancer is a key imperative.Aim. Tocompare and investigate the variations in the composition of the bacterialmicrobiome and its functions between patients with oral tumorous lesions andhealthy subjects.Methodology. Twenty-seven samples from individuals with oraltumours (five oral benign tumours and 22 oral squamous cell carcinomas) and 15samples from healthy subjects were collected. Genomic DNA was extracted and theV3-V5 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced. Subsequently, bioinformaticassessment was conducted using QIIME2, PICRUSt and linear discriminant analysiseffect size analyses (LEfSe).Results. The oral microbiota was composed mainly of the phyla Proteobacteria (31.76 %, 35.00 %), Bacteroidetes (30.13 %, 25.13 %) andFirmicutes (23.92 %, 17.07 %) in tumorous and healthy individuals, respectively. Neisseria, Prevotella, Fusobacterium, Streptococcus, Capnocytophaga, Veillonella,Haemophilus, Prevotella, Porphyromonas and Leptotrichia were the most abundantgenera. Alpha diversity in the tumour group was significantly greater than thatin the healthy group (P<0.05). Differential analysis of microbes between groupsdemonstrated a significantly higher number of Neisseria, Veillonella,Streptococcus, Leptotrichia, Lautropia, Sphingopyxis, Sphingobium, Tannerella,Actinomyces and Rothia in healthy controls compared with the tumour group.However, the genera Treponema, Micrococcus, Pseudomonas, Janthinobacterium,Parvimos, Loktanella, Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Catonella, Aggregatibacterand Propionibacterium were significantly higher in the tumour group. Pathwaysrelated to cancers, cell motility, environmental adaptation, metabolism andsignal transduction were enhanced in the tumour group, while functions associatedwith immune system diseases, replication, repair and translation weresignificantly enhanced in the healthy group.Conclusion. Variations in the oralmicrobiota and its functions showed a correlation with oral tumours. The tumourgroup showed an increased abundance of some multi-drug-resistant andperiodontitis-related pathogens. The significantly altered microbiotas may serve as potential biomarkers or inform combination therapy for oral tumours.

TI  - Space-Confined Synthesis of Thin Polypyrrole Nanosheets in Layered BismuthOxychloride for a Photoresponse Antibacterial within the Near-Infrared Window andAccelerated Wound Healing.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c11503 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial infection greatly affects the rate of wound healing. Both photothermal and photodynamic antibacterial therapies activated by near-infrared (NIR) lightwith semiconductor nanomedicine are two effective approaches to address bacterialinfections, but they cannot coexist synergistically to kill bacteria moreefficiently because of the limitation of the band structure. Here, inspired bythe natural core-shell structure and photosynthesis simultaneously, polypyrrole(PPy) is synthesized in the two-dimensional restricted area of the layeredbismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) nanosheets through the in situ ultrasonicrecombination method. The atomic-level interface contact and bonding formed inthe PPy-BiOCl intercalated nanosheets not only improve the light-to-heatconversion capabilities of PPy but also promote the transmission of PPyphotogenerated charge carriers to the BiOCl semiconductor. The nanocompositestake advantage of the deeper tissue penetration under NIR light irradiation andexhibit excellent photothermal and photodynamic synergistic antibacterialactivity. In addition, PPy-BiOCl intercalated nanosheets have goodbiocompatibility and accelerate wound healing through their antimicrobialactivity and skin repair function. The space-confined synthesis of thin PPynanosheets in layered structures offers an efficient NIR photoresponsivenanomedicine for the treatment of pathogen infection, with promising applicationsin infected wound healing.

TI  - Enhanced mitochondrial activity reshapes a gut microbiota profile that delaysNASH progression.
LID - 10.1002/hep.32705 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent studies suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction promotesprogression to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) by aggravating the gut-liver status. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Herein, wehypothesized that enhanced mitochondrial activity might reshape a specificmicrobiota signature that, when transferred to germ-free (GF) mice, could delayNASH progression. Design WT and methylation-controlled J protein knock-out(MCJ-KO) mice were fed for 6 weeks with either control or a choline-deficient,L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDA-HFD). One mouse of each group acted as adonor of caecal microbiota to GF mice, who also underwent the CDA-HFD model for 3weeks. Hepatic injury, intestinal barrier, gut microbiome and the associatedfaecal metabolome were then studied. RESULTS: Following 6 weeks of CDA-HFD, theabsence of MCJ, an inhibitor of mitochondrial complex I activity, reduced hepaticinjury and improved gut-liver axis in an aggressive NASH dietary model. Thiseffect was transferred to GF mice through caecal microbiota transplantation. Wesuggest that the specific microbiota profile of MCJ-KO, characterised by anincrease in the faecal relative abundance of Dorea and Oscillospira genera and a reduction in AF12, Allboaculum and [Ruminococcus], exerted protective actionsthrough enhancing short-chain fatty acids, NAD(+) metabolism and sirtuinactivity, subsequently increasing fatty acid oxidation in GF mice. Importantly,we identified Dorea genus as one of the main modulators of thismicrobiota-dependent protective phenotype. CONCLUSION: Overall, we provideevidence for the relevance of mitochondria-microbiota interplay during NASH, and that targeting it could be a valuable therapeutic approach.

TI  - Assessing Intermediate Formation and Electron Competition duringThiosulfate-Driven Denitrification: An Experimental and Modeling Study.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c03937 [doi]
AB  - There is increasing interest in thiosulfate-driven denitrification for low C/Nwastewater treatment, but the denitrification performance varies with thethiosulfate oxidation pathways. Models have been developed to predict theproducts of denitrification, but few consider thiosulfate reduction to elemental sulfur (S(0)), an undesirable reaction that can intensify electron competitionwith denitrifying enzymes. In this study, the model using indirect coupling ofelectrons (ICE) was developed to predict S(0) formation and electron competition during thiosulfate-driven denitrification. Kinetic data were obtained fromsulfur-oxidizing bacteria (SOB) dominated by the branched pathway and were usedto calibrate and validate the model. Electron competition was investigated under different operating conditions. Modeling results reveal that electrons producedin the first step of thiosulfate oxidation typically prioritize thiosulfatereduction, then nitrate reduction, and finally nitrite reduction. However, theelectron consumption rate for S(0) formation decreases sharply with the declineof thiosulfate concentration. Thus, a continuous feeding strategy was effectivein alleviating the competition between thiosulfate reduction and denitrifyingenzymes. Electron competition leads to nitrite accumulation, which could be areliable substrate for anammox. The model was further evaluated with anammoxintegration. Results suggested that the branched pathway and continuous supply ofthiosulfate are favorable to create a symbiotic relationship between SOB andanammox.

TI  - High-Efficiency Photodynamic Antibacterial Activity of NH2-MIL-101(Fe)@MoS2/ZnOTernary Composites.
LID - 10.1021/acsabm.2c00439 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial infections are a serious threat to human health, and the development ofeffective antibacterial agents represents a critical solution. In this study,NH2-MIL-101(Fe)@MoS2/ZnO ternary nanocomposites are successfully prepared by afacile wet-chemistry procedure, where MoS2 nanosheets are grown onto the MIL-101 scaffold forming a flower-like morphology with ZnO nanoparticles deposited ontothe surface. The ternary composites exhibit a remarkable sterilizationperformance under visible light irradiation toward both Gram-negative andGram-positive bacteria, eliminating 98.6% of Escherichia coli and 90% ofStaphylococcus aureus after exposure to visible light for 30 min, a performancemarkedly better than that with NH2-MIL-101(Fe)@MoS2 binary composites and evenmore so than MoS2 nanosheets alone. This is ascribed to the unique electronicband structure of the composites, where the separation of the photogeneratedcarriers is likely facilitated by the S-scheme mechanism in theNH2-MIL-101(Fe)@MoS2 binary composites and further enhanced by the formation of ap-n heterojunction between MoS2 and ZnO in the ternary composites. Thisinterfacial charge transfer boosts the effective production of superoxideradicals by the reduction of oxygen, and the disproportionation reaction withwater leads to the formation of hydroxy radicals, as attested in spectroscopicand microscopic measurements. Results from this study highlight the significance of structural engineering of nanocomposites in the manipulation of the electronicband structure and hence the photodynamic activity.

TI  - Bacterial Growth-Induced Tobramycin Smart Release Self-Healing Hydrogel forPseudomonas aeruginosa-Infected Burn Wound Healing.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c05557 [doi]
AB  - Burns are a common health problem worldwide and are highly susceptible tobacterial infections that are difficult to handle with ordinary wound dressings. Therefore, burn wound repair is extremely challenging in clinical practice.Herein, a series of self-healing hydrogels (QCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA) with goodelectrical conductivity and antioxidant activity were prepared on the basis ofquaternized chitosan (QCS), oxidized dextran (OD), tobramycin (TOB), andpolydopamine-coated polypyrrole nanowires (PPY@PDA NWs). These Schiff basecross-links between the aminoglycoside antibiotic TOB and OD enable TOB to beslowly released and responsive to pH. Interestingly, the acidic substances duringthe bacteria growth process can induce the on-demand release of TOB, avoiding theabuse of antibiotics. The antibacterial results showed that theQCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA9 hydrogel could kill high concentrations of Pseudomonasaeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli in a short time and showed a bactericidal effect for up to 11 days in an agar plate diffusionexperiment, while showing good in vivo antibacterial activity. Excellent andlong-lasting antibacterial properties make it suitable for severely infectedwounds. Furthermore, the incorporation of PPY@PDA endowed the hydrogel withnear-infrared (NIR) irradiation assisted bactericidal activity of drug-resistant bacteria, conductivity, and antioxidant activity. Most importantly, in thePA-infected burn wound model, the QCS/OD/TOB/PPY@PDA9 hydrogel more effectivelycontrolled wound inflammation levels and promoted collagen deposition, vasculargeneration, and earlier wound closure compared to Tegaderm dressings. Therefore, the TOB smart release hydrogels with on-demand delivery are extremelyadvantageous for bacterial-infected burn wound healing.

TI  - Epidemiological Comparison of Four COVID-19 Waves in the Democratic Republic ofthe Congo, March 2020-January 2022.
LID - 10.1007/s44197-022-00052-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Nationwide analyses are required to optimise and tailor activities tocontrol future COVID-19 waves of resurgence continent-wide. We comparedepidemiological and clinical outcomes of the four COVID-19 waves in theDemocratic Republic of Congo (DRC). METHODS: This retrospective descriptiveepidemiological analysis included data from the national line list of confirmedCOVID-19 cases in all provinces for all waves between 9 March 2020 and 2 January 2022. Descriptive statistical measures (frequencies, percentages, case fatalityrates [CFR], test positivity rates [TPR], and characteristics) were comparedusing chi-squared or the Fisher-Irwin test. RESULTS: During the study period,72,108/445,084 (16.2%) tests were positive, with 9,641/56,637 (17.0%),16,643/66,560 (25.0%), 24,172/157,945 (15.3%), and 21,652/163,942 (13.2%) casesduring the first, second, third, and fourth waves, respectively. TPRsignificantly decreased from 17.0% in the first wave to 13.2% in the fourth wave as did infection of frontline health workers (5.2% vs. 0.9%). CFR decreased from 5.1 to 0.9% from the first to fourth wave. No sex- or age-related differences in distributions across different waves were observed. The majority of cases wereasymptomatic in the first (73.1%) and second (86.6%) waves, in contrast to thatin the third (11.1%) and fourth (31.3%) waves. CONCLUSION: Despite fewer reportedcases, the primary waves (first and second) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the DRCwere more severe than the third and fourth waves, with each wave being associatedwith a new SARS-CoV-2 variant. Tailored public health and social measures, andresurgence monitoring are needed to control future waves of COVID-19.

TI  - Cold-adapted strains as plant growth-promoting bacteria on soybean seeds andbiocontrol agents against Macrophomina phaseolina.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15759 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To characterise cold-adapted bacteria by testing their PGP features andantagonistic activity against Macrophomina phaseolina, both in vitro and coating soybean seeds (Glycine max (L.) Merr.). METHODS AND RESULTS: Burkholderiagladioli MB39, Serratia proteamaculans 136 and Serratia proteamaculans 137 wereevaluated. In vitro tests showed that S. proteamaculans 136 and 137 producesiderophore and indole-acetic acid (IAA), solubilise phosphate and fix nitrogen. Additionally, B. gladioli MB39 and S. proteamaculans 137 showed hydrolaseactivity and potent antifungal effects. The biocontrol efficacy over soybeanseeds was evaluated using in vitro and green-house methods by immersing seedsinto each bacterial suspension. As a result, S. proteamaculans 136 has improvedthe performance in all the seed-germination evaluated parameters. In addition, S.proteamaculans 137 and B. gladioli MB39 strongly inhibited M. phaseolina,reducing the infection index values to 10% and 0%, respectively. CONCLUSION:Serratia proteamaculans 136, 137 and Burkholderia gladioli MB39 showed plantgrowth promotion features and inhibition of Macrophomina phaseolina infection by producing different antifungal compounds. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY:Our results reinforce the application of cold-adapted Serratia proteamaculans andBurkholderia gladioli bacterial strains as candidates for developing microbialformulation to promote plant growth and guarantee antifungal protection insoybean crops.

TI  - Exploration of Novel Lichen Compounds as Inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro:Ligand-Based Design, Molecular Dynamics, and ADMET Analyses.
LID - 10.1007/s12010-022-04103-3 [doi]
AB  - In the year 2019-2020, the whole world witnessed the spread of a disease calledCOVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2. A number of effective drugs and vaccine has beenformulated to combat this outbreak. For the development of anti-COVID-19 drugs,the main protease (Mpro) is considered a key target as it has rare mutations and plays a crucial role in the replication of the SARS CoV-2. In this study, alibrary of selected lichen compounds was prepared and used for virtual screening against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro using molecular docking, and several hits as potentialinhibitors were identified. Remdesivir was used as a standard inhibitor of Mprofor its comparison with the identified hits. Twenty-six compounds were identifiedas potential hits against Mpro, and these were subjected to in silico ADMETproperty prediction, and the compounds having favorable properties were selected for further analysis. After manual inspection of their interaction with thebinding pocket of Mpro and binding affinity score, four compounds, namely,variolaric acid, cryptostictinolide, gyrophoric acid, and usnic acid, wereselected for molecular dynamics study to evaluate the stability of complex. Themolecular dynamics results indicated that except cryptostictinolide, all thethree compounds made a stable complex with Mpro throughout a 100-ns simulationtime period. Among all, usnic acid seems to be more stable and effective against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. In summary, our findings suggest that usnic acid, variolaricacid, and gyrophoric acid have potential to inhibit SARS-Cov-2 Mpro and act as a lead compounds for the development of antiviral drug candidates againstSARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Endophytic bacteria overlay significant role in plant growthpromotion, eliminating phyto-pathogens and combating stress-conditions. In thepresent study, we aimed to screen high salt tolerant bacteria and study theiradaptive response to elevated salt concentrations. A total of 46 endophyticbacterial isolates from Vigna radiata were screened for salt tolerance. The high salt tolerant endophytic isolate was characterized for alteration in morphology, growth rate, protein profiling, and compatible solute concentrations. RESULTS:The isolate MHN12, based upon biochemical characterization and partial 16S rDNAsequencing identified as B. licheniformis (accession number MG273753) was able totolerate up to 15% NaCl (Sodium Chloride) (2.6 M) concentration. The isolatepossessed 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (ACCD) activity alongwith indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophore, ammonia, organic acid and hydrogencyanide (HCN) production. Accumulation of proline was apparent up to 7.5% NaClconcentration and declined afterwards. Ultrastructure analysis using TEM(transmission electron microscopy) revealed the morphological alteration fromrods to filaments. CONCLUSION: Acclimatization to salt stress and plant growthpromoting activities could contribute to utilization of this bacterium asbioinoculant to enhance the crop yield and discourage the application of chemicalfertilizers.

TI  - Vibrio tetraodonis subsp. pristinus subsp. nov., isolated from the coral Acroporacytherea at Palmyra Atoll, and creation and emended description of Vibriotetraodonis subsp. tetraodonis subsp. nov.
LID - 10.1007/s10482-022-01766-0 [doi]
AB  - Strain OCN044(T) was isolated from the homogenised tissue and mucus of anapparently healthy Acropora cytherea coral fragment collected from the westernreef terrace of Palmyra Atoll in the Northern Line Islands and was taxonomically evaluated with a polyphasic approach. The morphological and chemotaxonomicproperties are consistent with characteristics of the genus Vibrio:Gram-stain-negative rods, oxidase- and catalase-positive, and motile by means of a polar flagellum. Strain OCN044(T) can be differentiated as a novel subspeciesbased on 21 differences among chemotaxonomic features (e.g., fatty acidspercentages for C12:0 and C18:1 omega7c), enzymatic activities (e.g., DNase andcystine arylamidase), and carbon sources utilized (e.g., L-xylose andD-melezitose) from its nearest genetic relative. Phylogenetic analysis andgenomic comparisons show close evolutionary relatedness to Vibrio tetraodonisA511(T) but the overall genomic relatedness indices identify strain OCN044(T) as a distinct subspecies. Based on a polyphasic characterisation, differences ingenomic and taxonomic data, strain OCN044(T) represents a novel subspecies of V. tetraodonis A511(T), for which the name Vibrio tetraodonis subsp. pristinussubsp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is OCN044(T) (= LMG 31895(T) = DSM111778(T)).

TI  - Complete genome sequence of virulent genotype I African swine fever virus strain K49 from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, isolated from a domestic pig (Sus scrofa domesticus).
LID - 10.1007/s00705-022-05543-2 [doi]
AB  - African swine fever is one of the most feared infectious diseases in the pigindustry. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an enveloped, cytoplasmicdouble-stranded DNA virus and the only member of the family Asfarviridae.Although ASFV is known to have been circulating on the African continent since atleast 1921, little is known about the genetic characteristics of historical ASFV strains isolated in sub-Saharan Africa. The few complete ASFV genome sequencesobtained from African historical isolates have demonstrated genetic diversity,but the available data are limited and insufficient for fully understanding themolecular evolution and continental spread of ASFV. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the virulent ASFV strain K49, collected during an outbreak in the Belgian Congo (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo) in 1949. Thecomplete genome sequence of ASFV strain K49 was determined using an IlluminaHiSeq platform and is 189,523 bp in length with a mean GC content of 38.43%, with189 genes annotated. This is the first reported complete genome sequence of anASFV serogroup 2 isolate. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated genetic divergencewithin genotype I, and strain K49 formed a separate branch from other ASFVgenotype I isolates.

TI  - Microbial Response to Increased Temperatures Within a Lava-Induced HydrothermalSystem in Iceland: An Analogue for the Habitability of Volcanic Terrains on Mars.
LID - 10.1089/ast.2021.0124 [doi]
AB  - Fossil hydrothermal systems on Mars are important exploration targets becausethey may have once been habitable and could still preserve evidence of microbial life. We investigated microbial communities within an active lava-inducedhydrothermal system associated with the 2014-2015 eruption of Holuhraun inIceland as a Mars analogue. In 2016, the microbial composition in the lava-heatedwater differed substantially from that of the glacial river and spring watersources that fed into the system. Several taxonomic and metabolic groups wereconfined to the water emerging from the lava and some showed the highest sequencesimilarities to subsurface ecosystems, including to the predicted thermophilicand deeply branching Candidatus Acetothermum autotrophicum. Measurements showthat the communities were affected by temperature and other environmentalfactors. In particular, comparing glacial river water incubated in situ (5.7degrees C, control) with glacial water incubated within a lava-heated stream(17.5 degrees C, warm) showed that microbial abundance, richness, and diversityincreased in the warm treatment compared with the control, with the predictedmajor metabolism shifting from lithotrophy toward organotrophy and possiblyphototrophy. In addition, thermophilic bacteria isolated from the lava-heatedwater and a nearby acidic hydrothermal system included the knownendospore-formers Geobacillus stearothermophilus and Paenibacillus cisolokensisas well as a potentially novel taxon within the order Hyphomicrobiales. Similarlava-water interactions on Mars could therefore have generated habitableenvironments for microbial communities.

TI  - Early-onset fulminant neonatal sepsis caused by Multi-Drug Resistant and ESBLproducing E. coli (CTX-M gene) in a late-preterm neonate: case report andliterature review.
PG  - 223-226
AB  - Neonatal sepsis is a systemic condition characterized by haemodynamic changes andother clinical manifestations due to a presence of pathogenic microorganisms(bacteria, viruses, or fungi) in nor- mally sterile fluid that occurs in aninfant younger than 90 days old. Neonatal sepsis may be divided into two types:early-onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) and late-onset neonatal sepsis (LOS).Gram-posi- tive microorganisms are the etiological agents in 62% of EOS, and in43% of the total the identified microorganism is GBS. Gram-negativemicroorganisms comprise 37% of the etiological agents of EOS, of which 29% arecaused by Escherichia coli. ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae represent a majorworldwide threat among drug-resistant bacteria in both hospital and communitysettings. ESBLs are often located on large plasmids that also harbour genesresistant to other antimicrobial classes, resulting in multidrug-resistantisolates. Plasmid-encoded ESBLs of the CTX-M-type are increasingly reportedworldwide in Gram-negative rods and now account for most of the ESBLs found inEnterobacteriaceae. We present one case of EOS by Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) and ESBL producing E. coli (CTX-M gene) in a neonate born to a mother recentlyimmigrated from Africa. Maternal blood culture grew the same bacteria.

TI  - Identification of a novel mutation involved in colistin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) based approaches.
PG  - 199-209
AB  - The spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producingbacteria (KPC) is one of the most serious threats to global public health. Due tothe limited antibiotic options, colis- tin often represents a therapeutic choice.In this study, we performed Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) by Illumina andNanopore platforms on four colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates (CoRKp) toexplore the resistance profile and the mutations involved in colistin resistance.Mapping reads with reference sequence of the most com- mon genes involved incolistin resistance did not show the presence of mobile colistin resistance (mcr)genes in all CoRKp. Complete or partial deletions of mgrB gene were observed inthree out of four CoRKp, while in one CoRKp the mutation V24G on phoQ wasidentified. Complementation assay with proper wild type genes restored colistinsusceptibility, validating the role of the amino acid substitution V24G and, asalready described in the literature, confirming the key role of mgrB alterations in colistin resistance. In conclusion, this study allowed the identification ofthe novel mutation on phoQ gene involved in colistin resistance phenotype.

LID - e78129 [pii]
AB  - Biogeographical studies have traditionally focused on readily visible organisms, but recent technological advances are enabling analyses of the large-scaledistribution of microscopic organisms, whose biogeographical patterns have longbeen debated. Here we assessed the global structure of plankton geography and itsrelation to the biological, chemical, and physical context of the ocean (the'seascape') by analyzing metagenomes of plankton communities sampled acrossoceans during the Tara Oceans expedition, in light of environmental data andocean current transport. Using a consistent approach across organismal sizes thatprovides unprecedented resolution to measure changes in genomic compositionbetween communities, we report a pan-ocean, size-dependent plankton biogeography overlying regional heterogeneity. We found robust evidence for a basin-scaleimpact of transport by ocean currents on plankton biogeography, and on acharacteristic timescale of community dynamics going beyond simple seasonality orlife history transitions of plankton.

OAB - Oceans are brimming with life invisible to our eyes, a myriad of species ofbacteria, viruses and other microscopic organisms essential for the health of theplanet. These 'marine plankton' are unable to swim against currents and shouldtherefore be constantly on the move, yet previous studies have suggested thatdistinct species of plankton may in fact inhabit different oceanic regions.However, proving this theory has been challenging; collecting plankton islogistically difficult, and it is often impossible to distinguish between speciessimply by examining them under a microscope. However, within the last decade, aresearch schooner called Tara has travelled the globe to gather thousands ofplankton samples. At the same time, advances in genomics have made it possible toidentify species based only on fragments of their DNA sequence. To understand thehidden geography of plankton communities in Earth's oceans, Richter et al. pored over DNA from the Tara Oceans expedition. This revealed that, despite beingunable to resist the flow of water, various planktonic species which live closeto the surface manage to occupy distinct, stable provinces shaped by currents.Different sizes of plankton are distributed in different sized provinces, withthe smallest organisms tending to inhabit the smallest areas. Comparing DNAsimilarities and speeds of currents at the ocean surface revealed how these mightstretch and mix plankton communities. Plankton play a critical role in the healthof the ocean and the chemical cycles of planet Earth. These results could allowdeeper investigation by marine modellers, ecologists, and evolutionarybiologists. Meanwhile, work is already underway to investigate how climate changemight impact this hidden geography.

TI  - The inhibitory effect of paeoniflorin on reactive oxygen species alleviates theactivation of NF-kappaB and MAPK signalling pathways in macrophages.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001210 [doi]
AB  - Paeoniflorin (PF) has been proven to possess a protective effect in someinflammatory diseases, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Macrophages play central roles in inflammatory responses and LPS-stimulated RAW264.7macrophage is an ideal model for studying the anti-inflammatory effects andmechanisms of drugs. Thus, it was used to explore the anti-inflammatory mechanismof PF in this study. The results showed that PF markedly attenuated theactivation of NF-kappaB, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38mitogen activated protein kinase (p38) signalling pathways induced by LPSexposure. In addition, PF pretreatment dose-dependently suppressed the productionof cytokines and the expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitricoxide synthase (iNOS). Concomitantly, PF pretreatment dramatically inhibited the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) without affecting thephagocytosis of macrophages. Furthermore, it has proved the scavenging effect of PF on ROS was involved in the anti-inflammatory process. This study provides anovel aspect to the understanding of the anti-inflammatory mechanism of PF.

TI  - Direct visualization of sequence-specific DNA binding by gonococcal type IV pili.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001224 [doi]
AB  - Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhoea, is a major burden onglobal healthcare systems, with an estimated ~80-90 million new global casesannually. This burden is exacerbated by increasing levels of antimicrobialresistance, which has greatly limited viable antimicrobial therapies. Decreasing gonococcal drug susceptibility has been driven largely by accumulation ofchromosomal resistance determinants, which can be acquired through naturaltransformation, whereby DNA in the extracellular milieu is imported into cellsand incorporated into the genome by homologous recombination. N. gonorrhoeaepossesses a specialized system for DNA uptake, which strongly biasestransformation in favour of DNA from closely related bacteria by recognizing a10-12 bp DNA uptake sequence (DUS) motif, which is highly overrepresented intheir chromosomal DNA. This process relies on numerous proteins, including theDUS-specific receptor ComP, which assemble retractile protein filaments termedtype IV pili (T4P) extending from the cell surface, and one model for neisserial DNA uptake proposes that these filaments bind DNA in a DUS-dependent mannerbefore retracting to transport DNA into the periplasm. However, conflictingevidence indicates that elongated pilus filaments may not have such a direct rolein DNA binding uptake as this model suggests. Here, we quantitatively measuredDNA binding to gonococcal T4P fibres by directly visualizing binding complexeswith confocal fluorescence microscopy in order to confirm the sequence-specific, comP-dependent DNA binding capacity of elongated T4P fibres. This supports theidea that pilus filaments could be responsible for initially capturing DNA in thefirst step of sequence-specific DNA uptake.

TI  - Screening of osmotic stress-tolerant bacteria for plant growth promotion in wheat(Triticum aestivum L.) and brinjal (Solanum melongena L.) under droughtconditions.
LID - 10.1111/lam.13797 [doi]
AB  - Drought stress adversely affects plant growth and productivity. Therefore, theapplication of plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) is a viable option forcombating drought resistance in crops. In this study, 144 bacteria were isolated from the Kutch desert soil in Gujarat. Based on osmotic stress tolerance and PGP properties, two strains, Bacillus tequilensis (KS5B) and Pseudomonas stutzeri(KS5C) were tested for their effect on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and brinjal(Solanum melongena L.) under drought stress conditions. Inoculation with osmotic stress-tolerant bacteria showed 15.15-29.27% enhancement in root length of wheat and 15.27-32.59% in brinjal plants. Similarly, the enhancement of shoot lengthranged from 14.72-37.70% for wheat and 59.39-95.94% for brinjal plants.Furthermore, the inoculated plants showed significant improvement in chlorophyll content and antioxidant properties such as proline, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase activity compared the control. Therefore, the bacterial strainsidentified in this study can be used to mitigate drought stress and enhance plantbiomass.

TI  - Streptococcus agalactiae imports spermidine by a member of the aminoacid/polyamine antiporter family to endure citric acid stress at the vaginal pH.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001219 [doi]
AB  - Polyamines bind to various cellular components, such as nucleic acids,phospholipids, proteins and nucleotides. They are involved in the virulence andprotection against physiological stresses of several bacterial species.Streptococcus agalactiae is able to colonize the vaginal tract of asymptomaticpregnant women and to resist, by an as yet poorly characterized mechanism, pH4.0, the low physiological pH of this environment. We identified a transporter ofthe amino acid/polyamine antiporter family (SAK_1604 in strain A909) that shares 39.8 % similar amino acids with CadB and 34.7 % with PotE, two transportersimplicated in acid resistance in Escherichia coli. We found that sak_1604 isoverexpressed in the presence of spermidine and during citric acid stress at the vaginal pH, but not during lactic acid or HCl stresses at the same pH or during asodium citrate stress at pH 7.4. Dihydrogen citrate is the predominant form ofcitric acid at pH 4.0. Using a deletion mutant, we proved that SAK_1604 isinvolved in the survival of S. agalactiae during citric acid stress at pH 4.0 in the presence of spermidine, and we showed by TLC analysis that it is involved in spermidine transport in these conditions. Our data open new perspectives on thecomprehension of the molecular mechanisms allowing S. agalactiae to survive atthe physiological pH of the vagina and on the unsuspected role of an ionic formof citric acid.

TI  - Identification of bacteriophage genome sequences with representation learning.
LID - btac509 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bioinformatics/btac509 [doi]
AB  - MOTIVATION: Bacteriophages/Phages are the viruses that infect and replicatewithin bacteria and archaea. Phages are used to therapeutically provide anotherpotential solution for solving antibiotic resistance, which is one of the threatsto global health. To develop phage therapies, the identification of phages frommetagenome sequences is the first step. Currently, there are two main methods foridentifying phages: database-based (alignment-based) methods and alignment-freemethods. Database-based methods typically use a large number of sequences asreferences; alignment-free methods usually learn the features of the sequenceswith machine learning and deep learning models. RESULTS: We propose INHERIT whichuse a deep representation learning model to integrate both database-based andalignment-free methods, combining the strengths of both. Pre-training is used as an alternative way of acquiring knowledge representations from existingdatabases, while the BERT-style deep learning framework retains the advantage of alignment-free methods. We compare INHERIT with four existing methods on athird-party benchmark dataset. Our experiments show that INHERIT achieves abetter performance with the F1-score of 0.9932. In addition, we find thatpre-training two species separately helps the non-alignment deep learning modelmake more accurate predictions. AVAILABILITY: The codes of INHERIT are nowavailable in: https://github.com/Celestial-Bai/INHERIT. SUPPLEMENTARYINFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

TI  - Allele-specific alternative splicing of Drosophila Ribosomal protein S21suppresses a lethal mutation in the Phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export (Phax) gene.
LID - jkac195 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/g3journal/jkac195 [doi]
AB  - Genetic disruptions to the biogenesis of spliceosomal small nuclearribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) in Drosophila cause wide-spread alternative splicing changes, including changes to the splicing of pre-mRNA for Ribosomal protein S21 (RpS21). Using a transposon mutant for the Phosphorylated adaptor for RNA export (Phax) gene, we demonstrate that changes in the splicing of RpS21 transcriptshave a strong influence on the developmental progression of PhaxSH/SH mutants.Different alleles of the Drosophila RpS21 gene are circulating in commonlaboratory strains and cell lines. These alleles exhibit differences in RpS21intron retention and splicing efficiency. Differences in the splicing of RpS21transcripts accounts for prior conflicting observations of the phenotypicseverity of PhaxSH/SH mutant stocks. The alleles uncover a strong splicingenhancer in RpS21 transcripts that can fully suppress the larval lethality andpartially suppress the pupal lethality exhibited by PhaxSH/SH mutant lines. Inthe absence of the splicing enhancer, the splicing of RpS21 transcripts can bemodulated in trans by the SR-rich B52 splicing factor. As PhaxSH/SH mutantsexhibit wide-spread splicing changes in transcripts for other genes, findingshere establish the importance of a single alternative splicing event, RpS21splicing or intron retention, to the developmental progression of Drosophila.

TI  - The Two Acyl Carrier Proteins of Enterococcus faecalis Have NonredundantFunctions.
PG  - e0020222
LID - 10.1128/jb.00202-22 [doi]
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis encodes two proteins, AcpA and AcpB, having thecharacteristics of acyl carrier proteins (ACPs). We report that the acpA genelocated in the fatty acid synthesis operon is essential for fatty acid synthesis and the DeltaacpA strain requires unsaturated fatty acids for growth. TheDeltaacpA strain could be complemented by a plasmid carrying a wild-type acpAgene, but not by a plasmid carrying a wild-type acpB gene. Substitution of fourAcpA residues for those of AcpB resulted in a protein that modestly complemented the DeltaacpA strain and restored fatty acid synthesis, although the acyl chains synthesized were unusually short. IMPORTANCE Enterococcus faecalis, as well asrelated species, has two genes-acpA and acpB-encoding putative acyl carrierproteins (ACPs). It has been assumed that AcpA is essential for fatty acidsynthesis whereas AcpB is involved utilization of environmental fatty acids. Wereport here the first experimental test of the essentiality of acpA and show thatit is indeed an essential gene that cannot be replaced by acpB.

TI  - Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Taniborbactam (VNRX-5133) with Cefepime inSubjects with Various Degrees of Renal Impairment.
PG  - e0025322
LID - 10.1128/aac.00253-22 [doi]
AB  - Taniborbactam, an investigational beta-lactamase inhibitor that is active againstboth serine- and metallo-beta-lactamases, is being developed in combination with cefepime to treat serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Anticipating the use of cefepime-taniborbactam in patients withimpaired renal function, an open-label, single-dose clinical study was performed to examine the pharmacokinetics of both drugs in subjects with various degrees ofrenal function. Hemodialysis-dependent subjects were also studied to examine the amounts of cefepime and taniborbactam dialyzed. Single intravenous infusions of 2g cefepime and 0.5 g taniborbactam coadministered over 2 h were examined, withhemodialysis-dependent subjects receiving doses both on- and off-dialysis. Nosubjects experienced serious adverse events or discontinued treatment due toadverse events. The majority of adverse events observed were mild in severity,and there were no trends in the safety of cefepime-taniborbactam related todeclining renal function or the timing of hemodialysis. Clinically significantand similar decreases in drug clearance with declining renal function wereobserved for both cefepime and taniborbactam. The respective decreases ingeometric mean clearance for subjects with mild, moderate, and severe renalimpairment compared to subjects with normal renal function were 18%, 63%, and 78%for cefepime and 15%, 63%, and 81% for taniborbactam, respectively. Decreases in clearance were similar for both drugs and were shown to be proportional todecreases in renal function. Both cefepime and taniborbactam were dialyzable,with similar amounts removed during 4 h of hemodialysis. This study is registeredat ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03690362.

TI  - Passive Immunization with a Single Monoclonal Neutralizing Antibody Protectsagainst Cutaneous and Mucosal Mouse Papillomavirus Infections.
PG  - e0070322
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00703-22 [doi]
AB  - We have established a mouse papillomavirus (MmuPV1) model that induces bothcutaneous and mucosal infections and cancers. In the current study, we use thismodel to test our hypothesis that passive immunization using a singleneutralizing monoclonal antibody can protect both cutaneous and mucosal sites at different time points after viral inoculation. We conducted a series ofexperiments involving the administration of either a neutralizing monoclonalantibody, MPV.A4, or control monoclonal antibodies to both outbred and inbredathymic mice. Three clinically relevant mucosal sites (lower genital tract forfemales and anus and tongue for both males and females) and two cutaneous sites(muzzle and tail) were tested. At the termination of the experiments, all tested tissues were harvested for virological analyses. Significantly lower levels ofviral signals were detected in the MPV.A4-treated female mice up to 6 hpost-viral inoculation compared to those in the isotype control. Interestingly,males displayed partial protection when they received MPV.A4 at the time of viralinoculation, even though they were completely protected when receiving MPV.A4 at 24 h before viral inoculation. We detected MPV.A4 in the blood starting at 1 hand up to 8 weeks postadministration in some mice. Parallel to these in vivostudies, we conducted in vitro neutralization using a mouse keratinocyte cellline and observed complete neutralization up to 8 h post-viral inoculation. Thus,passive immunization with a monoclonal neutralizing antibody can protect against papillomavirus infection at both cutaneous and mucosal sites and is timedependent. IMPORTANCE This is the first study testing a single monoclonalneutralizing antibody (MPV.A4) by passive immunization against papillomavirusinfections at both cutaneous and mucosal sites in the same host in the mousepapillomavirus model. We demonstrated that MPV.A4 administered before viralinoculation can protect both male and female athymic mice against MmuPV1infections at cutaneous and mucosal sites. MPV.A4 also offers partial protection at 6 h post-viral inoculation in female mice. MPV.A4 can be detected in the bloodfrom 1 h to 8 weeks after intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. Interestingly, males were only partially protected when they received MPV.A4 at the time of viralinoculation. The failed protection in males was due to the absence ofneutralizing MPV.A4 at the infected sites. Our findings suggest passiveimmunization with a single monoclonal neutralizing antibody can protect againstdiverse papillomavirus infections in a time-dependent manner in mice.

TI  - Phage Resistance Accompanies Reduced Fitness of Uropathogenic Escherichia coli inthe Urinary Environment.

LID - 10.1128/msphere.00345-22 [doi]
AB  - Urinary tract infection (UTI) is among the most common infections treatedworldwide each year and is caused primarily by uropathogenic Escherichia coli(UPEC). Rising rates of antibiotic resistance among uropathogens have spurred aconsideration of alternative treatment strategies, such as bacteriophage (phage) therapy; however, phage-bacterial interactions within the urinary environment arepoorly defined. Here, we assess the activity of two phages, namely, HP3 and ES17,against clinical UPEC isolates using in vitro and in vivo models of UTI. In both bacteriologic medium and pooled human urine, we identified phage resistancearising within the first 6 to 8 h of coincubation. Whole-genome sequencingrevealed that UPEC strains resistant to HP3 and ES17 harbored mutations in genes involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis. Phage-resistant strainsdisplayed several in vitro phenotypes, including alterations to adherence to and invasion of human bladder epithelial HTB-9 cells and increased biofilm formation in some isolates. Interestingly, these phage-resistant UPEC isolates demonstratedreduced growth in pooled human urine, which could be partially rescued bynutrient supplementation and were more sensitive to several outermembrane-targeting antibiotics than parental strains. Additionally,phage-resistant UPEC isolates were attenuated in bladder colonization in a murineUTI model. In total, our findings suggest that while resistance to phages, suchas HP3 and ES17, may arise readily in the urinary environment, phage resistanceis accompanied by fitness costs which may render UPEC more susceptible to hostimmunity or antibiotics. IMPORTANCE UTI is one of the most common causes ofoutpatient antibiotic use, and rising antibiotic resistance threatens the abilityto control UTI unless alternative treatments are developed. Bacteriophage (phage)therapy is gaining renewed interest; however, much like with antibiotics,bacteria can readily become resistant to phages. For successful UTI treatment, wemust predict how bacteria will evade killing by phage and identify the downstreamconsequences of phage resistance during bacterial infection. In our currentstudy, we found that while phage-resistant bacteria quickly emerged in vitro,these bacteria were less capable of growing in human urine and colonizing themurine bladder. These results suggest that phage therapy poses a viable UTItreatment if phage resistance confers fitness costs for the uropathogen. Theseresults have implications for developing cocktails of phage with multipledifferent bacterial targets, of which each is evaded only at the cost ofbacterial fitness.

AB  - Natural and human-made disasters can cause tremendous physical damage, societalchange, and suffering. In addition to their effects on people, disasters havebeen shown to alter the microbial population in the area affected. Alterationsfor microbial populations can lead to new ecological interactions, withadditional potentially adverse consequences for many species, including humans.Disaster-related stressors can be powerful forces for microbial selection.Studying microbial adaptation in disaster sites can reveal new biologicalprocesses, including mechanisms by which some microbes could become pathogenicand others could become beneficial (e.g., used for bioremediation). Here wesurvey examples of how disasters have affected microbiology and suggest that the topic of "disaster microbiology" is itself a new field of study. Given theaccelerating pace of human-caused climate change and the increasing encroachment of the natural word by human activities, it is likely that this area of research will become increasingly relevant to the broader field of microbiology. Sincedisaster microbiology is a broad term open to interpretation, we propose criteriafor what phenomena fall under its scope. The basic premise is that there must be a disaster that causes a change in the environment, which then causes analteration to microbes (either a physical or biological adaptation), and thatthis adaptation must have additional ramifications.

TI  - Synthetic Genetic Interactions Reveal a Dense and Cryptic Regulatory Network ofSmall Noncoding RNAs in Escherichia coli.
PG  - e0122522
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01225-22 [doi]
AB  - Over the past 20 years, we have learned that bacterial small noncoding RNAs(sRNAs) can rapidly effect changes in gene expression in response to stress.However, the broader role and impact of sRNA-mediated regulation in promotingbacterial survival has remained elusive. Indeed, there are few examples wheredisruption of sRNA-mediated gene regulation results in a discernible change inbacterial growth or survival. The lack of phenotypes attributable to loss of sRNAfunction suggests that either sRNAs are wholly dispensable or functionalredundancies mask the impact of deleting a single sRNA. We investigated syntheticgenetic interactions among sRNA genes in Escherichia coli by constructingpairwise deletions in 54 genes, including 52 sRNAs. Some 1,373 double deletionstrains were studied for growth defects under 32 different nutrient stressconditions and revealed 1,131 genetic interactions. In one example, we identifieda profound synthetic lethal interaction between ArcZ and CsrC when E. coli wasgrown on pyruvate, lactate, oxaloacetate, or d-/l-alanine, and we provideevidence that the expression of ppsA is dysregulated in the double deletionbackground, causing the conditionally lethal phenotype. This work employs aunique platform for studying sRNA-mediated gene regulation and sheds new light onthe genetic network of sRNAs that underpins bacterial growth. IMPORTANCE sRNAshave long been purported to be a critical mechanism by which bacteria respond to stress; however, uncovering growth phenotypes for sRNA deletion strains in E.coli and related bacteria has proven particularly challenging. In contrast, thedeletion of hfq, a chaperone required for the activity of many sRNAs in E. coli, results in striking growth defects in E. coli under a variety of mediumconditions and chemical stressors. Here, we examined the importance of hfq andsRNA deletion strains for E. coli growth in nutrient-limited medium supplemented with 30 different carbon sources. We then systematically combined sRNA deletionmutations, creating a library of 1,373 sRNA double deletion strains, which wescreened for growth under the same conditions, yielding 43,936 individual growth measurements. Our data uncovered more than 1,000 growth phenotypes for sRNAdouble deletion strains, shedding light on complicated networks of sRNAregulation that underpin bacterial survival under nutrient stress.

LID - 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.2c00299 [doi]
AB  - The WHO estimates an average of 10 million deaths per year due to the increasing number of infections and the predominance of drug resistance. To improve clinicaloutcomes and contain the spread of infections, the development of newerdiagnostic tools is imperative to reduce the time and cost involved to reach the farthest population. The current study focuses on the development of apoint-of-care technology that uses crystal violet entrapped, lectinfunctionalized chitosan nanoparticles to detect the presence of clinicallyrelevant bacterial infections. Spherical nanoparticles of <200 nm in diametermake up the biosensing nanomaterial, showed specific clumping in the presence of bacteria to form visible aggregates as compared to a nonbacterial sample. Visibleagglutination confirmed the presence of bacteria in the samples. The devicesrequire just 100 muL of sample and were tested with various bacteria-spikedsaline, simulated urine, artificial sputum, and simulated respiratory and woundswabs. The developed device did not require any sample preparation orsophisticated instruments while enabling rapid differentiation between bacterial and nonbacterial infections within 10 min. The in vitro results withbacteria-spiked simulated samples reveal 100% sensitivity and specificity with a limit of detection of 10(5) cfu/mL. The nanomaterial developed was found to bestable for more than 90 days at accelerated conditions. The developed device can be a screening tool for home-based or clinical assessment and follow thetreatment accordingly, reducing exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics in thecase of nonbacterial infections.

TI  - The Sixth Element: a 102-kb RepABC Plasmid of Xenologous Origin ModulatesChromosomal Gene Expression in Dinoroseobacter shibae.
PG  - e0026422
LID - 10.1128/msystems.00264-22 [doi]
AB  - The model organism Dinoroseobacter shibae and many other marine Rhodobacterales(Roseobacteraceae, Alphaproteobacteria) are characterized by a multipartitegenome organization. Here, we show that the original isolate (Dshi-6) containedsix extrachromosomal replicons (ECRs), whereas the strain deposited at the DSMZ(Dshi-5) lacked a 102-kb plasmid. To determine the role of the sixth plasmid, we investigated the genomic and physiological differences between the two strains.Therefore, both genomes were (re)sequenced, and gene expression, growth, andsubstrate utilization were examined. For comparison, we included additionalplasmid-cured strains in the analysis. In the Dshi-6 population, the conjugative 102-kb RepABC-9 plasmid was present in only about 50% of the cells, irrespective of its experimentally validated stability. In the presence of the sixth plasmid, copy number changes of other ECRs, in particular, a decrease of the 86-kbplasmid, were observed. The most conspicuous finding was the strong influence of plasmids on chromosomal gene expression, especially the repression of the CtrAregulon and the activation of the denitrification gene cluster. Expression isinversely controlled by either the presence of the 102-kb plasmid or the absence of the 86-kb plasmid. We identified regulatory genes on both plasmids, i.e., asigma 70 factor and a quorum sensing synthase, that might be responsible forthese major changes. The tremendous effects that were probably evenunderestimated challenge the current understanding of the relevance of volatileplasmids not only for the original host but also for new recipients afterconjugation. IMPORTANCE Plasmids are small DNA molecules that replicateindependently of the bacterial chromosome. The common view of the role ofplasmids is dominated by the accumulation of resistance genes, which isresponsible for the antibiotic crisis in health care and livestock breeding.Beyond rapid adaptations to a changing environment, no general relevance for the host cell's regulome was attributed to these volatile ECRs. The current studyshows for the model organism D. shibae that its chromosomal gene expression isstrongly influenced by two plasmids. We provide evidence that the gain or loss ofplasmids not only results in minor alterations of the genetic repertoire but alsocan have tremendous effects on bacterial physiology. The central role of someplasmids in the regulatory network of the host could also explain theirpersistence despite fitness costs, which has been described as the "plasmidparadox."

AB  - Temporary waters are common environments found in physical and biologicalsubstrates. Among them, some bromeliads species are known to hold water in their tanks, in a habitat called phytotelmata. Phytotelmata serve as habitats forseveral organisms, from bacteria and protists to arthropods and anurans.Peritrich ciliates are often found as epibionts on aquatic invertebrates in theseenvironments. Here, we report two cases of epibiosis involving Lagenophrys sp.attached to ostracods (Elpidium spp.) and Rhabdostyla sp. colonizing hydrachnidmites in the tanks of two bromeliad species. In our analysis, we measured thefrequency of epibiosis considering the presence of both basibiont and epibiont inthe samples. The results shown a significant difference between Elpidium sp. and Lagenophrys sp. compared to hydrachnid mites and Rhabdostyla sp. (87.5% and 19%, respectively), supported by the Kruskal-Walis test (p = 0.0003, Chi-square =9.687). These reports are important since the knowledge of phytotelmatacommunities from tropical and subtropical areas is incipient, although it hasbeen increasing over the last years. It also shows that epibiosis doesn't always represent a beneficial relationship. These two epibiosis systems found inbromeliad tanks raise questions about organism's dispersal throughout otherphytotelmata and other temporary water habitats.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The increase in antibiotic resistance (AR) is a global phenomenon withregional variation. This survey aims to describe the AR in urine cultures ofwomen from the community in a southern Brazil city. METHODS: A retrospectivecross-sectional single-center study in urine cultures of community dwellingindividuals. The main outcome was the AR profile of bacterial isolates from womenin outpatient care. RESULTS: From 4,011 urine cultures, 524 were positive (91%from women). The most frequently isolated bacteria were Escherichia coli (E.coli) (67.0%) and Klebsiella spp. (19.4%). E. coli presented low resistance tonitrofurantoin (3.7%), moderate to levofloxacin (15.6%), amoxacillin-clavulonate (16.4%) and ciprofloxacin (17.4%), and high to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole(26.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Nitrofurantoin seems to be the best choice for theempirical treatment of low urinary tract infections in women, whereassulfonamides are no longer an option, since E. coli resistance to this drug isabove 20%.

TI  - Evaluation of cytokine profile in cervicovaginal lavage specimens of women havingasymptomatic reproductive tract infections.
PG  - 1-6
LID - 10.1080/01443615.2022.2106555 [doi]
AB  - Reproductive tract infections (RTIs) such as vaginal candidiasis and bacterialvaginosis (BV) are common among sexually active women and can be both symptomaticor asymptomatic. The microbiota of the reproductive tract triggers immuneresponse at the cervicovaginal interface resulting in secretion of cytokinesduring the course of these RTIs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cytokine profile in cervicovaginal lavage of women having asymptomatic vaginalinfections. Measurement of vaginal cytokines was done for various interleukinsincluding IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12/IL23p40, IL-17A, tumour necrosisfactor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) by ProcartaPlexMultiplex Immunoassay. Women having vaginal Candida infection had increasedconcentration of IL-1beta (p=.01), IL-6 (p=.007), IL-8 (p=.327), IL-12/IL23p40(p=.049) and IFN-gamma (p=.125). The results of our study suggest that evaluationof these cytokines could be explored as an additional measure to determine hostinflammatory response in women having asymptomatic vaginal candidiasis.ImpactStatementWhat is already known on this subject? Studies assessing the vaginalcytokine profile to assess the vaginal milieu in various cohorts such aspost-menopausal women, pregnant women, women with history of preterm birth, CINand scheduled IVF cycle are being undertaken. Variable cytokine response has beenreported in literature in women with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis and Candida infection. However, much less is known about vaginal cytokine profile inasymptomatic infection.What do the results of this study add? The results of the study show increased concentration of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta,IL-6 IL-8, IL-12/IL23p40 and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in women havingasymptomatic Candida, vaginal leucocytosis and raised vaginal pH.What are theimplications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research?Evaluation of vaginal cytokine profile (IL-1beta, IL-6 IL-8, IL-1beta,IL-12/IL23p40 and IFN-gamma) could be explored as an additional measure todetermine inflammation in asymptomatic women. Vaginal cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6IL-8, IL-1beta, IL-12/IL23p40 and IFN-gamma) could be used further fordevelopment of a point of care test.

TI  - A NIR-II light-modulated injectable self-healing hydrogel for synergisticphotothermal/chemodynamic/chemo-therapy of melanoma and wound healing promotion.
LID - 10.1039/d2tb00923d [doi]
AB  - The development of an injectable multifunctional hydrogel with tumor therapy,antibacterial treatment and wound healing properties is essential forsimultaneously eradicating melanoma and promoting wound healing oftumor-initiated skin defects. Herein, iron ion-doped polyaniline (PANI(Fe))tethered with guar gum (GG) chains is employed for the first time as a buildingunit for constructing a superior hydrogel (GG@PANI(Fe)-borax) crosslinked byborate/didiol bonds. Due to the dynamic and reversible properties of boronateester bonds, the GG@PANI(Fe)-borax hydrogels had convenient injectability, rapid self-healing ability, and reversible gel-sol transformations under thermal- orpH-stimuli. More importantly, they took advantage of the second near-infrared(NIR-II) responsive photothermal conversion capability, accompanied by thephotothermal-enhanced high cytotoxic OH generation in the H2O2-enriched tumormicroenvironment induced by iron-doped PANI. The as-prepared hydrogels exhibited excellent photothermal effects and controllable NIR-triggered drug release,leading to distinctly synergistic photothermal/chemodynamic/chemo-therapy effectsof melanoma both in vitro (98.2%) and in vivo (98.8%). In addition, the obtained hydrogels also exhibited good anti-bacterial activity (>97.1%) against bothGram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli)bacteria because they were based on PANI(Fe) and borax, which exhibitantibacterial activity. Furthermore, these GG@PANI(Fe)-incorporated scaffoldscould improve fibroblast cell proliferation and angiogenesis for acceleratingwound repair in tumor-bearing and infected wound mice. Taken together,GG@PANI(Fe)-borax hydrogels may be used simultaneously for eradication ofskin-tumor cells, inhibiting infection and accelerating wound healing. This work offers an effective and facile strategy to fabricate an "all-in-one"multifunctional hydrogel platform for synergetic multimodal integrated therapy oftumors.

TI  - Detection of trh(+) Vibrio parahaemolyticus in seafood by lac dyecoloration-based label-free lateral flow immunoassay strip.
LID - 10.1111/jfd.13692 [doi]
AB  - Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) is an important foodborne pathogen known to cause severe enteric disease. Thus, timely detection of V.parahaemolyticus in seafood is crucial to prevent food poisoning and reduceeconomic losses. Traditional lateral flow immunoassay strips (LFIS) required goodlabelling materials and pairing of two antibodies, which made them costly anddifficult to manufacture. In this study, a label-free and lac dyecoloration-based LFIS (LD-LFIS) to detect trh(+) V. parahaemolyticus wasdeveloped for the first time. Lac dye was used to stain V. parahaemolyticus, and LFIS was used to detect stained bacteria. Dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) andsimultaneous mordanting were chosen as the best solvent and the best stainingmethod for lac dye. In addition, three mordants [KAl(SO4 )2 .12H2 O, NH4 Fe(SO4)2 .12H2 O, and AlCl3 .6H2 O] were selected to improve dyeing efficiency. Thedetection limit of LD-LFIS was 3.9 x 10(5) CFU/ml when NH4 Fe(SO4 )2 .12H2 O was used as mordant. Feasibility of the LD-LFIS method was verified by detectingtrh(+) V. parahaemolyticus in true and spiked seafood samples. The methoddeveloped in this study is expected to reduce restrictions on labelling materialsand pairing of two antibodies on LFIS, and proposes a novel idea for the rapiddetection of V. parahaemolyticus in seafood.

TI  - Molecular basis of anti-CRISPR operon repression by Aca10.
LID - gkac656 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac656 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-Cas systems are bacterial defense systems for fighting against invaderssuch as bacteriophages and mobile genetic elements. To escape destruction bythese bacterial immune systems, phages have co-evolved multiple anti-CRISPR (Acr)proteins, which inhibit CRISPR-Cas function. Many acr genes form an operon withgenes encoding transcriptional regulators, called anti-CRISPR-associated (Aca)proteins. Aca10 is the most recently discovered Aca family that is encoded withinan operon containing acrIC7 and acrIC6 in Pseudomonas citronellolis. Here, wereport the high-resolution crystal structure of an Aca10 protein to unveil themolecular basis of transcriptional repressor role of Aca10 in theacrIC7-acrIC6-aca10 operon. We identified that Aca10 forms a dimer in solution,which is critical for binding specific DNA. We also showed that Aca10 directlyrecognizes a 21 bp palindromic sequence in the promoter of the acr operon.Finally, we revealed that R44 of Aca10 is a critical residue involved in the DNA binding, which likely results in a high degree of DNA bending.

AB  - Despite advances in bacterial genome engineering, delivery of large syntheticconstructs remains challenging in practice. In this study, we propose astraightforward and robust approach for the markerless integration of DNAfragments encoding whole metabolic pathways into the genome. This approach relieson the replacement of a counterselection marker with cargo DNA cassettes vialambdaRed recombineering. We employed a counterselection strategy involving agenetic circuit based on the CI repressor of lambda phage. Our design ensureselimination of most spontaneous mutants, and thus provides a counterselectionstringency close to the maximum possible. We improved the efficiency ofintegrating long PCR-generated cassettes by exploiting the Ocr antirestrictionfunction of T7 phage, which completely prevents degradation of unmethylated DNAby restriction endonucleases in wild-type bacteria. The employment of highlyrestrictive counterselection and ocr-assisted lambdaRed recombineering allowedmarkerless integration of operon-sized cassettes into arbitrary genomic loci offour enterobacterial species with an efficiency of 50-100%. In the case ofEscherichia coli, our strategy ensures simple combination of markerless mutationsin a single strain via P1 transduction. Overall, the proposed approach can serve as a general tool for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering in a range ofbacterial hosts.

TI  - Alteration of DNA supercoiling serves as a trigger of short-term cold shockrepressed genes of E. coli.
LID - gkac643 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nar/gkac643 [doi]
AB  - Cold shock adaptability is a key survival skill of gut bacteria of warm-bloodedanimals. Escherichia coli cold shock responses are controlled by a complexmulti-gene, timely-ordered transcriptional program. We investigated itsunderlying mechanisms. Having identified short-term, cold shock repressed genes, we show that their responsiveness is unrelated to their transcription factors or global regulators, while their single-cell protein numbers' variability increasesafter cold shock. We hypothesized that some cold shock repressed genes could betriggered by high propensity for transcription locking due to changes in DNAsupercoiling (likely due to DNA relaxation caused by an overall reduction innegative supercoiling). Concomitantly, we found that nearly half of cold shockrepressed genes are also highly responsive to gyrase inhibition (albeit mostgenes responsive to gyrase inhibition are not cold shock responsive). Further,their response strengths to cold shock and gyrase inhibition correlate.Meanwhile, under cold shock, nucleoid density increases, and gyrases and nucleoidbecome more colocalized. Moreover, the cellular energy decreases, which mayhinder positive supercoils resolution. Overall, we conclude that sensitivity todiminished negative supercoiling is a core feature of E. coli's short-term, cold shock transcriptional program, and could be used to regulate the temperaturesensitivity of synthetic circuits.

LID - 10.1080/21505594.2022.2107646 [doi]
AB  - Porcine rotavirus (PoRV) is an important pathogen, leading to the occurrence ofviral diarrhoea . As the infection displays obvious enterotropism, intestinalmucosal immunity is the significant line of defence against pathogen invasion.Moreover, as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) show acid resistance, bile saltresistance and immune regulation, it is of great significance to develop an oral vaccine. Most traditional plasmid delivery vectors use antibiotic genes asselective markers, easily leading to antibiotic accumulation. Therefore, toselect a food-grade marker in genetically engineering food-grade microorganismsis vital. Based on the CRISPR-Cas9D10A system, we constructed a stableauxotrophic Lactobacillus paracasei HLJ-27 (Lactobacillus big up tri, openAlrHLJ-27) strain. In addition, as many plasmids replicate in the host bacteria,resulting in internal gene deletions. In this study,we used atemperature-sensitive gene editing plasmidto insert the VP4 gene into the genome,yielding the insertion mutant strains VP4/ big up tri, openAlr HLJ-27, VP4/ bigup tri, openAlr W56, and VP4/W56. This recombinant bacterium efficiently induced secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-based humoral immune responses. These oral mucosal vaccines have the potential to actas an alternative to the application of antibiotics in the future and induceefficient immune responses against PEDV infection.

TI  - Effects of boric acid and potassium metaborate on cytokine levels and redoxstress parameters in a wound model infected with methicillinresistantStaphylococcus aureus.

LID - 294 [pii]
AB  - Methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are usually found inhospital settings and, frequently, in patients with open wounds. One of the most critical virulence factors affecting the severity and recurrence of infections isthe biofilm; increasing antibiotic resistance due to biofilm formation has led tothe search for alternative compounds to antibiotics. The present study aimed touse boric acid and potassium metaborate against MRSA infection in a fibroblastwound model. For this purpose, a twopart experiment was designed: First, MRSAstrains were used for the test, and both boric acid and potassium metaborate wereprepared in microdilution. In the second step, an MRSA wound model was preparedusing a fibroblast culture, and treatments with boric acid and potassiummetaborate were applied for 24 h. For the evaluation of the effects of treatment,cell viability assay (MTT assay), analysis of redox stress parameters, including total oxidant status and total antioxidant capacity analyses, lactatedehydrogenase analysis and immunohistochemical staining were performed. Inaddition, IL1beta and IL10 gene expression levels were assayed. According to the results, potassium metaborate was more effective and exhibited a lower toxicityto fibroblast cells compared to boric acid; moreover, potassium metaboratedecreased the level of prooxidant species and increased the antioxidant statusmore effectively than boric acid. The IL1beta level in the bacteria group washigh; however, boric acid and potassium metaborate significantly decreased theexpression levels of inflammatory markers, exhibiting the potential to improvethe resolution of the lesion. On the whole, the findings of the present studysuggest that boric acid and potassium metaborate may be effective on the testedmicroorganisms.

AB  - The anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) bacteria can transform ammonium andnitrite to dinitrogen gas, and this obligate anaerobic process accounts for up tohalf of the global nitrogen loss in surface environments. Yet its origin andevolution, which may give important insights into the biogeochemistry of earlyEarth, remains enigmatic. Here, we performed comprehensive phylogenomic andmolecular clock analysis of anammox bacteria within the phylum Planctomycetes.After accommodating the uncertainties and factors influencing time estimates,which includes implementing both a traditional cyanobacteria-based and a recentlydeveloped mitochondria-based molecular dating approach, we estimated a consistentorigin of anammox bacteria at early Proterozoic and most likely around theso-called Great Oxidation Event (GOE; 2.32 to 2.5 billion years ago [Ga]) whichfundamentally changed global biogeochemical cycles. We further showed that duringthe origin of anammox bacteria, genes involved in oxidative stress adaptation,bioenergetics and anammox granules formation were recruited, which might havecontributed to their survival on an increasingly oxic Earth. Our findings suggestthe rising levels of atmospheric oxygen, which made nitrite increasinglyavailable, was a potential driving force for the emergence of anammox bacteria.This is one of the first studies that link the GOE to the evolution of obligateanaerobic bacteria.

TI  - Production of 5-aminolevulinic acid from hydrolysates of cassava residue and fishwaste by engineered Bacillus cereus PT1.
LID - 10.1111/1751-7915.14118 [doi]
AB  - The economical production of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) has recently receivedincreasing attention for its extensive use in agriculture. In this study, astrain of Bacillus cereus PT1 could initially produce ALA at a titre of 251.72mg/L by using a hydrolysate mixture of low-cost cassava residue and fish waste.The integration of endogenous hemA encoding glutamyl-tRNA reductase led to a39.30% increase in ALA production. Moreover, improving cell permeability bydeletion of the LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP) family gene tagU led to a further increase of59.73% in ALA production. Finally, the engineered strain B. cereusPT1-hemA-DeltatagU produced 2.62 g/L of ALA from the previously mentionedhydrolysate mixture in a 7-L bioreactor. In a pot experiment, foliar spray of theALA produced by B. cereus PT1-hemA-DeltatagU from the hydrolysates increased salttolerance of cucumber by improving chlorophyll content and catalase activity,while decreasing malondialdehyde content. Overall, this study demonstrated aneconomic way to produce ALA using a microbial platform and evidenced thepotential of ALA in agricultural application.

AB  - This paper reports a presumptive severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a cat. A cat with respiratory disease living with threeindividuals with coronavirus disease 2019 showed bilateral ground-glass opacitiesin the lung on X-ray and computed tomography. The clinical swabs were negativefor SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but the serum was positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.Interstitial pneumonia and prominent type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia were noted on histopathology. Respiratory tissues were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen, but the cat was positive for feline parvovirus DNA. In conclusion, therespiratory disease and associated pathology in this cat could have been due toexposure to SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The commercially available Newcastle disease (ND) vaccines weredeveloped based on Newcastle disease virus (NDV) isolates genetically divergentfrom field strains that can only prevent clinical disease, not shedding ofvirulent heterologous virus, highlighting the need to develop genotype-matchedvaccines. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the efficacy of the NDVgenotype-matched vaccine, mIBS025 strain formulated in standard vaccinestabilizer, and in carboxymethyl sago starch-acid hydrogel (CMSS-AH) followingvaccination via an eye drop (ED) and drinking water (DW). METHODS: A challengevirus was prepared from a recent NDV isolated from ND vaccinated flock. Groups ofspecific-pathogen-free chickens were vaccinated with mIBS025 vaccine strainprepared in a standard vaccine stabilizer and CMSS-AH via ED and DW and thenchallenged with the UPM/NDV/IBS362/2016 strain. RESULTS: Chickens vaccinated withCMSS-AH mIBS025 ED (group 2) developed the earliest and highest Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) NDV antibody titer (8log2) followed by standard mIBS025 ED (group3) (7log2) both conferred complete protection and drastically reduced virusshedding. By contrast, chickens vaccinated with standard mIBS025 DW (group 5) andCMSS-AH mIBS025 DW (group 4) developed low HI NDV antibody titers of 4log2 and3log2, respectively, which correspondingly conferred only 50% and 60% protection and continuously shed the virulent virus via the oropharyngeal and cloacal routesuntil the end of the study at 14 dpc. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of mIBS025vaccines prepared in a standard vaccine stabilizer or CMSS-AH was affected by thevaccination routes. The groups vaccinated via ED had better protective immunitythan those vaccinated via DW.

TI  - Modulating streptococcal phenotypes using signal peptide analogues.
PG  - 220143
LID - 10.1098/rsob.220143 [doi]
AB  - Understanding bacterial communication mechanisms is imperative to improve ourcurrent understanding of bacterial infectivity and find alternatives to currentmodes of antibacterial therapeutics. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negativebacteria use quorum sensing (QS) to regulate group behaviours and associatedphenotypes in a cell-density-dependent manner. Group behaviours, phenotypicexpression and resultant infection and disease can largely be attributed toefficient bacterial communication. Of particular interest are the communicationmechanisms of Gram-positive bacteria known as streptococci. This group hasdemonstrated marked resistance to traditional antibiotic treatment, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality of infected hosts and an ever-increasing burdenon the healthcare system. Modulating circuits and mechanisms involved instreptococcal communication has proven to be a promising anti-virulencetherapeutic approach that allows managing bacterial phenotypic response but does not affect bacterial viability. Targeting the chemical signals bacteria use forcommunication is a promising starting point, as manipulation of these signals candramatically affect resultant bacterial phenotypes, minimizing associatedmorbidity and mortality. This review will focus on the use of modified peptidesignals in modulating the development of proliferative phenotypes in differentstreptococcal species, specifically regarding how such modification can attenuatebacterial infectivity and aid in developing future alternative therapeuticagents.

TI  - 'omics-guided prediction of the pathway for metabolism of isoprene by Variovorax sp. WS11.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.16149 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria which inhabit soils and the leaves of trees partially mitigate therelease of the abundant volatile organic compound, isoprene(2-methyl-1,3-butadiene). While the initial steps of isoprene metabolism wereidentified in Rhodococcus sp. AD45 two decades ago, the isoprene metabolicpathway still remains largely undefined. Limited understanding of the functionsof isoG, isoJ and aldH, and uncertainty in the route of isoprene-derived carboninto central metabolism have hindered our understanding of isoprene metabolism.These previously uncharacterised iso genes are essential in Variovorax sp. WS11, determined by targeted mutagenesis. Using combined 'omics-based approaches, wepropose the complete isoprene metabolic pathway. Isoprene is converted topropionyl-CoA which is assimilated by the chromosomally-encoded methylmalonyl-CoApathway, requiring biotin and vitamin B12, with the plasmid-encoded methylcitratepathway potentially providing robustness against limitations in these vitamins.Key components of this pathway were induced by both isoprene and its initialoxidation product, epoxyisoprene, the principal inducer of isoprene metabolism inboth Variovorax sp. WS11 and Rhodococcus sp. AD45. Analysis of the genomes ofdistinct isoprene-degrading bacteria indicated that the genetic components of themethylcitrate and methylmalonyl-CoA pathways are not always present in isoprenedegraders, although incorporation of isoprene-derived carbon via propionyl-CoAand acetyl-CoA is universally indicated.

TI  - Rhizobium leguminosarum symbiovar viciae strains are natural wheat endophytesthat can stimulate root development.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.16148 [doi]
AB  - Although rhizobia that establish a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis with legumes arealso known to promote growth in non-legumes, studies on rhizobial associationswith wheat roots are scarce. We searched for Rhizobium leguminosarum symbiovarviciae (Rlv) strains naturally competent to endophytically colonize wheat roots. We isolated 20 strains from surface-sterilized wheat roots, and found a lowdiversity of Rlv compared to that observed in the Rlv species complex. We tested the ability of a subset of these Rlv for wheat root colonization whenco-inoculated with other Rlv. Only a few strains, including those isolated fromwheat roots, and one strain isolated from pea nodules, were efficient incolonizing roots in co-inoculation conditions, while all the strains tested insingle strain inoculation conditions were found to colonize the surface andinterior of roots. Furthermore, Rlv strains isolated from wheat roots were ableto stimulate root development and early arbuscular mycorrhizal fungicolonization. These responses were strain and host genotype dependent. Ourresults suggest that wheat can be an alternative host for Rlv; nevertheless,there is a strong competition between Rlv strains for wheat root colonization. Inaddition, we showed that Rlv are endophytic wheat root bacteria with potentialability to modify wheat development.

TI  - Genetic diversity of honeybee colonies predicts gut bacterial diversity ofindividual colony members.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.16150 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota of social bees is relatively simple and dominated by a set of core taxa found consistently in individuals around the world. Yet, variationremains, and can affect host health. We characterised individual- andregional-scale variation in honeybee (Apis mellifera) gut microbiota from 64colonies in North-West England by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and asked whether microbiota were influenced by host genotype and landscapecomposition. We also characterised the genotypes of individual bees and the land cover surrounding each colony. The literature-defined core taxa dominated across the region despite the varied environments. However, there was variation in therelative abundance of core taxa, and colony membership explained much of thisvariation. Individuals from more genetically diverse colonies had more diversemicrobiotas, but individual genetic diversity did not influence gut microbialdiversity. There were weak trends for colonies in more similar landscapes to havemore similar microbiota, and for bees from more urban landscapes to have lessdiverse microbiota. To our knowledge, this is the first report for any speciesthat the gut bacterial communities of individuals are influenced by the genotypesof others in the population.

PG  - 20220581
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2022.0581 [doi]
AB  - Dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes by horizontal gene transfer(HGT) mediated through plasmids is a major global concern. Genomic epidemiologystudies have shown varying success of different AMR plasmids during outbreaks,but the underlying reasons for these differences are unclear. Here, weinvestigated two Shigella plasmids (pKSR100 and pAPR100) that circulated in thesame transmission network but had starkly contrasting epidemiological outcomes toidentify plasmid features that may have contributed to the differences. We usedplasmid comparative genomics to reveal divergence between the two plasmids ingenes encoding AMR, SOS response alleviation and conjugation. Experimentalanalyses revealed that these genomic differences corresponded with reducedconjugation efficiencies for the epidemiologically successful pKSR100, but moreextensive AMR, reduced fitness costs, and a reduced SOS response in the presence of antimicrobials, compared with the less successful pAPR100. The discrepantphenotypes between the two plasmids are consistent with the hypothesis thatplasmid-associated phenotypes contribute to determining the epidemiologicaloutcome of AMR HGT and suggest that phenotypes relevant in responding toantimicrobial pressure and fitness impact may be more important than those aroundconjugation in this setting. Plasmid phenotypes could thus be valuable tools inconjunction with genomic epidemiology for predicting AMR dissemination.

LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03303 [doi]
AB  - Acinetobacter johnsonii is one of the major food-spoilage bacteria and cansurvive under cold stress. In this study, the membrane composition, membranepermeability, and energy transduction of A. johnsonii XY27 cultured at 4 and 30degrees C were examined comparatively by flow cytometry combined with liquidchromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. TheNa(+)/K(+)ATPase activity, alkaline phosphatase and ATPase activity, fluorescenceintensity, and cell viability in A. johnsonii XY27 increased with the decrease incultivation temperature. The polyunsaturated fatty acid and monounsaturated fattyacids have a higher content in A. johnsonii XY27 cultured at 4 degrees C comparedto that cultured at 30 degrees C, in which the contents of methyl palmitoleate,methyl myristoleate, and methyl oleate increased dramatically with decreasingtemperature. Comparative proteomics analysis revealed that 31 proteins weredownregulated and 4 proteins were upregulated, in which catalase-peroxidase 1 andcold shock proteins as biomarker proteins could effectively control A. johnsonii during cold adaptation.

AB  - Multi-elemental, isotope selective nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry(NanoSIMS) combined with confocal laser-scanning microscopy was used tocharacterize the subcellular distribution of (15)N-labeled cisplatin in humancolon cancer cells. These analyses indicated predominant cisplatin colocalisationwith sulfur-rich structures in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Furthermore,colocalisation of platinum with phosphorus-rich chromatin regions was observed,which is consistent with its binding affinity to DNA as the generally acceptedcrucial target of the drug. Application of (15)N-labeled cisplatin and subsequentmeasurement of the nitrogen isotopic composition and determination of therelative intensities of platinum and nitrogen associated secondary ion signals indifferent cellular compartments with NanoSIMS suggested partial dissociation ofPt-N bonds during the accumulation process, in particular within nucleoli atelevated cisplatin concentrations. This finding raises the question as to whetherthe observed intracellular dissociation of the drug has implications for themechanism of action of cisplatin. Within the cytoplasm, platinum mainlyaccumulated in acidic organelles, as demonstrated by a direct combination ofspecific fluorescent staining, confocal laser scanning microscopy and NanoSIMS.Different processing of platinum drugs in acidic organelles might be relevant fortheir detoxification, as well as for their mode of action.

AB  - Rickettsial diseases (RD) are a group of endotheliotropic infectious diseasescaused by different species of genera Rickettsia. RD are not an uncommon disease and may be misdiagnosed during the evaluation of acute febrile illness due to alack of reliable serological marker and diagnostic culture methods. Clinicalmanifestation of RD varies from febrile illness with rashes and myalgia to fatal complications such as shock and respiratory failure. We describe a case of ayoung male who presented initially with acute febrile illness, followed by shock and respiratory failure, and unfortunately succumbed to death. A post-mortemexamination showed histological features of endotheliotropic infection, such asinterstitial / perivascular edema in various organs and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (suggesting increased vascular permeability) and evidence of vasculitis in the lung, liver, and intestines. Molecular studies performed from lung, liver,and kidney tissue confirm the diagnosis of spotted fever group rickettsialdisease due to Rickettsia conorii.

AB  - Due to the high prevalence of multi-drug resistant bacteria, combination therapy is an efficient choice for treatment of infections caused by highly resistantstrains. In this study, the efficacy of ceftiofur plus danofloxacin combinationwas investigated against resistant Escherichia coli. The interaction between the two drugs was determined by checkerboard tests and time-kill assays. Thecombination was defined as bactericidal or bacteriostatic based on the minimumbactericidal concentration test results. Mutant prevention concentration test wasused to evaluate the resistance tendency suppression potential of thecombination. The combination had a synergistic effect against 83.00% of theisolates as verified by the checkerboard and time-kill assays. The combinationwas defined as bactericidal against all E. coli strains, since minimumbactericidal concentration: minimum inhibitory concentration ratios were belowfour thresholds and also markedly reduced mutant prevention concentration values of ceftiofur up to 4000-fold compared to its single use. Ceftiofur plusdanofloxacin combination inhibited growth of E. coli strains which were resistantto ceftiofur or newer generation of fluoroquinolones. Our results suggest thatceftiofur plus danofloxacin combination has a bactericidal characteristic and canbe an important alternative for the treatment of infections caused by resistantE. coli.

AB  - The study was designed to explore anatomical and histological vasculature changesin the female genital system of camel and serological aspects that might beresponsible to maintain thermoregulation. Twenty-four adult female camels weresampled during breeding (November-April) and non-breeding (May-October) season.Blood was collected for estrogen, progesterone and cortisol level estimation.Genital organs were sampled and described after slaughtering. Samples were taken from the ovarian artery (OA), vein (OV) and arterio-venous complex (AVC), forlight and scanning electron microscopy. Sections were stained with Hematoxylinand Eosin. (H&E), Masson's trichrome, Weigert's elastic and toluidine blue.Temperature and relative humidity were used to calculate stress indicator. Stressindicator was higher in non-breeding season (NBS). Anatomical and histologicalvasculature (OA, OV, AVC) dynamics were significantly higher in breeding season(BS) especially diameter of left OA. Parameters of OA were positively associated with estrogen level. Collagen, elastic, smooth muscles and mast cells wererecorded least in BS compared to NBS. Unique venous structure, intra-muralvenules (IMV), was discovered in tunica intima of OA, seen positively andnegatively associated with estrogen and cortisol level in BS, respectively.Scanned electron-micrograph exhibited penetration and wrapping of OA by smallthinned-walled venules that may form IMV. The AVC was too tightly packed todifferentiate due to the collapse of the wall. Hormonal, seasonal, stressindicator and vascular dynamic of female genital system are interlinked and IMVin association with OA and OV may be proposed as the site of counter-currentexchange in female reproductive system of the camel.

AB  - Piglets suffer from diarrhea caused by the Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli(STEC) and can be carriers of the bacteria, with public health consequences indeveloping countries. The aim of the present study was to study the prevalence ofSTEC O157 in feces of 465 piglets and 54 food mixes from backyard systems, theantimicrobial susceptibility of STEC and the frequency of genes encodingextended-spectrum beta-lactamases. The E. coli was isolated from 75.90 % of theevaluated feces. The STEC strains were identified in 33.11% of the sampledpopulation and in 43.60% of the piglets carrying E. coli. Among STEC strains, thestx1 gene was the most frequent (22.30%). The rfbO157 gene was amplified in47.40% of the STEC strains. High frequencies of STEC strains were not susceptibleto ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline. The blaTEM gene (52) was the most frequent among strains not susceptible to ampicillin. Class 1 integrons were the most frequent in those strains. Of the identified STEC strains, 48.70% wereconsidered as multi-drug resistant and 1.90% were considered extensively drugresistant. In the supplied food, STEC O157 strains were identified in 25.00% ofthe STEC strains. We conclude that the piglets from backyard systems are carriersof STEC O157 strains not susceptible to common antibiotics, including penicillinsand tetracyclines. In addition, supplied food is a source of this type ofpathogenic bacteria. Through their direct contact with humans, the piglets andfood represent a potential source of bacterial dissemination capable of producinggastrointestinal infections in humans.

LID - 10.30466/vrf.2020.123330.2908 [doi]
AB  - Bovine Leukemia Virus (BLV) is an oncogenic retrovirus of the genusDeltaretrovirus. The genome of BLV encodes a cluster of 10 mature microRNAs(miRNAs). Considering the importance of miRNAs in regulating gene expression, it seems that each of the miRNAs of BLV plays a vital role in the process ofpathogenesis and tumorigenesis of the virus. First, sequences of each of themiRNAs of BLV were selected and downloaded from the miRBase database. Thesequences were then investigated using TargetScan and miRWalk to identify target genes of each of the mature miRNAs of the virus. Second, the expression levels ofthe two miRNAs with the highest number of target genes in B lymphocytes andlymphoid tissues were evaluated using qPCR and were compared between cattle with different forms of BLV infection: PL form was compared to aleukemic (AL) form(Group 1) and BLV+ with normal lymph nodes were compared to lymphosarcoma form(Group 2). We identified a total of 1595 target genes of the micro RNAs. ThemiRNAs with the highest target genes included miR-B4-3p with 760 and B2-5p with102 target genes. In the second phase, miRNA expression in BLV-infected animalswas investigated. The Fold Change (FC) values for miR-B4-3p and miR-B2-5p ingroup 1 were 22 and 67, respectively. In the second group, the FCs for miR-B4-3p and miR-B2-5p were 47 and 133, respectively. The expression was significantlyhigher in persistent lymphocytosis (PL) cattle in group one and lymphosarcomacattle in group two.

AB  - Otitis externa is an inflammatory disease of the external ear canal; atherapeutic alternative is the controlled-flux electrolyzed acidic solution(SAEFC) with bactericidal and bacteriostatic properties. The purpose of thisstudy was to evaluate the clinical and cytological efficacies of SAEFC in otitis externa. A total of 30 dogs were examined. The clinical and cytologicalevaluations were on days 1, 7 and 14; the following was considered: Pain,erythema, exudate, inflammation, ulcers, putrid odor and pigmentation.Cytological evaluations were carried out to examine the presence ofpolymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), intra-cellular bacteria (cocci; IC),extra-cellular bacteria (EC) and yeasts on days 1, 7 and 14. A cotton swabsaturated with SAEFC was applied for each dog's ear. The values of PMN diminishedhaving a significant difference between days. The presence of IC (cocci) had adifference in evaluations from day 1 to day 7 and from day 7 to day 14demonstrating an important drop. The evaluation of pain showed a sustaineddecrease until reaching 95.00% of remission, erythema diminished 68.33%, theexudate dropped to 90.00%, inflammation was no longer present by day 14 in 78.00%of the cases and 21.67% showed a slight inflammation, the putrid odor dropped to 95.00% and 5.00% presented a mild odor and by day 14 ear pigmentation was nolonger present in 51.67% of the cases and the 48.33% had slight pigmentation. Theuse of SAEFC is an effective alternative treatment in dogs with otitis externa.

PG  - 1169-1182
LID - 10.34067/KID.0001032022 [doi]
AB  - Background: Despite widespread use of renin-aldosterone-angiotensin systeminhibitors and the benefits of lowering glomerular pressure in patients with CKD,there remains a major unmet need for therapies targeting underlying causes of CKDprogression. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) promotes apoptosis andglomerulosclerosis, and is implicated in the progression of diabetic kidneydisease (DKD), a major cause of CKD. Selonsertib is a selective ASK1 inhibitorcurrently in clinical development for the treatment of DKD. We examined the addedbenefits of selonsertib on existing glomerulosclerosis and related molecularpathways in the nondiabetic 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 Nx) rat model in combinationwith the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) enalapril. Methods: Male Sprague Dawley rats underwent 5/6 Nx with kidney biopsy 8 weeks later forassessment of glomerulosclerosis, and were randomized to four treatment groupswith equal glomerulosclerosis: selonsertib, enalapril, combination (selonsertibplus enalapril), and untreated controls. Serum creatinine, systolic BP (SBP), andurinary albumin were measured at intervals. Animals were euthanized at week 12for histologic, biochemical, and molecular analyses. Results: All rats developed hypertension, albuminuria, and glomerulosclerosis by week 8. Kidney functionfurther declined, and glomerulosclerosis and albuminuria progressively increased in controls from week 8 to 12. Enalapril treatment alone from week 8 to 12reduced SBP versus controls, decreased albuminuria, and resulted in numericallylower glomerulosclerosis. Selonsertib alone had no effect on SBP but preservedkidney function. Combined treatment significantly reduced glomerulosclerosis,with more regression than either monotherapy. Enalapril treatment resulted infewer interstitial macrophages, whereas selonsertib treatment reduced apoptosisand podocyte loss. RNA-seq revealed that combined treatment influenced pathwaysrelated to extracellular matrix and wound healing. Conclusions: Selonsertibtargets a novel, nonhemodynamic pathway in CKD. Our data suggest that ASK1inhibition, when combined with ACEI, has additive effects to reduce progressionof glomerulosclerosis, attenuate kidney function decline, and reduce podocyteloss.

AB  - In the bone marrow, plasma cells are made up of B lymphocytes and are a type ofWBC. These plasma cells produce antibodies that help to keep bacteria and virusesat bay, thus preventing inflammation. This presents a major challenge forsegmenting blood cells, since numerous image processing methods are used beforesegmentation to enhance image quality. White blood cells can be analyzed by apathologist with the aid of computer software to identify blood diseasesaccurately and early. This study proposes a novel model that uses the ResNet and UNet networks to extract features and then segments leukocytes from bloodsamples. Based on the experimental results, this model appears to perform well,which suggests it is an appropriate tool for the analysis of hematology data. By evaluating the model using three datasets consisting of three different types of WBC, a cross-validation technique was applied to assess it based on the publicly available dataset. The overall segmentation accuracy of the proposed model wasaround 96%, which proved that the model was better than previous approaches, suchas DeepLabV3+ and ResNet-50.

AB  - In order to investigate the influencing factors of AAD in the emergency ward and the clinical effect of probiotics, 100 AAD patients admitted to the emergencyward of our hospital from January 2021 to January 2022 and 100 healthy physicalexamination subjects are selected for conducting clinical trials. The subjectsare, respectively, included in the AAD group and the healthy group. By using the random number table method, 100 patients in the AAD group are randomly dividedinto the probiotic group and traditional group, with 50 patients in each group.The traditional group receives conventional treatment, and the probiotic group istreated with Clostridium caseinate bifidobacterial probiotics additionally.Multivariate logistic analysis is performed on the risk factors for AAD, and the comparison of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and the intestinal microflora of the different groups before and after treatment isconducted. The experimental result reveals that probiotics treatment for AADpatients can reduce inflammatory response and promote intestinal colonization of beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria.

TI  - Multi-modality imaging and therapeutics used in a case of canine spinalnephroblastoma.
PG  - 811-818
AB  - A 4-year-old castrated male golden retriever dog was brought to a veterinaryteaching hospital for evaluation of acute progressive paraparesis. Neurologicalexamination indicated a spinal cord lesion between the third thoracic vertebraand third lumbar vertebrae. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed anintradural, extra medullary, and/or intramedullary mass centered over theeleventh and twelfth thoracic disc space. The dog underwent cytoreductive surgeryand histopathologic analysis diagnosed a nephroblastoma. Following this, the dog underwent multimodal therapy, including multiple surgeries, 2 courses ofradiation, and combination chemotherapy. The dog had serial restaging using MRI, computed tomography (CT), and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emissiontomography/computed tomography throughout the course of therapy. The dog survived350 d from date of first presentation until humane euthanasia was elected due to worsening of neurologic status. During postmortem examination, extensiveinfiltration of the spinal cord by nephroblastoma cells was discovered as well aspulmonary metastatic disease. Key clinical message: Based on the literaturesearch, this is the first case in which surgery, radiation therapy, andchemotherapy were all used for the treatment of canine spinal nephroblastoma.This case report details the aggressive nature of a case of canine spinalnephroblastoma despite multi-modal therapy.

TI  - Simultaneous Raman and infrared spectroscopy: a novel combination for studyingbacterial infections at the single cell level.
PG  - 8171-8179
LID - 10.1039/d2sc02493d [doi]
AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening clinical condition responsible for approximately 11 million deaths worldwide. Rapid and accurate identification of pathogenicbacteria and its antimicrobial susceptibility play a critical role in reducingthe morbidity and mortality rates related to sepsis. Raman and infraredspectroscopies have great potential to be used as diagnostic tools for rapid and culture-free detection of bacterial infections. Despite numerous reports usingboth methods to analyse bacterial samples, there is to date no study collectingboth Raman and infrared signatures from clinical samples simultaneously due toinstrument incompatibilities. Here, we report for the first time the use of anemerging technology that provides infrared signatures via optical photothermalinfrared (O-PTIR) spectroscopy and Raman spectra simultaneously. We use thisapproach to analyse 12 bacterial clinical isolates including six isolates ofGram-negative and six Gram-positive bacteria commonly associated with bloodstreaminfection in humans. To benchmark the single cell spectra obtained by O-PTIRspectroscopy, infrared signatures were also collected from bulk samples via both FTIR and O-PTIR spectroscopies. Our findings showed significant similarity andhigh reproducibility in the infrared signatures obtained by all three approaches,including similar discrimination patterns when subjected to clusteringalgorithms. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that O-PTIR and Raman data acquired simultaneously from bulk bacterial isolates displayed differentclustering patterns due to the ability of both methods to probe metabolitesproduced by bacteria. By contrast, signatures of microbial pigments wereidentified in Raman spectra, providing complementary and orthogonal informationcompared to infrared, which may be advantageous as it has been demonstrated that certain pigments play an important role in bacterial virulence. We found thatinfrared spectroscopy showed higher sensitivity than Raman for the analysis ofindividual cells. Despite the different patterns obtained by using Raman andinfrared spectral data as input for clustering algorithms, our findings showedhigh data reproducibility in both approaches as the biological replicates fromeach bacterial strain clustered together. Overall, we show that Raman andinfrared spectroscopy offer both advantages and disadvantages and, therefore,having both techniques combined in one single technology is a powerful tool with promising applications in clinical microbiology.

AB  - Rotational strip intercropping (RSI) of cereals and legumes has been developedand widely carried out to alleviate continuous cropping obstacles, to controlerosion and to improve field use efficiency. In this study, a four-yearfixed-field experiment was carried out in northeast China with three treatments: continuous cropping of maize, continuous cropping of peanuts and rotational stripintercropping of maize and peanut. The results show that crop rotation improvedthe main-stem height, branch number, lateral branch length, and yield and qualityof peanuts; the yield was the highest in 2018, when it was increased by 39.5%.RSI improved the contents of total N, available N, total P, available P, total K and available K; the content of available N was the highest in 2018, with anincrease of 70%. Rhizosphere soil urease and catalase activities weresignificantly increased and were the highest in 2017, reaching 183.13% and91.21%, respectively. According to a high-throughput sequencing analysis, therhizosphere soil bacterial richness and specific OTUs decreased in peanutrhizosphere soil, while the fungal increased. There were differences in thebacterial and fungal community structures; specifically, the abundance ofAcidobacteria and Planctomycetes increased among bacteria and the abundance ofbeneficial microorganisms such as Ascomycota increased among fungi. Inconclusion, rotational strip intercropping of maize and peanut increased theyield and quality of peanuts and conducive to alleviating the obstacles facingthe continuous cropping of peanuts. Among then, soil physicochemical properties, enzyme activity and microbial diversity were significantly affected the yield of peanut.

TI  - Role of Probiotics in the Management of Helicobacter pylori.
PG  - e26463
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26463 [doi]
AB  - The global prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is estimated to bearound 4.4 billion, with the majority of individuals affected in developingcountries. Chronic infection of the gram-negative bacterium results in severalgastrointestinal pathologies such as chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and cancer.Probiotics compete directly with H. pylori and help restore the gut microbialenvironment; these living microorganisms are comparatively more effective thanthe standard triple antibiotic regimen in the management of symptoms related tothe pathogenic bacteria. The need for alternative therapy is better explained by the increasing rate of antibiotic resistance and the lowering of patientcompliance to the standard treatment. Adjuvant administration of probiotics to H.pylori eradication therapy is associated with a higher H. pylori eradicationrate, decreased diarrhea-related treatment, less common self-reported sideeffects, and higher treatment compliance. Therefore, with the ongoing and future resistance to antibiotics, this systematic review aims to investigate the use andefficacy of probiotics when used alone or in conjunction with the currentguideline treatment. A literature search was conducted using Pubmed, MEDLINE, andCochrane for peer-reviewed articles published between January 1, 2016 and April2022. MeSH terms used were: "H. pylori," "H. pylori and probiotics,""Probiotics," "H. pylori treatment," "Mechanism of Action" with subheadings as"clinical manifestations," "treatment," and "diagnosis." All literature reviews, original papers, and case reports were included. This search strategy aimed tofind literature that could describe the transmission and mechanism of action ofH. pylori, the current treatment guidelines, and the efficacy of probiotics ineradicating H. pylori.

AB  - Laver (Porphya sp.) containing vitamins and minerals has a high total number ofbacteria of 6-7 log CFU/g. Changes in microbial count in dried laver by lightpulse, ultrahigh pressure, electron beam, and superheated steam treatment werecompared. It was decreased by 1.3-1.7 log using IPL (Intense Pulsed Light) for30-60 s at an irradiation distance of 80 mm in dried and wet laver. The keyparameters of IPL are energy intensity, processing time and irradiation distance.Light pulse inactivation is based on destruction of microbial DNA structure.Electron beam irradiation at 7 and 10 kGy resulted reduction of 1.8-3.2 logCFU/g. Dried laver was treated at 500 MPa of ultra-high pressure for 3 min, totalbacterial number showed no change. Applying superheated steam at 150 degrees Cfor 10 s, about 3.3 log CFU/g sterilized. However, it is difficult to apply dueto severe damage to sensory quality such as browning.

TI  - The AAV-PCSK9 murine model of atherosclerosis and metabolic dysfunction.
PG  - oeac028
LID - 10.1093/ehjopen/oeac028 [doi]
AB  - Aims: Mouse models with genetic modifications are required to investigateatherogenesis and associated metabolic syndrome. Adeno-associated virus-8(AAV8)-mediated overexpression of PCSK9 (AAV8-PCSK9) induces hyperlipidaemia and promotes atherosclerosis in C57BL/6 mice. We aimed to assess whetherAAV8-PCSK9-injected C57BL/6 mice fed high-fat diet with added cholesterol (HFD-C)would serve as a model of combined metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis.Methods and results: C57BL/6 mice received i.v. injection of AAV-PCSK9 and sex-and age-matched Ldlr(-/-) and C57BL/6 control mice were placed on HFD-C or chowdiet for 20 weeks (B6-PCSK9-HFD-C, Ldlr(-/-) HFD-C, B6-HFD-C, and B6-Chow,respectively). High-fat diet with added cholesterol feeding led to insulinresistance and impaired glucose clearance in B6-PCSK9-HFD-C mice compared withB6-Chow controls. This decrease in metabolic health in B6-PCSK9-HFD-C mice aswell as the development of atherosclerosis was similar to Ldlr(-/-) HFD-C mice.Importantly, HFD-C feeding induced pancreatic islet hyperplasia in B6-PCSK9-HFD-Cand B6-HFD-C compared with B6-Chow controls. In line with alterations in themetabolic phenotype, there was an increase in the number of pro-inflammatoryLy6C(high/med) monocytes within the adipose tissues of B6-PCSK9-HFD-C andB6-HFD-C compared with B6-Chow controls. Conclusion: High-fat diet with addedcholesterol-fed AAV-PCSK9-injected C57BL/6 mice can serve as a useful model ofintegrated metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis that does not require geneticmanipulations.

TI  - Ameliorative effect of Abeliophyllum distichum Nakai on benign prostatichyperplasia in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 419-434
LID - 10.4162/nrp.2022.16.4.419 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is the most commonprostate disease and one of the most common chronic diseases caused by aging inmen. On the other hand, there has been no research on BPH using Abeliophyllumdistichum Nakai (A. distichum). Therefore, this study investigated the effects ofA. distichum on BPH. MATERIALS/METHODS: A. distichum leaves were extracted withdistilled water, 70% ethanol, and 95% hexane as solvents. Subsequently, theinhibitory effects of each A. distichum extract on androgen receptor (AR)signaling were evaluated in vitro. The testosterone-induced BPH model was thenused to confirm the efficacy of A. distichum leaves in 70% ethanol extract(ADLE). RESULTS: ADLE had the strongest inhibitory effect on AR signaling. Acomparison of the activity of ADLE by harvest time showed that the leaves of A.distichum harvested in autumn had a superior inhibitory effect on AR signaling tothose harvested at other times. In the BPH rat model, the administration of ADLE reduced the prostate size and prostate epithelial cell thickness significantlyand inhibited AR signaling. Subsequently, the administration of ADLE also reducedthe expression of growth factors, thereby inactivating the PI3K/AKT pathway.CONCLUSIONS: An analysis of the efficacy of ADLE to relieve BPH showed that theethanol extract grown in autumn exhibited the highest inhibitory ability of theandrogen-signaling related factors in vitro. ADLE also inhibited the expressionof growth factors by inhibiting the expression of the androgen-signaling related factors in vivo. Overall, ADLE is proposed as a functional food that is effectivein preventing BPH.

PG  - 1384
LID - 10.3332/ecancer.2022.1384 [doi]
AB  - Background: Gynaecological cancer impacts approximately three million womenglobally. The problem is much more intense in resource-limited countries. Sexual health is a critical aspect of gynaecological cancer treatment and an importantcomponent of quality of life (QoL). Aims: This study aimed to assess thedeterminants of sexual function among survivors of gynaecological cancer. Method:This was a cross-sectional study. The simple random sampling technique was usedto recruit survivors of gynaecological cancers aged 18 years and above onfollow-up in a tertiary hospital in Kenya. Tools: The study used thesocio-demographic survey, Body Image Scale, Multidimensional Perceived SocialSupport Scale and Female Sexual Function Index. Results: Cervical cancer was the most common gynaecological malignancy among respondents (51%). The mean totalscore of the Female Sexual Function Index was significantly low at 10.0 (cut off = 26.5). The majority (85%) of respondents had sexual dysfunction. The mostcommonly affected sexual domain was lubrication at a mean value of 0.91 (SD =1.58). Age (aOR = 0.05, 95% CI: 0.003-0.16, p = 0.005), cancer stage 3 (aOR =9.81, 95% CI: 1.34-20.56, p = 0.035) and social support (aOR = 1.29, 95% CI:1.05-1.59, p = 0.015) were independent predictors of sexual dysfunction.Conclusion: The prevalence of sexual dysfunction among gynaecological cancersurvivors remains significantly high. Having cervical cancer was the mostsignificant predictor of sexual dysfunction in this study population.Recommendation: There is a need for further studies to improve the sexual lifeand hence the QoL among survivors of gynaecological malignancies.

TI  - The Impact of the Highly Virulent SARS-CoV-2 Gamma Variant on Young Adults in theState of Sao Paulo: Was It Inevitable?
PG  - e26486
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26486 [doi]
AB  - Background The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had and is stillhaving a tremendous impact on people all over the world, but it has beenparticularly harsh in South America. Nine out of 13 South American countries are among the 50 countries with the highest COVID-19 death rates. The gamma severeacute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant that emerged by theend of 2020 in the Brazilian Amazon quickly spread throughout the country causingthe harsh COVID-19 second wave. This variant displayed high viral loads, hightransmissibility, and increased virulence as compared to previous variants. Aims The aim of this retrospective study is to revisit and analyse the epidemiology ofthe COVID-19 second wave in the state of Sao Paulo, the most populous Brazilianstate. In addition to examining the possible factors that led to the emergenceand propagation of the gamma variant, measures that could have prevented itsspread and that of other highly virulent variants were also investigated.Materials and methods Data from Sao Paulo's official sources on morbidity,mortality, age distribution, and testing prior to and during the COVID-19 second wave (February - June 2021) and data regarding the distribution of SARS-CoV-2variants in the country were parsed, analyzed, and compared to the period thatanteceded the eruption of the second COVID-19 wave. Results In the state of SaoPaulo, the toll of the COVID-19 second wave surpassed that of the first 11 monthsof the pandemic (from March 2020 to January 2021), as 56% of the deaths occurred in the five months of the second wave between February and June 2021. The meanage of COVID-19 victims, which was already below life expectancy in the statedropped even further in the pandemic's second wave, reaching an average of 60years of age. The years of life lost per death per month doubled and thecase-fatality rate (CFR) of young adults (20-39 years old) more than trebledduring this period. A number of hypotheses have been raised that might explainthe emergence and spread of the gamma variant and the measures that could havebeen taken to prevent it and minimise its impact on the population. ConclusionsOver 142,000 people died as a result of the SARS-CoV-2 gamma variant sweep in SaoPaulo in the first semester of 2021. Due to its high viral load, the gammavariant displayed high transmissibility and a high degree of virulence resulting in increased case fatality rates across most age tiers. Notably, this second wavewas marked by a very significant increase in deaths among young adults. Thisincrease was at least partially due to a deterioration in general health provokedby non-pharmaceutical interventions. In hindsight, a safer and more effectivemeasure might have been to allow the free spread of the virus among the young andhealthy in the first wave, thus conferring immunity against more virulentvariants that emerged later on.

TI  - Natural-product-inspired design and synthesis of thiolated coenzyme Q analogs as promising agents against Gram-positive bacterial strains: insights intostructure-activity relationship, activity profile, mode of action, and molecular docking.

LID - 10.1039/d2ra02136f [doi]
AB  - In an attempt to develop effective and potentially active antibacterial and/orantifungal agents, we designed, synthesized, and characterized thiolated CoQanalogs (CoQ1-8) with an extensive antimicrobial study. The antimicrobial profileof these analogs was determined using four Gram-negative bacteria, threeGram-positive bacteria, and three fungi. Because of the fact that the thiolatedCoQ analogs were quite effective on all tested Gram-positive bacterial strains,including Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC(R) 29213) and Enterococcus faecalis(ATCC(R) 29212), the first two thiolated CoQ analogs emerged as potentially themost desirable ones in this series. Importantly, after the evaluation of theantibacterial and antifungal activity, we presented an initial structure-activityrelationship for these CoQ analogs. In addition, the most promising thiolated CoQanalogs (CoQ1 and CoQ2) having the lowest MIC values on all tested Gram-positive bacterial strains, were further evaluated for their inhibition capacities ofbiofilm formation after evaluating their in vitro potential antimicrobialactivity against each of 20 clinically obtained resistant strains ofGram-positive bacteria. CoQ1 and CoQ2 exhibited potential molecular interactions with S. aureus DNA gyrase in addition to excellent pharmacokinetics andlead-likeness profiles. Our findings offer important implications for a potentialantimicrobial drug candidate, in particular for the treatment of infectionscaused by clinically resistant MRSA isolates.

AB  - We report herein a case series of infants, with no comorbidities, who developed alife-threatening illness due to the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of children, aged under 15 years, admitted to PICU, during the peak of Delta infection, between June 23 and August 16 2021, withsevere and critical forms of SARS-CoV-2 infection, confirmed by RT-PCR. Twentyinfants were included, the median age was 47 days (IQR: 26.5-77) and sex ratiowas 0.8. No underlying medical conditions were noted. Parents were notvaccinated. Respiratory involvement was the main feature observed. Elevenpatients had paediatric acute respiratory distress (PARDS) with a median oxygensaturation index (OSI) of 9 (IQR: 7-11). PARDS was mild in four, moderate infive, and severe in two cases. Hemodynamic instability was observed in 4 cases.The main radiological finding was ground glass opacities in 11 cases. Seventeenpatients were mechanically ventilated, and three of them were escalated tohigh-frequency oscillatory ventilation. The median duration of mechanicalventilation was 6 days (IQR 2.5-12.5). The remaining patients were managed withhigh-flow nasal cannula. Four patients died.

TI  - Impact of a Laboratory-Developed Phenotypic Rapid Susceptibility Test DirectlyFrom Positive Blood Cultures on Time to Narrowest Effective Therapy in PatientsWith Gram-Negative Bacteremia: A Prospective Randomized Trial.
PG  - ofac347
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofac347 [doi]
AB  - Background: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) is often needed prior toantimicrobial optimization for patients with gram-negative bloodstream infections(GN-BSIs). Rapid AST (rAST) in combination with antimicrobial stewardship (AS)may decrease time to administration of narrower antibiotics. Methods: This was a prospective, nonblinded, randomized trial evaluating the impact of a phenotypicrAST method vs conventional AST (cAST) in hospitalized patients with GN-BSI andsource control. The primary outcome was time to narrowest effective therapy.Results: Two hundred seventy-four patients were randomized and 205 underwentanalysis (97 cAST, 108 rAST). Median (interquartile range [IQR]) time tosusceptibility results was 23 hours shorter in the rAST group (cAST: 62 [59-67]hours vs rAST: 39 [IQR, 35-46] hours; P < .001). Median (IQR) time to narrowesteffective therapy was similar between groups (cAST: 73 [44-138] hours vs rAST: 64[42-92] hours; P = .10). Median (IQR) time to narrowest effective therapy wassignificantly shorter in a prespecified subgroup of patients not initially onnarrowest therapy and during AS working hours (cAST: 93 [56-154] hours vs rAST:62 [43-164] hours; P = .004). Significant decreases were observed in median (IQR)time to oral therapy (cAST: 126 [76-209] hours vs rAST: 91 [66-154] hours; P =.02) and median (IQR) length of hospital stay (cAST: 7 [4-13] days vs rAST: 5[4-8] days; P = .04). Conclusions: In patients with GN-BSI, rAST did notsignificantly decrease time to narrowest effective therapy but did decrease time to oral antibiotics and length of hospital stay. Rapid AST using existingmicrobiology platforms has potential to optimize patient outcomes.

TI  - COVID-19 vaccine humoral response in frequent platelet donors withplateletpheresis-associated lymphopenia.
LID - 10.1111/trf.17037 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plateletpheresis involves platelet separation and collection fromwhole blood while other blood cells are returned to the donor. Because platelets are replaced faster than red blood cells, as many as 24 donations can be doneannually. However, some frequent apheresis platelet donors (>20 donationsannually) display severe plateletpheresis-associated lymphopenia; in particular, CD4(+) T but not B cell numbers are decreased. COVID-19 vaccination therebyprovides a model to assess whether lymphopenic platelet donors presentcompromised humoral immune responses. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessedvaccine responses following 2 doses of COVID-19 vaccination in a cohort of 43plateletpheresis donors with a range of pre-vaccination CD4(+) T cell counts(76-1537 cells/mul). In addition to baseline T cell measurements, antibodybinding assays to full-length Spike and the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) wereperformed pre- and post-vaccination. Furthermore, pseudo-particle neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assays were conducted to measureantibody functionality. RESULTS: Participants were stratified into two groups:<400 CD4/mul (n = 27) and >/= 400 CD4/mul (n = 16). Following the first dose, 79%seroconverted within the <400 CD4/mul group compared to 87% in the >/=400 CD4/mulgroup; all donors were seropositive post-second dose with significant increasesin antibody levels. Importantly differences in CD4(+) T cell levels minimallyimpacted neutralization, Spike recognition, and IgG Fc-mediated effectorfunctions. DISCUSSION: Overall, our results indicate that lymphopenicplateletpheresis donors do not exhibit significant immune dysfunction; they have retained the T and B cell functionality necessary for potent antibody responsesafter vaccination.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the efficacy of the addition of polymyxin E (colistin) in the McCarey-Kaufman (MK) corneal storage solution against multi-drug resistantstrains of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida spp. Methods: Astandard micro broth dilution test and a checkerboard assay were performed forfive multi-drug resistant (MDR) clinical strains of P. aeruginosa and fiveclinical strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and C. albicansagainst colistin and gentamicin alone and in combination. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) werecalculated to assess the efficacy of each combination. Results: The MIC ofcolistin was in the range of 1-2 mug/mL for P. aeruginosa, whereas it was256-1024 mug/mL against S. aureus. In comparison, the MIC of gentamicin was foundto be 0.5-512 mug/mL and 0.5-8 mug/mL against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus,respectively. All five isolates of C. albicans did not exhibit any susceptibilityto either colistin or gentamicin even at a concentration of >/= 512 mug/mL each. The checkerboard assay was performed to evaluate the nature of the interaction ofthe combination of colistin and gentamicin. Based on the FICI, it was observedthat the colistin and gentamicin combination has a maximum synergistic effect(FIC <0.5) in 80% (4/5) for S. aureus isolates, whereas the maximum additiveeffect (FIC >0.5-4) was 100% (5/5) for P. aeruginosa and the minimum additiveeffect was 20% (1/5) for S. aureus isolates. Antagonism (FIC >/= 4) was notobserved in any combination between the strains used in the study. Both colistin and gentamicin alone or in combination were, however, ineffective against Candidaspp. Conclusion: The addition of colistin has an inhibitory effect on bacterialcontamination that could be possibly caused by MDR strains and could potentially be considered as an additional additive in corneal storage media.

AB  - Plant polysaccharides have prebiotic properties for gut microbiota and immunemodulation. This study aimed to investigate the prevention abilities of edibleRhinacanthus nasutus polysaccharide (RNP) and okara polysaccharide (OP) inSprague-Dawley rats with acetic acid-induced colitis. The characterizations ofRNP and OP were analyzed, including Fourier transform infrared, thermogravimetricanalysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and monosaccharide composition. The prebiotic properties of RNP and OP were determined in vitro. In addition, thepathological features of colon length and inflammatory cytokine levels in acetic acid-induced colitis were improved by intragastric preadministration of RNP andOP for 3 weeks. There was no nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity in rats viahistopathological assessment after RNP and OP intake. Moreover, the abundance of short-chain fatty acids-producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae, Lactobacilli, andPrevotellaceae) were increased after RNP supplementation. In conclusion,intragastric gavage of RNP and OP significantly modulated the gut microbiota and immune response, consequently alleviating the symptoms of colitis. This novelfinding provides an alternative strategy and potential application of these twopolysaccharides for colitis prevention and treatment.

AB  - The development of natural-based wound dressings is of great interest in thefield of skin tissue engineering. Herein, different bioactive molecules such asgelatin (GEL), chitosan (CH) and mucilage (MU) were used to prepare a wounddressing. The physico-chemical and biological characterizations occurring aftergamma-irradiation were investigated. Results showed that Electron ParamagneticResonance (EPR) spectroscopy of un-irradiated GEL-CH-MU biomaterial showed twoparamagnetic centers which correspond to g = 1.89 and g = 2.033. A generated new active center appeared at g = 2.003 at 25 kGy due to the interactions of gammarays with the polymer chain creating signals at the absorbing functional groups. X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra preserved the semi-crystalline structures betweena range of 2theta (5 degrees and 45 degrees ). Fourier Transform Infraredspectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that the initiation of cross linking phenomena.Moreover, gamma-rays significantly increased antioxidant activity (9.1 +/- 0.07%,p < 0.05) and exhibited a high anti-inflammatory activity (70%) at 25 kGy.Significant antibacterial activities in vitro liquid medium was observed. Inaddition GEL-CH-MU dressing exhibited high hemocompatibility. Conductedinvestigations state that such innovative dressing natural-based polymers foradvanced wound care may be considered as useful for biomedical purposes.

AB  - The increasing complexity of wound care in pediatric patients along with delay inthe initiation of treatment predisposes these patients to many complications suchas pressure ulcers, non-healing surgical wounds and skin damage. A retrospective study was conducted over a period of five years to gain insight into the etiologyof pediatric wound infection. A total of 2819 wound culture positive cases wereincluded. Most samples were from the burn ward (30.15%) followed by the generalsurgery ward (20.46%). Overall, the most common isolate was Staphylococcus aureus(39.73%) followed by Pseudomonas spp (19.12%). The prevalence of MRSA(Methicillin resistant S. aureus), CRE (Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae),CRP (Carbapenem resistant Pseudomonas), CRAB (Carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii) was 47.3%, 62.5%, 70.5%, 96.4%, respectively. The high degree ofresistance in children highlights the importance of regular surveillance foridentification of common pathogens and optimization of antimicrobial treatmentfor multidrug resistant organisms.

TI  - PEDOT:PSS in Solution Form Exhibits Strong Potential in Inhibiting SARS-CoV-2Infection of the Host Cells by Targeting Viruses and Also the Host Cells.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biomac.2c00271 [doi]
AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a global pandemic with over 5 million fatalities. Vaccines against this virus have beenglobally administered; however, SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein mutations are continuously identified with strong capability to escape vaccine-elicitedprotection. Due to the high mutation rate and transmission ability, thedevelopment of a broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor is highly in demand. In thisstudy, the effect of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS) against SARS-CoV-2 was investigated. The treatment of pseudovirusescarrying the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with PEDOT:PSS strongly blocked SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in human ACE2-expressing cells without causingcytotoxicity. Specifically, PEDOT:PSS showed great potential in both inactivatingviruses and rendering antiviral activity to the treated cells. The effects ofother PEDOT:PSS solutions with different chemical ratios and properties were alsovalidated to find the high inhibition capacity against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirusinfection. The transcriptomic data reveal that PEDOT:PSS-treated cells wereendowed with transcriptional alteration, and it could be reverted after theremoval of PEDOT:PSS from the culture medium. Importantly, PEDOT:PSS alsoexhibited broad-spectrum inhibition effects on the pseudovirus carrying the spikeprotein isolated from different variants. In combination with the advantage ofhigh biocompatibility, PEDOT:PSS could thus be considered a potential therapeuticand prophylactic material against SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Rhinovirus (RV)-specific surveillance studies in the Middle East are limited. Therefore, we aimed to study the clinical characteristics, outcomes, andseasonality of RV-associated acute respiratory infection among hospitalized youngchildren in Jordan. METHODS: We conducted a prospective viral surveillance study and enrolled children <2 years old admitted to a large public hospital in Amman, Jordan (2010-2013). Demographic and clinical data were collected by structuredinterviews and chart abstractions. Nasal and/or throat swabs were collected andtested for a panel of respiratory viruses, and RV genotyping and speciation wasperformed. RESULTS: At least one virus was detected in 2,641/3,168 children(83.4%). RV was the second most common virus detected (n=1,238; 46.9%) and wasco-detected with another respiratory virus in 730 cases (59.0%). Children with RVco-detection were more likely than those with RV-only detection to haverespiratory distress but had similar outcomes. RV-A accounted for about half ofRV-positive cases (54.7%), while children with RV-C had a higher frequency ofwheezing and reactive airway disease. RV was detected year-round and peakedduring winter. CONCLUSIONS: Though children with RV co-detection had worseclinical findings, neither co-detection nor species affected most clinicaloutcomes. This article is protected by copyright.

AB  - RATIONALE: Early corticosteroid treatment is used to treat COVID-19-related acuterespiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Infection is a well-documented adverseeffect of corticosteroid therapy. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether earlycorticosteroid therapy to treat COVID-19 ARDS was associated withventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: We retrospectively includedadults with COVID-19-ARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) for >/= 48 h at any of 15 intensive care units in 2020. We divided the patients into two groups based on whether they did or did not receive corticosteroids within 24 h. The primary outcome was VAP incidence, with death and extubation as competingevents. Secondary outcomes were day 90-mortality, MV duration, other organdysfunctions, and VAP characteristics. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 670patients (mean age, 65 years), 369 did and 301 did not receive earlycorticosteroids. The cumulative VAP incidence was higher with earlycorticosteroids (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.29; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.05-1.58; P = 0.016). Antibiotic resistance of VAP bacteria was notdifferent between the two groups (odds ratio 0.94, 95% CI 0.58-1.53; P = 0.81).90-day mortality was 30.9% with and 24.3% without early corticosteroids, anonsignificant difference after adjustment on age, SOFA score, and VAP occurrence(aHR 1.15; 95% CI 0.83-1.60; P = 0.411). VAP was associated with higher 90-daymortality (aHR 1.86; 95% CI 1.33-2.61; P = 0.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Earlycorticosteroid treatment was associated with VAP in patients with COVID-19-ARDS. Although VAP was associated with higher 90-day mortality, early corticosteroidtreatment was not. Longitudinal randomized controlled trials of earlycorticosteroids in COVID-19-ARDS requiring MV are warranted.

TI  - Prenatal vitamin intake in first month of pregnancy and DNA methylation in cordblood and placenta in two prospective cohorts.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s13072-022-00460-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal vitamin use is recommended before and during pregnancies fornormal fetal development. Prenatal vitamins do not have a standard formulation,but many contain calcium, folic acid, iodine, iron, omega-3 fatty acids, zinc,and vitamins A, B6, B12, and D, and usually they contain higher concentrations offolic acid and iron than regular multivitamins in the US Nutrient levels canimpact epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation, but relationships betweenmaternal prenatal vitamin use and DNA methylation have been relativelyunderstudied. We examined use of prenatal vitamins in the first month ofpregnancy in relation to cord blood and placenta DNA methylation in twoprospective pregnancy cohorts: the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation(EARLI) and Markers of Autism Risk Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) studies.RESULTS: In placenta, prenatal vitamin intake was marginally associated with-0.52% (95% CI -1.04, 0.01) lower mean array-wide DNA methylation in EARLI, andassociated with -0.60% (-1.08, -0.13) lower mean array-wide DNA methylation inMARBLES. There was little consistency in the associations between prenatalvitamin intake and single DNA methylation site effect estimates across cohortsand tissues, with only a few overlapping sites with correlated effect estimates. However, the single DNA methylation sites with p-value < 0.01 (EARLI cord nCpGs =4068, EARLI placenta nCpGs = 3647, MARBLES cord nCpGs = 4068, MARBLES placentanCpGs = 9563) were consistently enriched in neuronal developmental pathways.CONCLUSIONS: Together, our findings suggest that prenatal vitamin intake in thefirst month of pregnancy may be related to lower placental global DNA methylationand related to DNA methylation in brain-related pathways in both placenta andcord blood.

TI  - Toxoplasma gondii dense granule protein 3 promotes endoplasmic reticulumstress-induced apoptosis by activating the PERK pathway.
PG  - 276
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05394-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Toxoplasma gondii is a neurotropic single-celled parasite that caninfect mammals, including humans. Central nervous system infection with T. gondiiinfection can lead to Toxoplasma encephalitis. Toxoplasma infection can causeendoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) activation,which ultimately can lead to apoptosis of host cells. The dense granule proteinGRA3 has been identified as one of the secretory proteins that contribute to the virulence of T. gondii; however, the mechanism remains enigmatic. METHODS: Theexpression of the GRA3 gene in RH, ME49, Wh3, and Wh6 strains was determinedusing quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). pEGFP-GRA3Wh6was constructed by inserting Chinese 1 Wh6 GRA3 (GRA3Wh6) cDNA into a plasmidencoding the enhanced GFP. Mouse neuro2a (N2a) cells were transfected with eitherpEGFP or pEGFP-GRA3Wh6 (GRA3Wh6) and incubated for 24-36 h. N2a cell apoptosisand ER stress-associated proteins were determined using flow cytometry andimmunoblotting. Furthermore, N2a cells were pretreated with GSK2656157 (a PERKinhibitor) and Z-ATAD-FMK (a caspase-12 inhibitor) before GRA3Wh6 transfection,and the effect of the inhibitors on GRA3Wh6-induced ER stress and apoptosis were investigated. RESULTS: GRA3 gene expression was higher in the less virulentstrains of type II ME49 and type Chinese 1 Wh6 strains compared with the virulentstrains of type I RH strain and type Chinese 1 Wh3 strain. Transfection withGRA3Wh6 plasmid induced neuronal apoptosis and increased the expression of GRP78,p-PERK, cleaved caspase-12, cleaved caspase-3, and CHOP compared with the controlvector. Pretreatment with GSK2656157 and Z-ATAD-FMK decreased apoptosis in N2acells, and similarly, ER stress- and apoptosis-associated protein levels weresignificantly decreased. CONCLUSION: GRA3 induces neural cell apoptosis via theER stress signaling pathway, which could play a role in toxoplasmic encephalitis.

PG  - 986
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-08329-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Notification of laboratory-determined critical values is key foreffective clinical decision making and is thus a consequential step in apatient's health care and safety. This study presents an overview of staffreporting policies and procedures concerning critical values in Kuwaitigovernmental hospitals. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study design wasadopted. Study subjects were affiliated with laboratories from five governmenthospitals (four general and one sub-specialty hospital). All laboratory staff in every hospital were included. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences(version 23) was used to analyse the collected data at a significance level of</= 0.05. Quantitative data analysis included univariate descriptive (means,medians, standard deviations, frequencies, percentages) and bivariate(chi-squared, ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests) analyses. These analyses providedassociations between participating hospitals and staff perceptions towards thepolicies and procedures surrounding critical values. RESULTS: 559 questionnaires were returned, a total response of 30.5% after those of 79 phlebotomists wereexcluded (eligible sample size n = 1833). The notification of critical valuesdiffers between participated laboratories in delivering protocol and timeduration. Linked protocols between laboratories did not exist regarding policies and guidelines for applying the same procedures for critical value notification. There are differences in critical value limits among the participatinglaboratories. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to survey laboratory staffperceptions of critical value practices in Kuwaiti government hospitals.Enhancing critical value reporting and policy is crucial for improving patientsafety and to develop high-quality health services. The findings of this studycan help policy makers implement future intervention studies to enhancelaboratory practices in the area of critical values and improve patient safetyand the quality of government hospital systems.

AB  - Despite the known influence of continuous cropping on soil microorganisms, littleis known about the associated difference in the effects of continuous cropping onthe community compositions of soil bacteria and fungi. Here, we assessed soilphysicochemical property, as well as bacterial and fungal compositions acrossdifferent years (Uncropped control, 1, 6, 11, 16, and 21 years) and in thewatermelon system of a gravel mulch field in the Loess Plateau of China. Ourresults showed that long-term continuous cropping led to substantial shifts insoil bacterial and fungal compositions. The relative abundances of dominantbacterial and fungal genera (average relative abundance > 1.0%) significantlyvaried among different continuous cropping years (P < 0.05). Structural equation models demonstrated that continuous cropping alter soil bacterial and fungalcompositions mainly by causing substantial variations in soil attributes.Variations in soil pH, nutrient, salinity, and moisture content jointly explained73% and 64% of the variation in soil bacterial and fungal compositions,respectively. Variations in soil moisture content and pH caused by continuouscropping drove the shifts in soil bacterial and fungal compositions, respectively(Mantel R = 0.74 and 0.54, P < 0.01). Furthermore, the variation in soilbacterial and fungal composition showed significant correlation with watermelonyield reduction (P < 0.01). Together, long-term continuous cropping can altersoil microbial composition, and thereby influencing watermelon yield. Ourfindings are useful for alleviating continuous cropping obstacles and guidingagricultural production.

AB  - BACKGROUND: DIRs are mysterious protein that have the ability to scavenge freeradicals, which, are highly reactive with molecules in their vicinity. What iseven more fascinating is that they carry out from these highly unstable species, a selective reaction (i.e., stereoenantioselective) from a well-defined substrateto give a very precise product. Unfortunately, to date, only three products have been demonstrated following studies on DIRs from the plant world, which until nowwas the kingdom where these proteins had been demonstrated. Within this kingdom, each DIR protein has its own type of substrate. The products identified to date, have on the other hand, a strong economic impact: in agriculture for example, thebiosynthesis of (+)-gossypol could be highlighted (a repellent antifood produced by the cotton plant) by the DIRs of cotton. In forsythia plant species, it is thebiosynthesis of (-)-pinoresinol, an intermediate leading to the synthesis ofpodophyllotoxine (a powerful anicancerous agent) which has been revealed.Recently, a clear path of study, potentially with strong impact, appeared by the hypothesis of the potential existence of protein DIR within the genomes ofprokaryotes. The possibility of working with this type of organism is anundeniable advantage: since many sequenced genomes are available and themolecular tools are already developed. Even easier to implement and working onmicrobes, of less complex composition, offers many opportunities for laboratorystudies. On the other hand, the diversity of their environment (e.g., soil,aquatic environments, extreme environmental conditions (pH, temperature,pressure) make them very diverse and varied subjects of study. Identifying newDIR proteins from bacteria means identifying new substrate or product moleculesfrom these organisms. It is the promise of going further in understanding themechanism of action of these proteins and this will most likely have a strongimpact in the fields of agricultural, pharmaceutical and/or food chemistry.RESULTS: Our goal is to obtain as much information as possible about theseproteins to unlock the secrets of their exceptional functioning. Analyzes ofstructural and functional genomic data led to the identification of the PfamPF03018 domain as characteristic of DIR proteins. This domain has been furtheridentified in the sequence of bacterial proteins therefore named as DIR-like(DIRL). We have chosen a multidisciplinary bioinformatic approach centered onbacterial genome identification, gene expression and regulation signals, protein structures, and their molecular information content. The objective of this study was to perform a thorough bioinformatic analysis on these DIRLs to highlight any information leading to the selection of candidate bacteria for further cloning,purification, and characterization of bacterial DIRs. CONCLUSIONS: From studiesof DIRL genes identification, primary structures, predictions of their secondary and tertiary structures, prediction of DIRL signals sequences, analysis of their gene organization and potential regulation, a list of primary bacterialcandidates is proposed.

TI  - Comparative genomics of Leuconostoc lactis strains isolated from humangastrointestinal system and fermented foods microbiomes.
PG  - 61
LID - 10.1186/s12863-022-01074-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Leuconostoc lactis forms a crucial member of the genus Leuconostocand has been widely used in the fermentation industry to convert raw materialinto acidified and flavored products in dairy and plant-based food systems. Sincethe ecological niches that strains of Ln. lactis being isolated from were trulydiverse such as the human gut, dairy, and plant environments, comparative genome analysis studies are needed to better understand the strain differences from ametabolic adaptation point of view across diverse sources of origin. We compared eight Ln. lactis strains of 1.2.28, aa_0143, BIOML-A1, CBA3625, LN19, LN24,WIKIM21, and WiKim40 using bioinformatics to elucidate genomic levelcharacteristics of each strain for better utilization of this species in a broad range of applications in food industry. RESULTS: Phylogenomic analysis oftwenty-nine Ln. lactis strains resulted in nine clades. Whole-genome sequenceanalysis was performed on eight Ln. lactis strains representing humangastrointestinal tract and fermented foods microbiomes. The findings of thepresent study are based on comparative genome analysis against the reference Ln. lactis CBA3625 genome. Overall, a ~ 41% of all CDS were conserved between allstrains. When the coding sequences were assigned to a function, mobile geneticelements, mainly insertion sequences were carried by all eight strains. Allstrains except LN24 and WiKim40 harbor at least one intact putative prophageregion, and two of the strains contained CRISPR-Cas system. All strains encodedLactococcin 972 bacteriocin biosynthesis gene clusters except for CBA3625.CONCLUSIONS: The findings in the present study put forth new perspectives ongenomics of Ln. lactis via complete genome sequence based comparative analysisand further determination of genomic characteristics. The outcomes of this workcould potentially pave the way for developing elements for future strainengineering applications.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance of airborne bacterial populations in a hospitalenvironment.
PG  - 629
LID - 10.1007/s10661-022-10291-6 [doi]
AB  - Bacteria in a hospital environment potentially cause hospital-acquired infections(HAIs), particularly in immunocompromised individuals. Treatments of HAIs withantibiotics, however, are ineffective due to the emergence ofantibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). This study aims to identify airbornebacteria in a tertiary hospital in Malaysia and screen for their resistance tocommonly used broad-spectrum antibiotics. Airborne bacteria were sampled usingactive sampling at the respiratory ward (RW), physician clinic (PC) and emergencydepartment (ED). Physical parameters of the areas were recorded, following theIndustry Code of Practice on Indoor Air Quality 2010 (ICOP IAQ 2010). Bacterialidentification was based on morphological and biochemical tests. Antibioticresistance screening was carried out using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method.Results showed that the highest bacterial population was found in the highestdensity occupancy area, PC (1024 +/- 54 CFU/m(3)), and exceeded the acceptablelimit. Micrococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus, alpha- and beta-Streptococcusspp., Bacillus spp. and Clostridium spp. colonies were identified at the samplinglocations. The antibiotic resistance screening showed a vast percentage ofresistance amongst the bacterial colonies, with resistance to ampicillin observedas the highest percentage (Micrococcus spp.: 95.2%, S. aureus: 100%,Streptococcus spp.: 75%, Bacillus spp.: 100% and Clostridium spp.: 100%). Thisstudy provides awareness to healthcare practitioners and the public on the statusof the emergence of ARB in a hospital environment. Early detection of bacterialpopulations and good management of hospital environments are important preventionmeasures for HAI.

TI  - GPM6A expression is suppressed in hepatocellular carcinoma through miRNA-96production.
LID - 10.1038/s41374-022-00818-3 [doi]
AB  - GPM6A is a glycoprotein in endothelial cells, and its biological function in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. Through Affymetrix geneexpression microarray and bioinformatic analysis, very low GPM6A expression wasfound in HCC tissue. The present study aims to explore the function andregulatory mechanism of GPM6A in HCC development and progression. Levels of GPM6Aexpression in HCC specimens from different disorders and various hepatoma celllines were determined, and its role on cell proliferation was evaluated inhepatoma cells stably overexpressing GPM6A. Modulation of a specific microRNA(miRNA) on its expression and function was evaluated with miRNA mimetictransfection. Herein, it is reported that much lower GPM6A levels were found inHCC tissues than pericancerous liver tissues and correlated to a poor prognosis. GPM6A overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, suppressed colony formation,migration and invasion in two hepatoma cell types. Available evidence does notsupport that genetic and epigenetic dysregulation contributes significantly toGPM6A inactivation in HCC. Additional findings demonstrated that miR-96-5p acted directly on the 3'-UTR of the GPM6A gene and significantly decreased its mRNA andprotein levels. MiR-96-5p transfection promoted proliferation, migration andinvasion of SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H hepatoma cells; whereas the function ofoncogenic microRNA-96 was significantly inhibited in GPM6A-overexpressed hepatomacells. In conclusion, GPM6A expression in HCC is commonly suppressed regardlessits base disease types, and its low expression in HCC tissues is most likelyattributed to upregulated miR-96-5p. GPM6A may function as a valuable biomarkerfor HCC progression and prognosis.

TI  - Expression pattern and clinical significance of beta 2-adrenergic receptor inoral squamous cell carcinoma: an emerging prognostic indicator and futuretherapeutic target.
LID - 10.1007/s12094-022-02879-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Beta 2-Adrenergic Receptor (beta2-AR) is significantly overexpressed in various types of malignancies, which is associated with the worst prognosis.However, the role of beta2-AR in oral cancer is not well identified. The present study aimed at investigating the beta2-AR gene expression and its significance inrelation with the clinicopathological features and overall survival of oralsquamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry, westernblot and quantitative real-time PCR techniques were used to analyze beta2-ARprotein and mRNA levels in a total of 65 histopathologically confirmed OSCCtissues (case group) and 65 normal tissues (control group) from the oral cavity. RESULTS: Out of the total of 65 OSCC tissues, 41 tissues (63.1%) exhibited highexpression for beta2-AR protein. Percent positivity and relative density (mean+/- SD) of protein were higher in the case group as compared to the control group(positivity 40.31 +/- 3.01 vs. 20.46 +/- 1.93, p < 0.001; density 2.77 +/- 1.17vs. 1.28 +/- 0.37, p < 0.001). In addition, beta2-AR mRNA level was alsoupregulated in patients compared to the controls (2.36 +/- 1.30 vs. 1.09 +/-0.42, p < 0.001) and showed a positive correlation with immunostaining of proteinin OSCC (r = 0.48, p = 0.011). High beta2-AR protein expression was significantlyassociated with multiple risk habits (p = 0.045), histological differentiation (p= 0.013), clinical TNM stages (p = 0.014), and poor survival (p = 0.006) ofpatients. In the Cox proportional hazards model, beta2-AR was identified as aprognostic biomarker of OSCC (p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: beta2-AR protein level isidentified as an independent significant prognostic factor in patients with oral carcinoma.

TI  - Alterations in soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid profile with soil depthfollowing cropland conversion in karst region, southwest China.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-22178-7 [doi]
AB  - The soil microbial community is a key indicator used to evaluate theeffectiveness of land use changes in degraded ecosystems. However, there iscurrently limited information on the vertical variations of soil microbialcommunities under different cropland types in the karst region of southwestChina. In this study, three different cropland types (sugarcane, mulberry, andforage grass) were selected to replace maize-soybean cultivation in a karst area of southwest China. Secondary forest was included for comparison. Soil wascollected at soil depths of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm, and 30-50 cm to conduct a phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis of the soil microbial communities. The results showed that the abundances of total PLFAs and PLFAs of bacteria, fungi,actinomycetes, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi were significantly higher inforage grass cultivation and secondary forest areas than those in other threecropland types. The abundance of total PLFA and its functional groupssignificantly decreased with increasing soil depth. Bacteria was the predominant community (> 52%) across all land use types and soil depths. A principalcomponent analysis indicated that soil microbial PLFA composition in forage grassfield and secondary forest areas differed significantly from that in mulberry,sugarcane, and maize-soybean fields across 0-50-cm soil layer. Soil organiccarbon was identified as the primary factor affecting the abundance and structureof soil microbial communities in the four soil layers. These results suggest thatgreater improvements in soil quality and fertility could be made by replacing themaize-soybean rotation system with forage grass cultivation than by replacing it with mulberry or sugarcane cultivation in the karst region of southwest China.

AB  - Biodegradation of high-molecular-weight petroleum hydrocarbons in salineconditions appears to be complicated and requires further investigation. Thisstudy used heavy crude oil to enrich petroleum-degrading bacteria fromoil-contaminated saline soils. Strain HG 01, with 100% sequence similarity toBacillus subtilis, grew at a wide range of salinities and degraded 55.5 and 77.2%of 500 mg/l pyrene and 500 mg/l tetracosane, respectively, at 5% w/v NaCl.Additionally, a mixed-culture of HG 01 with Pseudomonas putida and Pseudomonasaeruginosa, named TMC, increased the yield of pyrene, and tetracosane degradationby about 20%. Replacing minimal medium with treated seawater (C/N/P adjusted to100/10/1) enabled TMC to degrade more than 99% of pyrene and tetracosane, but TMChad lesser degradation in untreated seawater than in minimal medium. Also, thedegradation kinetics of pyrene and tetracosane were fitted to a first-ordermodel. Compared to B. subtilis, TMC increased pyrene and tetracosane's removalrate constant (K1) from 0.063 and 0.110 per day to 0.123 and 0.246 per day. TMCalso increased the maximum specific growth rate of B. subtilis, P. putida, and P.aeruginosa, respectively, 45% higher in pyrene, 24.5% in tetracosane, and 123.4% and 95.4% higher in pyrene and tetracosane.

AB  - PILRA (rs1859788 A > G) has been suggested to be a protective variant forAlzheimer's disease (AD) and is an entry co-receptor for herpes simplex virus-1. We conducted a nested case-control study of 360 1:1-matched AD subjects.Interactions between the PILRA-A allele, APOE risk variants (epsilon3/epsilon4 orepsilon4/epsilon4) and GM17 for AD risk were modelled. The associations werecross-validated using two independent whole-genome sequencing datasets. We found negative interactions between PILRA-A and GM17 (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.52-1.00) andbetween PILRA-A and APOE risk variants (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.98) in thediscovery dataset. In the replication cohort, a joint effect of PILRA and PILRA xGM 17/17 was observed for the risk of developing AD (p .02). Here, we report anegative effect modification by PILRA on APOE and GM17 high-risk variants forfuture AD risk in two independent datasets. This highlights the complex genetics of AD.

TI  - Distinct Denitrifying Phenotypes of Predominant Bacteria Modulate Nitrous OxideMetabolism in Two Typical Cropland Soils.
LID - 10.1007/s00248-022-02085-7 [doi]
AB  - Denitrifying nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in agroecosystems result fromvariations in microbial composition and soil properties. However, the microbialmechanisms of differential N2O emissions in agricultural soils are lessunderstood. In this study, microcosm experiments using two main types of Chinese cropland soil were conducted with different supplements of nitrate and glucose tosimulate the varying nitrogen and carbon conditions. The results show that N2Oaccumulation in black soil (BF) was significantly higher than that in fluvo-aquicsoil (FF) independent of nitrogen and carbon. The abundance of most denitrifying genes was significantly higher in FF, but the ratios of genes responsible for N2Oproduction (nirS and nirK) to the gene responsible for N2O reduction (nosZ) didnot significantly differ between the two soils. However, the soils showed obviousdiscrepancies in denitrifying bacterial communities, with a higher abundance ofN2O-generating bacteria in BF and a higher abundance of N2O-reducing bacteria in FF. High accumulation of N2O was verified by the bacterial isolates ofRhodanobacter predominated in BF due to a lack of N2O reduction capacity. Thedominance of Castellaniella and others in FF led to a rapid reduction in N2O and thus less N2O accumulation, as demonstrated when the corresponding isolate wasinoculated into the studied soils. Therefore, the different phenotypes of N2Ometabolism of the distinct denitrifiers predominantly colonized the two soils,causing differing N2O accumulation. This knowledge would help to develop astrategy for mitigating N2O emissions in agricultural soils by regulating thephenotypes of N2O metabolism.

LID - 10.1038/s41564-022-01183-z [doi]
AB  - Cryptococcus neoformans infections cause approximately 15% of AIDS-related deathsowing to a combination of limited antifungal therapies and drug resistance. Acollection of clinical and environmental C. neoformans isolates were assayed for increased mutation rates via fluctuation analysis, and we identified twohypermutator C. neoformans clinical isolates with increased mutation rates whenexposed to the combination of rapamycin and FK506. Sequencing of drug targetgenes found that Cnl1 transposon insertions conferred the majority of resistance to rapamycin and FK506 and could also independently cause resistance to5-fluoroorotic acid and the clinically relevant antifungal 5-flucytosine.Whole-genome sequencing revealed both hypermutator genomes harbour a nonsensemutation in the RNA-interference component ZNF3 and hundreds of Cnl1 elementsorganized into massive subtelomeric arrays on each of the fourteen chromosomes.Quantitative trait locus mapping in 28 progeny derived from a cross between ahypermutator and wild-type identified a locus associated with hypermutation that included znf3. CRISPR editing of the znf3 nonsense mutation abolishedhypermutation and restored small-interfering-RNA production. We conclude thathypermutation and drug resistance in these clinical isolates result fromRNA-interference loss and accumulation of Cnl1 elements.

TI  - Viral biogeography of the mammalian gut and parenchymal organs.
LID - 10.1038/s41564-022-01178-w [doi]
AB  - The mammalian virome has been linked to health and disease but our understanding of how it is structured along the longitudinal axis of the mammaliangastrointestinal tract (GIT) and other organs is limited. Here, we report ametagenomic analysis of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic virome occupying luminaland mucosa-associated habitats along the GIT, as well as parenchymal organs(liver, lung and spleen), in two representative mammalian species, the domesticpig and rhesus macaque (six animals per species). Luminal samples from the large intestine of both mammals harboured the highest loads and diversity ofbacteriophages (class Caudoviricetes, family Microviridae and others). Mucosalsamples contained much lower viral loads but a higher proportion of eukaryoticviruses (families Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae). Parenchymal organs contained bacteriophages of gut origin, in addition to some eukaryotic viruses.Overall, GIT virome composition was specific to anatomical region and hostspecies. Upper GIT and mucosa-specific viruses were greatly under-represented in distal colon samples (a proxy for faeces). Nonetheless, certain viral and phagespecies were ubiquitous in all samples from the oral cavity to the distal colon. The dataset and its accompanying methodology may provide an important resourcefor future work investigating the biogeography of the mammalian gut virome.

TI  - Outbreak dynamics of foodborne pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus over a seventeen year period implies hidden reservoirs.
LID - 10.1038/s41564-022-01182-0 [doi]
AB  - Controlling foodborne diseases requires robust outbreak detection and acomprehensive understanding of outbreak dynamics. Here, by integratinglarge-scale phylogenomic analysis of 3,642 isolates and epidemiological data, we performed 'data-driven' outbreak detection and described the long-term outbreakdynamics of the leading seafood-associated pathogen, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, in Shenzhen, China, over a 17-year period. Contradictory to the widely acceptednotion that sporadic patients and independent point-source outbreaks dominatedfoodborne infections, we found that 71% of isolates from patients grouped intowithin-1-month clusters that differed by </=6 single nucleotide polymorphisms,indicating putative outbreaks. Furthermore, we showed that despite the long time spans between clusters, 70% of them were genomically closely related and wereinferred to arise from a small number of common sources, which provides evidence that hidden persistent reservoirs generated most of the outbreaks rather thanindependent point-sources. Phylogeographical analysis further revealed thegeographical heterogeneity of outbreaks and identified a coastal district as the potential hotspot of outbreaks and as the hub and major source of cross-district spread events. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the long-termspatiotemporal dynamics of foodborne outbreaks and present a differentperspective on the major source of foodborne infections, which will inform thedesign of future disease control strategies.

TI  - Trafficked Malayan pangolins contain viral pathogens of humans.
LID - 10.1038/s41564-022-01181-1 [doi]
AB  - Pangolins are the most trafficked wild animal in the world according to the WorldWildlife Fund. The discovery of SARS-CoV-2-related coronaviruses in Malayanpangolins has piqued interest in the viromes of these wild, scaly-skinnedmammals. We sequenced the viromes of 161 pangolins that were smuggled into China and assembled 28 vertebrate-associated viruses, 21 of which have not beenpreviously reported in vertebrates. We named 16 members of Hunnivirus, Pestivirusand Copiparvovirus pangolin-associated viruses. We report that the L-protein has been lost from all hunniviruses identified in pangolins. Sequences of fourhuman-associated viruses were detected in pangolin viromes, including respiratorysyncytial virus, Orthopneumovirus, Rotavirus A and Mammalian orthoreovirus. Thegenomic sequences of five mammal-associated and three tick-associated viruseswere also present. Notably, a coronavirus related to HKU4-CoV, which wasoriginally found in bats, was identified. The presence of these viruses insmuggled pangolins identifies these mammals as a potential source of emergentpathogenic viruses.

AB  - Periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory condition that can damage soft tissuesand supporting teeth. Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen usually living in the oral cavity and plays a critical role in apical periodontitis that significantly threatens human health. The use of bacteriophages as an alternativeway to eliminate bacterial infections is a promising approach. E. faecalis wasisolated from the depth of dental packets of patients with periodontitis.Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using 16 antimicrobial agents. Also, aspecific virulent bacteriophage (vB_EfaS-SRH2) with an irregular pentagonalmorphology of the head and a non-contractile tail belonging to the Siphoviridae, was isolated from wastewater in East of Isfahan, Iran, and its physiological and genomic specifications were investigated. The genome was double-strand DNA with38,746 bp length and encoded 62 putative ORFs. In addition, eight Anti-CRISPERsand 30 Rho-dependent terminators were found. No tRNA was found. It had a shortlatent period of 15 min and a large burst size of ~ 125. No undesirable genes(antibiotic resistance, lysogenic dependence, and virulence factors) wereidentified in the genome. Based on physiological properties and genomiccharacteristics, this phage can be used as a suitable choice in phage therapy forperiodontitis and root canal infection.

AB  - Over the past decades, accumulating evidences have highlighted the gut microbiotaas a key player in the brain functioning via microbiota-gut-brain axis, andaccordingly, the beneficial role of several probiotic strains in cognitiveability also have been actively investigated. However, the majority of theresearch have demonstrated the effects against age-related cognitive decline orneurological disease. To this end, we aimed to investigate lactic acid bacteriastrains having beneficial effects on the cognitive function of healthy young miceand elucidate underlying characteristics by carrying out nanoporesequencing-based genomics and metagenomics analysis. 8-week consumption ofStreptococcus thermophilus EG007 demonstrated marked enhancements in behaviortests assessing short-term spatial and non-spatial learning and memory. It wasrevealed that EG007 possessed genes encoding various metabolites beneficial for ahealth condition in many aspects, including gamma-aminobutyric acid producingsystem, a neurotransmitter associated with mood and stress response. Also, byutilizing 16S-23S rRNA operon as a taxonomic marker, we identified more accurate species-level compositional changes in gut microbiota, which was increase ofcertain species, previously reported to have associations with mental health ordown-regulation of inflammation or infection-related species. Moreover,correlation analysis revealed that the EG007-mediated altered microbiota had asignificant correlation with the memory traits.

AB  - Phages are regarded as powerful antagonists of bacteria, especially in industrialfermentation processes involving bacteria. While bacteria have developed various defense mechanisms, most of which are effective against a narrow range of phages and consequently exert limited protection from phage infection. Here, we report astrategy for developing phage-resistant Escherichia coli strains through thesimultaneous genomic integration of a DNA phosphorothioation-based Ssp defensemodule and mutations of components essential for the phage life cycle. Theengineered E. coli strains show strong resistance against diverse phages testedwithout affecting cell growth. Additionally, the resultant engineeredphage-resistant strains maintain the capabilities of producing examplerecombinant proteins, D-amino acid oxidase and coronavirus-encoded nonstructural protein nsp8, even under high levels of phage cocktail challenge. The strategyreported here will be useful for developing engineered E. coli strains withimproved phage resistance for various industrial fermentation processes forproducing recombinant proteins and chemicals of interest.

AB  - Whole-genome recoding has been shown to enable nonstandard amino acids,biocontainment and viral resistance in bacteria. Here we take the first steps to extend this to human cells demonstrating exceptional base editing to convert TAG to TAA for 33 essential genes via a single transfection, and examine base-editinggenome-wide (observing ~40 C-to-T off-target events in essential gene exons). We also introduce GRIT, a computational tool for recoding. This demonstrates thefeasibility of recoding, and highly multiplex editing in mammalian cells.

AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality inchildren, due in part to their distinct immune system, characterized by impaired induction of Th 1 immunity. Here we show application of cationic adjuvantformulation CAF08, a liposomal vaccine formulation tailored to induce Th 1immunity in early life via synergistic engagement of Toll-like Receptor 7/8 andthe C-type lectin receptor Mincle. We apply quantitative phosphoproteomics tohuman dendritic cells and reveal a role for Protein Kinase C-delta for enhancedTh1 cytokine production in neonatal dendritic cells and identify signaling eventsresulting in antigen cross-presentation. In a murine in vivo model a singleimmunization at birth with CAF08-adjuvanted RSV pre-fusion antigen protectsnewborn mice from RSV infection by induction of antigen-specific CD8(+) T-cellsand Th1 cells. Overall, we describe a pediatric adjuvant formulation andcharacterize its mechanism of action providing a promising avenue for developmentof early life vaccines against RSV and other respiratory viral pathogens.

TI  - Spatiotemporal control of engineered bacteria to express interferon-gamma byfocused ultrasound for tumor immunotherapy.

AB  - Bacteria-based tumor therapy has recently attracted wide attentions due to itsunique capability in targeting tumors and preferentially colonizing the core areaof the tumor. Various therapeutic genes are also harbored into these engineering bacteria to enhance their anti-tumor efficacy. However, it is difficult tospatiotemporally control the expression of these inserted genes in the tumorsite. Here, we engineer an ultrasound-responsive bacterium (URB) which can inducethe expression of exogenous genes in an ultrasound-controllable manner. Owing to the advantage of ultrasound in tissue penetration, an acoustic remote control of bacterial gene expression can be realized by designing a temperature-actuatedgenetic switch. Cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), an important immuneregulatory molecule that plays a significant role in tumor immunotherapy, is usedto test the system. Our results show that brief hyperthermia induced by focusedultrasound promotes the expression of IFN-gamma gene, improving anti-tumorefficacy of URB in vitro and in vivo. Our study provides an alternative strategy for bacteria-mediated tumor immunotherapy.

TI  - Comparative transcriptomic adaptations of Staphylococcus aureus to the woundenvironment in non-diabetic and diabetic mice.
LID - 10.1111/wrr.13040 [doi]
AB  - Infection is a major source of complications in delayed diabetic wound healing.Increased understanding of differential bacterial responses to diabetic woundswill enable us to better understand chronic wound pathogenesis. Here we createdelayed-healing wounds infected with Staphylococcus aureus in non-diabetic anddiabetic mice and used RNA-seq to compare bacterial gene expression profiles 3 or7 days after infection. Analysis at day 3 demonstrated substantial transcriptomicdifferences between bacteria colonizing non-diabetic and diabetic wound beds.Most of these transcriptional differences resolved by day 7, suggestingnormalization of many bacterial phenotypes later in the diabetic wound healingprocess. Lingering differentially expressed genes at day 7 were enriched forgenes related to carbohydrate metabolism, which includes genes of the lac operon,and capsular polysaccharide synthesis, which includes the cap8 locus. These data encourage further research into host-pathogen interactions in wound healing andhow they influence differential outcomes in the diabetic wound environment.

TI  - DDX41 expression is associated with tumor necrosis in clear cell renal cellcarcinoma and in cooperation with VHL loss leads to worse prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Histologic tumor necrosis (TN) is a well-established independentprognostic indicator in patients treated surgically for clear cell renal cellcarcinoma (ccRCC). However, the precise mechanisms by which TN alters diseaseprogression remain unknown. The DEAD-box protein DDX41, a member of a largefamily of helicases, has been characterized as a pattern recognition receptoragainst an array of double-stranded (ds)DNA produced from bacteria, dsDNAviruses, and nearby cells that have released dsDNA fragments through necrosis. Wehypothesized that DDX41 expression may be upregulated in ccRCC with TN, leadingto worse prognosis. METHODS: Relationship between the presence of TN and DDX41expression were examined using The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets or using ccRCCsamples in our institution. Further, the molecular functions of DDX41 wereinvestigated with human ccRCC cells. RESULTS: The presence of TN wassignificantly associated with the upregulation of mRNA and protein expression of DDX41 in the 2different patient cohorts with ccRCC. In addition, the mRNA andprotein expression levels of DDX41 revealed a worse prognosis. In vitro analyses with ccRCC cells revealed that DDX41 expression promotes tumor-promotingactivity. Furthermore, VHL loss, 1of the most common features in ccRCC, was shownto play an extremely important role in increasing the expression of the CXCLfamily in DDX41-expressing ccRCC, leading to the acquisition of a worse malignantphenotype. CONCLUSIONS: DDX41 expression is associated with TN in ccRCC and leadsto a worse prognosis in cooperation with VHL loss.

AB  - Vaccination is one of the most powerful strategies for the preventive andtherapeutic control of infectious diseases and other diseases such as cancer. To maximize the effectiveness of vaccines, it is necessary to modify the immuneresponses by means of adjuvants. The gut environment, including commensalbacteria and dietary components, has been proven to be able to mediate hostimmunity. An understanding of gut microbiota-related regulation of immuneresponses has revealed the potential adjuvanticity of particularmicrobiota-derived compounds, driving exploration into their development asvaccine adjuvants. In this review, we discuss how commensal bacteria andcompounds derived from them regulate host immune responses, and we propose thepotential application of these compounds as vaccine adjuvants.

AB  - A case of infant botulism of unknown origin, not involved in honey consumption,occurred in Osaka, Japan in 2020. A Clostridium botulinum type B strain namedOsaka2020 was isolated from a stool sample of the patient. To clarify theepidemiology of the case, we performed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of theisolate and compared it with strains from other sources. WGS analysis revealedthat isolate Osaka2020 was classified into ST133 of a new sequence type, B5subtype, and its toxin gene was encoded in a approximately 274 kb plasmid. Thisplasmid was closely related to the pCLJ plasmid from strain 657Ba in the USA,reported to be conjugatively transferable to other strains. Moreover, isolateOsaka2020 also possesses another smaller plasmid that was common with some typeA(B) infant botulism isolates in Japan. The phylogenetic tree from whole-genomeSNP analysis showed that isolate Osaka2020 was the most closely related to a typeB infant botulism isolate that occurred in Japan 10 years ago. Although noepidemiological connection among the two cases was confirmed, there ispossibility that the cases are attributed to common causes such as someenvironmental substance.

TI  - Tumor suppressor p53 inhibits hepatitis C virus replication by inducingE6AP-mediated proteasomal degradation of the viral core protein.
LID - 10.1002/1873-3468.14461 [doi]
AB  - The tumor suppressor p53 has been implicated in the host defense system againsthepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, although the detailed mechanism remainsunknown. Here, we found that p53 inhibits HCV replication by downregulating HCVCore protein levels in human hepatoma cells. For this effect, p53 potentiated therole of E6-associated protein (E6AP) as an E3 ligase to induce ubiquitination andproteasomal degradation of HCV Core. Specifically, p53 facilitated the binding ofE6AP to HCV Core through direct interactions with the two proteins. In addition, E6AP failed to induce ubiquitination of HCV Core in the absence of p53,suggesting that p53 increases the E3 ligase activity of E6AP in a triple complex consisting of p53, E6AP, and HCV Core.

TI  - Transcription Factors YAP/TAZ and SRF Cooperate To Specify Renal Myofibroblastsin the Developing Mouse Kidney.
LID - ASN.2021121559 [pii]
LID - 10.1681/ASN.2021121559 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The embryonic renal stroma consists of multiple molecularly distinct cell subpopulations, the functional significance of which is largely unknown.Previous work has demonstrated that the transcription factors YAP and TAZ playroles in the development and morphogenesis of the nephrons, collecting ducts, andnephron progenitor cells. METHODS: In embryonic mouse kidneys, we identified asubpopulation of stromal cells with enriched activity in YAP and TAZ. To evaluatethe function of these cell types, we genetically ablated both Yap and Taz fromthe stromal progenitor population and examined how gene activity and development of YAP/TAZ mutant kidneys are affected over a developmental time course. RESULTS:We found that YAP and TAZ are active in a subset of renal interstitium and thatstromal-specific coablation of YAP/TAZ disrupts cortical fibroblast, pericyte,and myofibroblast development, with secondary effects on peritubular capillarydifferentiation. We also demonstrated that the transcription factor SRFcooperates with YAP/TAZ to drive expression of at least a subset of renalmyofibroblast target genes and to specify myofibroblasts, but not corticalfibroblasts or pericytes. CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a critical role for YAP/TAZ in specific embryonic stromal cells and suggest that interaction withcofactors, such as SRF, influence the expression of cell type-specific targetgenes, thus driving stromal heterogeneity. Further, this work reveals functional roles for renal stroma heterogeneity in creating unique microenvironments thatinfluence the differentiation and maintenance of the renal parenchyma.

TI  - Molecular characterisation of Neisseria gonorrhoeae associated with disseminated gonococcal infections in Queensland, Australia: a retrospective surveillancestudy.
PG  - e061040
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2022-061040 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Gonorrhoea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the second mostnotified sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Australia and the case numbersfor this STI have been increasing globally. Progressive gonococcal infection may lead to disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), which causes significantmorbidity among patients. This study aims to examine the genetic diversity of N. gonorrhoeae isolates collected in Queensland from January 2010 to August 2015 andto determine factors associated with DGI in Queensland. DESIGN: Retrospectivesurveillance study for epidemiological purposes. SETTING: All gonorrhoeaeisolates referred by private and public pathology laboratories to the state ofQueensland, Australia Neisseria reference laboratory. METHODS: Between January2010 and August 2015, 3953 N. gonorrhoeae isolates from both metropolitan andregional Queensland infections were typed with NG-MAST (N. gonorrhoeaemultiantigen sequence typing) to assess the genetic diversity between strains.Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to investigate strain-related factorsassociated with DGI. RESULTS: ST6876 was the most common NG-MAST type, detectedin 7.6% of the isolates. DGI was significantly more likely in females <30 years(OR 13.02, p<0.0001) and in older males >30 years (OR 6.04, p<0.0001), with most cases originating from North Queensland (OR 8.5, p<0.0001). Strains harbouringPIA class of porB type were associated with DGI (OR 33.23, p<0.0001). CONCLUSION:Genotyping techniques, such as NG-MAST and WGS, are proving instrumental inproviding an insight into the population structure of N. gonorrhoeae, and geneticmechanisms of pathogenesis, such as for DGI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the durability of response 3 months after the thirdBNT162b2 vaccine in adults aged 60 years and older. DESIGN: Prospective cohortstudy. SETTING: Single tertiary centre. PARTICIPANTS: Healthcare workers/familymembers aged >/=60 years old who received the third BNT162b2 dose. INTERVENTIONS:Blood samples were drawn immediately before (T0), 10-19 days (T1) and 74-103 days(T2) after the third dose. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Anti-spike IgGtitres were determined using a commercial assay and seropositivity was defined as>/=50 arbitrary units (AU)/mL. Neutralising antibody titres were determined atT2. Adverse events, COVID-19 infections and Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) levelswere documented. RESULTS: The analysis included 97 participants (median age, 70years (IQR, 66-74), 58% CFS level 2). IgG titres, which increased significantlyfrom T0 to T1 (median, 440 AU/mL (IQR, 294-923) and median, 25 429 AU/mL (IQR, 14203-36 114), respectively; p<0.001), decreased significantly by T2, but allremained seropositive (median, 8306 AU/mL (IQR, 4595-14 701), p<0.001 vs T1). In a multivariable analysis, only time from the second vaccine was significantlyassociated with lower IgG levels at T2 (p=0.017). At T2, 60 patients wereevaluated for neutralising antibodies; all were seropositive (median, 1294antibody titres; IQR, 848-2072). Neutralising antibody and anti-spike IgG levels were correlated (r=0.6, p<0.001). No major adverse events or COVID-19 infections were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-spike IgG and neutralising antibody levelsremain adequate 3 months after the third BNT162b2 vaccine in healthy adults aged >/=60 years, although the decline in IgG is concerning. A third dose of vaccinein this population should be top priority.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A prophylactic vaccine is needed to control the HCV epidemic, withgenotypes 1-3 causing >80% of worldwide infections. Vaccine development ishampered by HCV heterogeneity, viral escape including protection of conservedneutralising epitopes and suboptimal efficacy of HCV cell culture systems. Wedeveloped cell culture-based inactivated genotype 1-3 HCV vaccine candidates topresent natively folded envelope proteins to elicit neutralising antibodies.DESIGN: High-yield genotype 1a, 2a and 3a HCV were developed by serial passage ofTNcc, J6cc and DBN3acc in Huh7.5 cells and engineering of acquired mutationsdetected by next-generation sequencing. Neutralising epitope exposure wasdetermined in cell-based neutralisation assays using human monoclonal antibodies AR3A and AR4A, and polyclonal antibody C211. BALB/c mice were immunised withprocessed and inactivated genotype 1a, 2a or 3a viruses using AddaVax, ahomologue of the licenced adjuvant MF-59. Purified mouse and patient serum IgGwere assayed for neutralisation capacity; mouse IgG and immune-sera were assayed for E1/E2 binding. RESULTS: Compared with the original viruses, high-yieldviruses had up to ~1000 fold increased infectivity titres (peak titres: 6-7 log10focus-forming units (FFU)/mL) and up to ~2470 fold increased exposure ofconserved neutralising epitopes. Vaccine-induced IgG broadly neutralised genotype1-6 HCV (EC50: 30-193 microg/mL; mean 71 microg/mL), compared favourably with IgGfrom chronically infected patients, and bound genotype 1-3 E1/E2; immune-seraendpoint titres reached up to 32 000. CONCLUSION: High-yield genotype 1-3 HCVcould be developed as basis for inactivated vaccine candidates inducing broadlyneutralising antibodies in mice supporting further preclinical development.

TI  - The quality of veterinary medicines and their implications for One Health.
LID - e008564 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/bmjgh-2022-008564 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Substandard and falsified (SF) veterinary medicines affect animalhealth, agricultural production and food security and will influenceantimicrobial resistance (AMR) in both animals and humans. Yet, our understandingof their extent and impact is poor. We assess the available public domainevidence on the epidemiology of SF veterinary medicines, to better understandtheir prevalence and distribution and their public health impact on animals andhumans. METHODS: Searches were conducted in Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, GlobalHealth, Web of Science, CAB Abstracts, Scopus, Google Scholar, Google andwebsites with interest in veterinary medicines quality up to 28 February 2021.Identified articles in English and French were screened for eligibility. TheMedicine Quality Assessment Reporting Guidelines were used to assess the quality of prevalence surveys. RESULTS: Three hundred and fourteen publications wereincluded with a failure frequency (the percentage of samples that failed at leastone quality test) of 6.5% (2335/35 733). The majority of samples were frompost-marketing surveillance by medicines regulatory authorities of the Republicof Korea and China. A small proportion (3.5%) of samples, all anti-infectives,were from 20 prevalence surveys, with more than half (53.1%, 662/1246) collected in low-income and lower middle-income countries in Africa and Asia. Theprevalence survey sample size ranged from 4 to 310 samples (median (Q1-Q3): 50(27-80)); 55.0% of surveys used convenience outlet sampling methods. In 20prevalence surveys more than half of the samples (52.0%, 648/1246) failed atleast one quality test. The most common defects reported wereout-of-specification active pharmaceutical ingredient(s) (API) content, failureof uniformity of units and disintegration tests. Almost half of samples (49.7%,239/481) that failed API content tests contained at least one of the stated APIs below pharmacopoeial limits. Fifty-two samples (4.2% of all samples) containedone or more incorrect API. One hundred and twenty-three publications describedincidents (recalls/seizures/case reports) of SF veterinary medicines in 29countries. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that SF veterinary products are likely tobe a serious animal and public health problem that has received limitedattention. However, few studies of SF veterinary medicines are available and are geographically restricted. Lower API content and disintegration/dissolution than recommended by pharmacopoeial standards risks treatment failure, animal sufferingand contribute to AMR. Our findings highlight the need of more research, withrobust methodology, to better inform policy and implement measures to assure the quality of veterinary medicines within supply chains. The mechanism and impact ofSF veterinary products on animal and human health, agricultural production, theireconomy and AMR need more transdisciplinary research.

AB  - COVID-19 wastewater-based epidemiology has been performed in catchments ofvarious sizes and sewer types with many short-term studies available andmulti-seasonal studies emerging. The objective of this study was to compareweekly observations of SARS-CoV-2 genes in municipal wastewater across multipleseasons for different systems as a factor of sewer type (combined, separatesanitary) and system size. Sampling occurred following the first wave ofSARS-CoV-2 cases in the study region (June 2020) and continued through the third wave (May 2021), the period during which clinical testing was widely availableand different variants dominated clinical cases. The strongest correlations were observed between wastewater N1 concentrations and the cumulative clinical casesreported in the 2 weeks prior to wastewater sampling, followed by the week prior,new cases, and the week after wastewater sampling. Sewer type and size did notnecessarily explain the strength of the correlations, indicating that othernon-sewer factors may be impacting the observations. In-system sampling resultsfor the largest system sampled are presented for 1 month. Removing wet weatherdays from the data sets improved even the flow-normalized correlations for thesystems, potentially indicating that interpreting results during wet weatherevents may be more complicated than simply accounting for dilution. PRACTITIONER POINTS: SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater correlated best with total clinical casesreported in 2 weeks before wastewater sampling at the utility level. Studyperformed when clinical testing was widespread during the year after the firstCOVID-19 wave in the region. Sewer type and size did not necessarily explaincorrelation strength between clinical cases and wastewater-based epidemiologyresults. Removing wet weather days improved correlations for 3/4 utilitiesstudied, including both separate sanitary and combined sewers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autotrophic carbon fixation is the primary route through whichorganic carbon enters the biosphere, and it is a key step in the biogeochemicalcarbon cycle. The Calvin-Benson-Bassham pathway, which is predominantly found in plants, algae, and some bacteria (mainly cyanobacteria), was previouslyconsidered to be the sole carbon-fixation pathway. However, the discovery of anew carbon-fixation pathway in sulfurous green bacteria almost two decades agoencouraged further research on previously overlooked ancient carbon-fixationpathways in taxonomically and phylogenetically distinct microorganisms. AIM OFREVIEW: In this review, we summarize the six known natural carbon-fixationpathways and outline the newly proposed additions to this list. We also discussthe recent achievements in synthetic carbon fixation and the importance of themetabolism of thermophilic microorganisms in this field. KEY SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS OF REVIEW: Currently, at least six carbon-fixation routes have been confirmed in Bacteria and Archaea. Other possible candidate routes have also been suggested onthe basis of emerging "omics" data analyses, expanding our knowledge andstimulating discussions on the importance of these pathways in the way organisms acquire carbon. Notably, the currently known natural fixation routes cannotbalance the excessive anthropogenic carbon emissions in a highly unbalancedglobal carbon cycle. Therefore, significant efforts have also been made toimprove the existing carbon-fixation pathways and/or design new efficient invitro and in vivo synthetic pathways.

AB  - Infections frequently accompany with non-specific symptoms such as anorexia andhyperthermia. In addition, there may be unpleasant sensations such as visceraldiscomfort during infection. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Gram-negative bacteriacell wall component, is known to induce the unpleasant sensation of conditionedtaste aversion in mammals. However, the relationship between unpleasantsensations and changes in behavior and physiological conditions has not beeninvestigated extensively in birds. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is a compound thatinduces unpleasant sensations, including visceral discomfort, although itseffects on behavior and physiological conditions have also not been investigated extensively in birds. Thus, the present study was aimed to investigate the effectof an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of LiCl on conditioned visual aversion, foodintake, cloacal temperature, voluntary activity, crop-emptying rate, and bloodconstituents in chicks (Gallus gallus). We also examined the effect of IPinjections of LPS and zymosan, a cell wall component of fungus, on conditionedvisual aversion formation. First, IP injection of LiCl was confirmed to induceconditioned visual aversion in chicks. An IP injection of LiCl significantlydecreased food intake, voluntary activity, and crop-emptying rate but did notaffect the temperature. In addition, the injection of LiCl significantlyincreased plasma corticosterone concentration, indicating that LiCl serves as astressor in chicks. Finally, IP injections of LPS and zymosan were found toinduce conditioned visual aversion in chicks. Collectively, these results suggestthat LiCl induces conditioned aversion, anorexia, hypoactivity, and inhibition ofcrop-emptying in chicks. In addition, LPS and zymosan would induce unpleasantsensations in chicks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: and Introduction: SARS-CoV-2 is currently considered as the mostchallenging issue in the field of health and medicine by causing a globalpandemic. Vaccines are counted as a promising candidate to terminate this deadly pandemic. Various structural proteins in SARS-CoV-2 have recently drawn attentionto be utilized as candidate vaccines to stimulate immune responses againstCOVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In current study, the RBD protein was cloned andexpressed in E. coli host. Then, the expressed RBD protein was purified and itscharacterizations were evaluated through various methods. Gold nanoparticles,which were utilized as a carrier for candidate Nano-vaccine, were synthesized viaoxidation-reduction reaction. While Gold NPs-conjugated RBD was injected into thesecond treatment group, in the first candidate vaccine, RBD was injected into thefirst treatment group solely. Complete and Incomplete Freud's Adjuvant were also utilized for both treatment groups to enhance the immune responses against RBDantigen. Immunizations were repeated 2 times in 14-day intervals to boost theimmune system of BALB/c mice. The humoral and cell-mediated immune responses wereexamined through immune and cytokine assays. RESULTS: Our outcomes demonstratethat strong short-term humoral immunity (IgM) was induced in both the first andsecond treatment group, while long-term humoral responses (IgG) were onlyobserved in the second treatment group. While stronger short- and long-termhumoral (IgM and IgG, respectively) were observed in the second treatment group, particular cytokines production (TNF-a and IFN-gamma) as a marker ofcell-mediated responses were significantly higher in the first treatment group.DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study results show the high potentiality of RBDprotein as an appropriate stimulating antigen in vaccine synthesis and testifies RBD-based candidate vaccines to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Our outcomes also recommend that Nano-vaccines can be more suitable candidates when strongerlong-term immune responses matter.

AB  - Bacteria of the cryptic lineage of genus Escherichia, or Escherichia crypticclades (cryptic clades), are phenotypically indistinguishable from Escherichiacoli (E. coli) using standard biochemical tests. Except for clade I (C-I),cryptic clades were hypothetically believed to be environmental but not enteric. If so, they would hinder the interpretation of current E. coli-based waterquality (fecal pollution) monitoring in the United States because environmentalbacteria do not indicate the presence of harmful fecal material. This study wasperformed to develop a rapid method for the detection of cryptic clades and toinvestigate their potential impact on water quality monitoring. By whole-genomecomparison, one gene, named ecc (Escherichiacryptic clades), was identified to beunique to C-II through C-VIII. An end-point polymerase chain reaction (PCR)method, eccPCR, was developed by targeting the ecc. The results of in-silico and wet tests demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity of the eccPCR to detectC-II through C-VIII. Based on the EPA Method 1603, 596 presumptive E. coliisolates were obtained from the fecal samples of 13 different host species and196 isolates from surface water samples taken at four locations in a watershed ofmid-Missouri. As indicated by the eccPCR amplification, the overall prevalence ofC-II through C-VIII in the presumptive E. coli isolates was estimated to be about0.6% in the fecal samples and about 1.6% in the water samples. Therefore, thepotential impact of cryptic clades on water quality monitoring may be limited if EPA Method 1603 is used. Furthermore, clades C-II through C-VIII in stream water samples were found repeatedly only at a single sampling site, but neither at the upstream sites nor five kilometers downstream of the site. The data do notsupport nor reject the environmental hypothesis about cryptic clades. Furtherstudy is needed to determine the implication of the observation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asthma patients often suffer from frequent respiratory viralinfections and reduced virus clearance. Lung resident memory T cells providerapid protection against viral re-infections. OBJECTIVE: As development ofresident memory T cells relies on the lung microenvironment, we investigated the impact of allergen sensitisation on the development of virus-specific lungresident memory T cells and viral clearance. METHODS: Mice were sensitised withhouse dust mite extract followed by priming with X47 and a subsequent secondaryinfluenza infection. Anti-viral memory T cell responses and protection to viralinfection was assessed pre- and post-secondary influenza infection, respectively.Gene set variation analysis was performed on datasets from U-BIOPRED asthmacohort using an IFN-induced epithelial cell signature and a tissue residentmemory T cell signature. RESULTS: Viral loads were higher in lungs of sensitised compared to non-sensitised mice post-secondary infection, indicating reducedvirus clearance. X47 priming induced fewer anti-viral lung resident memory CD8 T cells and resulted in lower pulmonary IFN levels in the lungs of sensitised ascompared to non-sensitised mice. Using data from the U-BIOPRED cohort, we foundthat patients with enrichment of epithelial IFN-induced genes in nasal brushings and bronchial biopsies were also enriched in TRM associated genes, had moreepithelial CD8 T cells and reported significantly fewer exacerbations.CONCLUSION: The allergen sensitised lung microenvironment interferes with theformation of anti-viral resident memory CD8 T cells in lungs and virus clearance.Defective anti-viral memory response might contribute to increased susceptibilityof asthma patients to viral exacerbations.

AB  - Infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria pose a great threat to human health.Non-antibiotic-dependent antibacterial strategies have become the focus ofresearch. Among them, chemical dynamic treatment-based (CDT) therapeutic systems,which catalyze the production of hydroxyl radicals by enzymes, have achievedtremendous success for antibacterial purposes. However, limited kinetics of theFenton reaction, poor permeability, and short half-life of hydroxyl radicalscompromise the antibacterial effects of CDT. In addition, difficulties in theearly diagnosis of infection lead to drug abuse and delayed treatment. Herein, a polydopamine coated ferrous sulfide theranostic platform adsorbing a hypochloriteresponsive probe with photothermal treatment (PTT) enhanced CDT was synthesized. The probe component was used for the early diagnosis of infection. PTT not onlyinactivated bacteria by hyperthermia but also accelerated the Fenton reaction to produce more *OH. In vitro antibacterial experiments demonstrated that themultifunctional theranostic platform has a broad antibacterial spectrum,including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), drug-resistantEscherichia coli (DR E. coli), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). Inaddition, in vivo antibacterial experiments demonstrated that nanoparticles couldeffectively rescue S. aureus-infected full-thickness skin defects with negligiblecytotoxicity. This study proposes an efficient and multifunctional theranosticplatform for bacterial infection, providing an effective synergisticantibacterial strategy for the treatment of antibiotic resistance. STATEMENT OFSIGNIFICANCE: : * An infection responsive theranostic platform (ClO(-)probe@FeS@PDA) is prepared. * CDT is enhanced prominently by PTT at a relativelow temperature. * FeS@PDA exhibits good antibacterial performance against drugresistant bacteria in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Due to the negligible bacterial resistance, chemodynamic therapy (CDT) is apromising treatment for bacterial infection. However, it is severely impeded bythe constant body temperature, shortage of Fe() ions and insufficient H2O2 level in infected tissue. To enhance the therapeutic efficiency of CDT, improvedstrategies are urgently needed to tackle these problems. Herein, we exploited an infection microenvironment-responsive nanotherapeutics for near-infrared(NIR)/dihydroartemisinin (DHA) dual-augmented antibacterial CDT. The convenientencapsulation of DHA-loaded alpha-Fe2O3 nanorods with metal-polyphenol networks(MPN) led to the generation of an antibacterial nanoagent Fe2O3@DHA@MPN (FDM).Afterwards, its photothermal and peroxidase-like activities were intensivelystudied. Furthermore, the bactericidal efficacy of FDM was evaluated through bothin vitro and in vivo antibacterial assays. Firstly, FDM showed both satisfactory photothermal and NIR/DHA dual-augmented peroxidase-like activities. Besides, itexhibited a pH-responsive release behavior of both Fe() ions and DHA. Moreover,it presented tannic acid-mediated bacterial adhesion effect. In vitro experimentsdemonstrated that FDM could achieve a satisfactory efficiency against bothplanktonic bacteria and biofilms. In vivo assays illustrated both theextraordinary synergistic antibacterial effect and efficient anti-inflammatoryability of FDM. The outcomes indicated that the exploited antibacterial agentcould offer new insight on developing intelligent nanotherapeutics for clinicaluse in the future. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: : The antibacterial efficiency ofchemodynamic therapy (CDT) is seriously limited by the constant body temperature,shortage of Fe() ions and insufficient H2O2 level at the mildly acidicinflammatory microenvironment. To address these issues, we have developed apH-responsive nanoagent (Fe2O3@DHA@MPN) for near-infrared(NIR)/dihydroartemisinin (DHA) dual-augmented CDT. Through the NIR-inducedphotothermal effect of exterior Fe()/tannic acid complex, the increased localtemperature led to a photothermal enhanced CDT. Besides, a continuous supply ofFe() ions could be achieved by tannic acid-mediated Fe() reduction. Moreover, DHAwas adopted as a substitute for H2O2 to initiate DHA-mediated CDT. Both in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated its outstanding bactericidal efficiency.Therefore, the developed nanotherapeutics could be a promising candidate forclinical trials.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a widely distributed zoonosis caused by pathogenic strains ofbacteria of the genus Leptospira (Phylum Spirochaetes). Its agents are commonlyclassified based on their antigenic characteristics into serogroups and serovars,which are relevant for epidemiologic studies and vaccine development. Serologicaltests are considered laborious and require a specialized infrastructure. Somemolecular methods have been proposed to accelerate these procedures, but theystill can not replace the immunological tests, thus requiring a furtherunderstanding of the genetic basis underlying the serological classification. In this work, we focused on elucidating the genetic factors determinant for theserogroup Sejroe, which is one of the most prevalent serogroups in livestock. Forthis, we conducted a comparative analysis using >700 leptospiral genomic samples available in the public database. The analysis showed that the genes comprisingthe rfb locus are the main genetic factors associated with the serologicalclassification. Samples from the serogroup Sejroe have an rfb locus with aconserved gene composition that differs from most other serogroups. Hebdomadisand Mini were the only serogroups whose samples have an rfb locus with similargene composition to those from serogroup Sejroe, corroborating with theserological affinity shared by them. Finally, we could determine a small regionin the rfb locus in which each of those three serogroups can be distinguished by its gene composition. This is the first work that uses an extensive repertoire ofgenomic data of leptospiral samples to elucidate the molecular basis of theserological classification and open the road to more reliable strategies based onmolecular methods for serodiagnosis.

AB  - Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays a role as a rheostatic transcriptionfactor in regulating intestinal inflammation, and its disruption or constitutive activation leads to inflammation and injury. However, the molecular mechanisms ofNF-kappaB regulation remain largely unknown. In this study, theNF-kappaB-regulated host defenses against pathogen infections and facilitation ofIL17 expression during stimulation with different bacteria were investigated.Intestinal inflammation was induced by dextran sulfate sodium, and NF-kappaBactivity was inhibited in an intestinal injury model. Mannose receptor C type,ABF1/2, serpin B13, lysozyme, and beta-arrestin were significantly controlled by NF-kappaB in the inflamed intestinal tissue. High levels of NF-kappaB activation resulted in less pervasive intestinal damage and the maintenance of intestinalbarrier integrity. Intestinal injury robustly increased the expression of IL17.NF-kappaB activation was enhanced by IL17 deficiency in the intestinal injurymodel. IL17 inhibition aggravated intestinal inflammation, leading to loss ofepithelial architecture and the infiltration of inflammatory cells. These datasuggest that NF-kappaB and IL17 play key mediator roles in the maintenance of gutepithelial integrity and immune homeostasis.

AB  - Municipal solid waste (MSW) leachate treatment through the anaerobic ammoniumoxidation (anammox) process has received increasing attention due to less oxygen consumption, carbon source demand, and sludge production. The recent advances in anammox-mediated MSW leachate treatment are systematically reviewed. During MSWleachate treatment, the anammox technology could be flexibly combined withpartial nitrification, partial denitrification, fermentation, and methaneoxidation. Additionally, this review comprehensively discussed the specificeffects on anammox bacteria (AnAOB) of key stressors in MSW leachate such asdissolved organic matters, salinity, and antibiotics, and introduced thecorresponding pretreatment methods. The key control strategies focusing onachieving effective AnAOB retention, amelioration of microenvironments, andstable nitrite source were summarized. Moreover, the potential for nitrous oxide emission mitigation in anammox-based MSW leachate treatment systems wasevaluated. Finally, this review highlighted the full-scale applications ofanammox-mediated MSW leachate treatment and proposed the prospects as well asresearch gaps in this field.

AB  - The presence of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) when treating low-strengthammonia wastewater was a challenge in the application of the PN/A process. Thepartial nitrification/ANAMMOX/partial nitrification/ANAMMOX (PN/A/PN/A) processbased on multiple oxidations of ammonia was proposed to solve this problem. Theinfluence of independent variables such as nitrite concentration was analyzedbased on the response surface method (RSM). The model showed that nitriteconcentration has an adverse impact on ammonia removal efficiency and nitriteaccumulation rate. The model provided optimal parameters for the PN/A/PN/Aprocess: the dissolved oxygen concentration was 0.60 mg/L, and the cycle durationwas 90 min. Advanced nitrogen removal was achieved by maintaining the nitriteconcentration below 10.0 mg/L. The nitrogen removal efficiency was 81.44 +/-4.15%, and the nitrogen removal rate was 0.18 +/- 0.02 kg N/(m(3)d). Potentialfunctions of microorganisms were analyzed by functional annotation of prokaryotictaxa (FAPROTAX) and the correlation network analysis was performed.

AB  - Herein we report the ternary hybrid nanocomposite of iron oxide @ molybdenumcarbide micro flowers decorated graphitic-carbon nitride (Fe3O4@MoC MFs/g-CN), asa catalyst for the detection of organophosphorus pesticide, parathion (PAT), for the first time. The growth of hierarchical nanostructure from the core level willfacilitate easy diffusion of analyte and interact more effectively with thereactive catalytic sites. Thus, Fe3O4 NFs architecture was hydrothermally grownover MoC flakes from the core level, which further hybridized with g-CN to ensureelectrical conductivity and mechanical stability. Experimental resultsdemonstrate that Fe3O4@MoC MFs/g-CN/GCE has superior catalytic efficacy for PATreduction. At optimum conditions, the proposed sensor exhibits a low detectionlimit (7.8 nM), high sensitivity, and wide linear range (0.5-600 microM) towardPAT detection. The satisfactory test results of the food samples indicate thatthe Fe3O4@MoC MFs/g-CN/GCE sensor can be used as an excellent candidate forreal-time PAT detection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conceived with an aim to correlate mast cell expression and angiogenesis in oral lichen planus (OLP) and inflamed oral mucosa. DESIGN: Anobservational study was performed on fifty tissue blocks of OLP and inflamed oralmucosa which were stained immunohistochemically using mast cell tryptase, CD34and CD105. The data was analysed using Mann Whitney U-test and Spearman's rankcorrelation coefficient test (p < 0.05). RESULTS: OLP showed significantly highermast cell density for total and degranulated mast cells and higher microvesseldensity (CD105) compared to inflamed oral mucosa (p = 0.006, 0.000). Microvessel density, total and mean vascular area (CD34) were higher in inflamed oral mucosa with a non significant difference (p = 0.985, 0.977, 0.720). Mild negativeassociation was observed between mast cells and angiogenesis in OLP (p = 0.879). A significant positive correlation was seen between degranulated mast cells andmicrovessel density (CD34) in inflamed oral mucosa (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Mast cells execute different roles in OLP depending upon stage of the disease. Wefound that although degranulation of mast cells is not the predominant pathwayfor angiogenesis in OLP, yet is one of the important precursor phenomena ininflamed tissues.

AB  - This study is aimed to select optimum keratin degradation ability from Bacillusstrains for feather meal-soybean meal fermentation, and favorably water contentfor the strain during fermentation of feather meal-soybean meal, and finallyinvestigate the effects of the fermented feather meal-soybean meal product(FFSMP) on growth performance, carcass trait, clinical blood biochemistry, andintestinal morphology of broilers. Thirty-six bacteria strains from soil, sewage pool, and feather waste were screened and selected Bacillus subtilis var. nattoN21 (N21), B. subtilis CU14 (CU14), and B. amyloliquefaciens CU33 (CU33) withbetter keratinase activity and feather-degrading rate. The result of trial 1showed that the FFSMP produced by CU33 had the optimum physiochemicalcharacterizations, amino acid composition and feeding performance for broilers.Hence the effects of water content (45, 50, 55, and 60%) on FFMSP fermentation ofCU33 were investigated in trial 2. Result showed that pH value, counts ofBacillus-like bacteria, gamma-PGA, viscosity, surfactin yield and odor allsignificantly increased according to the water content (P < 0.05). The proteaseactivity reached significantly highest in the 55% and 60% water content groups (P< 0.01). The broilers performance of 55% and 60% water content group weresignificantly higher than control group (P < 0.05) in weight gain (WG), feedintake (b) at 0 to 21-d-old and the WG, feed conversion ratio (FCR), andproduction efficiency factor at 0 to 35-d-old, and could reach the similar growthperformance as fish meal group (P > 0.05). The fermentation groups significantly decreased urea nitrogen (P < 0.05) and increased creatinine (P < 0.05) in theblood. The fermentation groups also significantly decreased the crypt depth inthe duodenum (P < 0.05) and increased villus height to crypt depth ratio of theduodenum (P < 0.05). In conclusion, CU33 shows the best degradation rate forfeather and keratinase activity, and the FFSMP with a water content of 50% to 60%during fermentation is suggested. Diets supplemented with 5% FFSMP can promotethe growth of broilers by improving the morphology of the duodenum and achievethe feeding effect of high-quality fish meal.

AB  - Microbial denitrification is a crucial biological process for the treatment ofnitrogen-polluted water. Traditional denitrification process consumes externalorganic carbon leading to an increase in treatment costs. We developed a novelsulfide-driven denitrification methane oxidation (SDMO) system that integratesautotrophic denitrification (AD) and denitrification anaerobic methane oxidation (DAMO) for cost-effective denitrification and biogas utilization in situ. TwoSDMO systems were operated for 735 days, with nitrate and nitrite serving aselectron acceptors, to explore the performance of sewage denitrification andcharacterize metabolic mechanisms. Results showed SDMO system could reach as highas 100% efficiency of nitrogen removal and biogas desulfurization without anexternal carbon source when HRT was 10 days and inflow nitrogen concentrationswere 50-100 mgN.L(-1). Besides, nitrate was a preferable electron acceptor forSDMO system. Biogas not only enhanced nitrogen removal but also intensified theDAMO, nitrogen removed through DAMO contribution doubled as original period from 2.9 mgN.(L.d)(-1) to 6.2 mgN.(L.d)(-1), and the ratio of nitrate removal through AD to DAMO was 1.2:1 with nitrate as electron acceptor. While nitrogen removedalmost all through AD contribution and DAMO was weaken as before, the ratio ofnitrate removal through AD to DAMO was 21.2:1 with nitrite as electron acceptor. Biogas introduced into SDMO system with nitrate inspired the growth of DAMObacteria Candidatus Methylomirabilis from 0.3% to 19.6% and motivated itspotentiality to remove nitrate without ANME archaea participation accompanyingwith gene mfnE upregulating approximately 100 times. According to thereconstructed genome from binning analysis, the dramatically upregulated genemfnE was derived from Candidatus Methylomirabilis, which may represent a novelmetabolism pathway for DAMO bacteria to replace the role of archaea for nitratereduction.

AB  - We explored the self-reported antibiotic stewardship (AS), and infectionprevention and control (IPC) activities in intensive care units (ICUs) ofdifferent income settings. A cross-sectional study was conducted using an online questionnaire to collect data about IPC and AS measures in participating ICUs.The study participants were Infectious Diseases-International Research Initiative(IDI-IR) members, committed as per their institutional agreement form. Weanalyzed responses from 57 ICUs in 24 countries (Lower-middle income (LMI), n =13; Upper-middle income (UMI), n = 33; High-income (HI), n = 11). Thisrepresented (~5%) of centers represented in the ID-IRI. Surveillance programswere implemented in (76.9%-90.9%) of ICUs with fewer contact precaution measures in LMI ones (p = 0.02); (LMI:69.2%, UMI:97%, HI:100%). Participation in regional antimicrobial resistance programs was more significantly applied in HI (p = 0.02)(LMI:38.4%,UMI:81.8%,HI:72.2%). AS programs are implemented in 77.2% ofinstitutions with AS champions in 66.7%. Infectious diseases physicians andmicrobiologists are members of many AS teams (59%&50%) respectively. Unqualified healthcare professionals(42.1%), and deficient incentives(28.1%) are the mainbarriers to implementing AS. We underscore the existing differences in IPC and ASprograms' implementation, team composition, and faced barriers. Continuouscollaboration and sharing best practices on APM is needed. The role of regionaland international organizations should be encouraged. Global support for capacitybuilding of healthcare practitioners is warranted.

AB  - Lignocellulosic materials (LMs) are abundant feedstocks with excellent potential for biofuels and biocommodities production. In particular, nut and coffee wastes are rich in biomolecules, e.g. sugars and polyphenols, the valorisation of which still has to be fully disclosed. This study investigated the effectiveness ofultrasounds coupled with hydrothermal (i.e. ambient temperature vs 80 degrees C) and methanol (MeOH)-based pretreatments for polyphenols and sugar solubilisation from hazelnut skin (HS), almond shell (AS), and spent coffee grounds (SCG). Theliquid fraction obtained from the pretreated HS was the most promising in termsof biomolecules solubilisation. The highest polyphenols, i.e. 123.9 (+/-2.3) mg/gTS, and sugar, i.e. 146.0 (+/-3.4) mg/g TS, solubilisation was obtained using theMeOH-based medium. However, the MeOH-based media were not suitable for directanaerobic digestion (AD) due to the MeOH inhibition during AD. The water-basedliquors obtained from pretreated AS and SCG exhibited a higher methane potential,i.e. 434.2 (+/-25.1) and 685.5 (+/-39.5) mL CH4/g glucosein, respectively, thanthe HS liquors despite having a lower sugar concentration. The solid residuesrecovered after ultrasounds pretreatment were used as substrates for AD as well. Regardless the pretreatment condition, the methane potential of the ultrasoundspretreated HS, AS, and SCG was not improved, achieving maximally 255.4 (+/-7.4), 42.8 (+/-3.3), and 366.2 (+/-4.2) mL CH4/g VS, respectively. Hence, the solid andliquid fractions obtained from HS, AS, and SCG showed great potential either assubstrates for AD or, in perspective, for biomolecules recovery in a biorefinery context.

AB  - A point-of-care (POC) device is reported for highly sensitive and selectivedetection of Plasmodium falciparum lactate dehydrogenase (Pf-LDH), a biomarker ofmalaria infection, based on a single-step magneto-immunoassay, a single-usemicrofluidic paper device and a customized hand-held fluorescence reader. Thesingle-step magneto-immunoassay consists in a single 5-min incubation ofimmuno-modified magnetic particles (c-MAb-MPs), biotinylated detection antibody(bd-MAb), and an enzymatic signal amplifier (Poly-HRP). After on-chip MPconcentration and washing, signal generation is achieved by adding a fluorescent enzymatic substrate (QuantaRed). Fluorescence signal is measured using a low-costcustomized, portable, and sensible fluorescent detector. The POC affordsquantitative Pf-LDH detection in <20 min, with a detection limit of 0.92 ngmL(-1) (equivalent to 4.6 parasites muL(-1)). Furthermore, Pf-LDH quantitation inclinical samples correlates with that provided by the reference ELISA, is moresensitive than a commercial rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and entails little userintervention. These results show that fluorescent paper-based microfluidicdevices can be exploited to simplify magneto-immunoassay handling, taking thistype of test closer to the requirements of POC testing.

AB  - Various non-nucleic acid targets (ions, small molecules, polysaccharides,peptides/proteins/enzymes, cells, transcription factors) are importantbiomarkers. They play important roles in environmental protection, food safetyand medical diagnosis. Therefore, it is necessary to detect non-nucleic acidtargets from various samples before the situation deteriorates. Derived fromprokaryotic immune systems, CRISPR/Cas tools have exhibited great promise in the field of biosensing, in addition to the well-known gene-editing function.However, most reported CRISPR/Cas-based biosensors are for nucleic acid detectionand the application of non-nucleic acid targets is still in its infancy. To fullyexplore the potential of CRISPR/Cas-based biosensing systems, it is of greatsignificance to summarize the strategies and prospects of CRISPR/Cas toolboxes innon-nucleic acid targets recognition. In this review, we introduced CRISPR/Cassystems and their characteristics in the field of detection. The progress ofdetecting six non-nucleic acid targets was outlined and reviewed based onCRISPR/Cas systems coupled with biotransduction elements, including aptamers,DNAzymes, riboswitches, enzymatic reactions, transcription factors,antigen-antibody interactions, allosteric probes, in vitro transcriptionprocesses, steric hindrance effectors, etc. The development challenges andprospects in this field were also put forward. As such, this comprehensive reviewwould provide valuable information for the expansion of the powerful CRISPR/Castoolboxes into multiple detection fields.

TI  - Antibacterial Theranostic Agents with Negligible Living Cell Invasiveness:AIE-Active Cationic Amphiphiles Regulated by Alkyl Chain Engineering.
LID - 10.1021/acsnano.2c01721 [doi]
AB  - To address the threat of bacterial infection in the following post-antibioticera, developing effective antibacterial approaches is of utmost urgency.Theranostic medicine integrating diagnosis and therapy is a promising protocol tofight against pathogenic bacteria. But numerous reported antibacterialtheranostic materials are disclosed to be trapped in the excessive invasivenessto living mammal cells, leading to false positives and possible biosafety risks. Herein, a series of cationic pyridinium-substituted phosphindole oxidederivatives featuring aggregation-induced emission are designed, and alkyl chain engineering is conducted to finely tune their hydrophobicity and investigatetheir bioaffinity preference for living mammal cells and pathogenic bacteria.Most importantly, an efficient theranostic agent (PyBu-PIO) is acquired that isfree from living cell invasiveness with negligible cytotoxicity and yet holds agood affinity for Gram-positive bacteria, including drug-resistant strains, with a superior inactivating effect. Externally applying PyBu-PIO onto Gram-positivebacteria-infected skin wounds can achieve creditable imaging effects andsuccessfully accelerate the healing processes with reliable biosafety. This work proposes living cell invasiveness as a criterion for antibacterial theranosticmaterials and provides important enlightenment for the design of antibacterialtheranostic materials.

AB  - Plant assisted bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil isconsidered an effective green technology whereby accelerated degradation occursdue to converged effect of microorganisms and plants. However, survival andgrowth of microbes and plants under stress conditions is challenging task forsuccess of the technology. In this study, plant growth promoting bacteriacontaining 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)-deaminase activity andtolerance to petroleum hydrocarbon contamination were used in association withalfalfa for bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soil. Eightpre-isolated bacterial isolates from soil having previous history of petroleumcontamination were used in convergence with alfalfa on sand soil which wasartificially contaminated (10 g crude oil per kg(-1) of coarse textured soil).Combined effect of bacteria and plants on the degradation of petroleumhydrocarbons under controlled conditions of light and temperature was observedfor a period of 60 days. The results of the study revealed that four bacterialisolates Bacillus subtilis strain PM32Y, Bacillus cereus strain WZ3S1, Bacillussp. strain SM73 and Bacillus sp. strain WZ3S3 in association with alfalfasignificantly degraded petroleum hydrocarbons. The most significantbiodegradation (47%) of petroleum hydrocarbons was recorded in the experimentalunit receiving PM32Y inoculation in association with alfalfa. Biodegradation ofpetroleum hydrocarbons was 33% with alone inoculation (without alfalfa) of PM32Y.The study revealed that combined use of bacteria and alfalfa plant is moreefficient than alone application of either bacteria or plants for degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons.

TI  - Nutritional, Microbiological, and Toxicological Quality Assessment of Foods Sold in Urban and Suburban Markets in Burkina Faso.
LID - 10.1089/hs.2022.0023 [doi]
AB  - Food safety risks are becoming a public health problem with importantsocioeconomic consequences for human wellbeing, especially for pregnant women andinfants. In this article, we describe findings from microbiological,toxicological, and nutritional quality assessments of foods from 5 localities in Burkina Faso, with the aim to provide baseline data on the quality of food andthe risks to mothers and children. Samples for assessment included food sold inmarkets, stores, and restaurants (eg, cereals, oilseeds, vegetables, edible oils,powdered milk, dried fish, packaged water, ready-to-eat meals). The research teamselected the samples using the random route method and analyzed them at theNational Public Health Laboratory in Ouagadougou between January and December2020. A total of 443 food samples were collected, of which 101 were analyzed for microbial contamination, 360 were analyzed for the presence of toxins, and 59were analyzed for their nutritional value. The microbiological quality of 11.88% of the food samples was unsatisfactory, and 41.50% were contaminated withaflatoxins. At least 1 pesticide residue and cyfluthrin were detected in 58.10%of samples. The most detected contaminant (cyfluthrin) was found in 79.10% of theanalyzed samples. A peroxide index higher than the normal value (10 mEq/kg) wasfound in 3.38% of the oil samples and 76.27% of the oil samples had a vitamin Acontent lower than the recommended limit of 11 mg/kg. This study is the first in Burkina Faso that provides baseline data on the quality of food and potentialhealth risks to mothers and children in Burkina Faso. Considering the level ofcontaminants reported in this article, it is imperative to enhance routinemonitoring of foods in the country.

TI  - Evaluation of the Antimicrobial Effect of Photodynamic Therapy and Er:YAG LaserIrradiation on Root Canals Infected with Enterococcus faecalis.
LID - 10.1089/photob.2021.0027 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To carry out a histological and morphometric analysis of theantimicrobial effect of Er:YAG laser irradiation combined with photodynamictherapy (PDT) on root canals infected with Enterococcus faecalis. Background: PDTand Er:YAG laser irradiation may be alternatives for effective endodonticdisinfection but there are no data on the combination of these therapies.Materials and methods: Forty single-rooted bovine teeth had their rootscontaminated with E. faecalis for 72 h. The teeth were randomly divided into fourgroups (n = 10): group 1, irrigation with 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl); group2, Er:YAG laser (lambda2940 nm, 15 Hz, 100 mJ); group 3, PDT with 0.07% methyleneblue as photosensitizer and laser irradiation (lambda660 nm, power 40 mW, 5 min);and group 4, Er:YAG laser + PDT. After treatment, the teeth were examined byconfocal laser scanning microscopy to verify bacterial viability, andmorphometric analysis of the images was performed. Results: The PDT and Er:YAG + PDT treatments promoted the greatest reduction in bacteria among the proposedtherapies, whereas 2.5% NaOCl was the least effective in bacterial elimination. Astatistically significant difference (p < 0.05) was observed among the groupsstudied, except between the group combining Er:YAG and PDT and the group treated with PDT alone. Conclusions: PDT combined or not with Er:YAG laser was found tobe more effective in root canal disinfection when compared with the other groups.

TI  - Anaerobic Degradation of Alkanes by Marine Archaea.
LID - 10.1146/annurev-micro-111021-045911 [doi]
AB  - Alkanes are saturated apolar hydrocarbons that range from its simplest form,methane, to high-molecular-weight compounds. Although alkanes were onceconsidered biologically recalcitrant under anaerobic conditions, microbiological investigations have now identified several microbial taxa that can anaerobically degrade alkanes. Here we review recent discoveries in the anaerobic oxidation of alkanes with a specific focus on archaea that use specific methyl coenzyme Mreductases to activate their substrates. Our understanding of the diversity ofuncultured alkane-oxidizing archaea has expanded through the use of environmentalmetagenomics and enrichment cultures of syntrophic methane-, ethane-, propane-,and butane-oxidizing marine archaea with sulfate-reducing bacteria. A recentlycultured group of archaea directly couples long-chain alkane degradation withmethane formation, expanding the range of substrates used for methanogenesis.This article summarizes the rapidly growing knowledge of the diversity,physiology, and habitat distribution of alkane-degrading archaea. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Microbiology, Volume 76 isSeptember 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates forrevised estimates.

TI  - Mussel-Inspired Clickable Antibacterial Peptide Coating on Ureteral Stents forEncrustation Prevention.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c09448 [doi]
AB  - Long-term indwelling catheters or stents often cause complications likeinfection, encrustation, hematuria, pain, and so on. The source of these problemsis bacteria, which can form biofilms on the stents to reduce antibioticsensitivity and produce urease to form encrustation by increasing the urine pH.Urinary tract infection (UTI) can aggravate the body damage and even seriouslyendanger lives, and the encrustation will block the stents, which can causehydronephrosis and renal function damage. Therefore, the prevention of UTI andencrustation represents a great challenge in clinical ureteral stent uses. Inthis work, a clickable mussel-inspired peptide and antimicrobial peptide (AMP)were used to functionalize the commercial stents' surfaces to inhibit long-terminfection and encrustation caused by bacteria. Copper (Cu) ions were used tocoordinate the mussel-inspired peptide to improve the stability. The AMP with an azido group was clicked to the mussel-inspired Cu-coordinated peptide coatingthrough click chemistry. The bio-inspired antibacterial coating was constructedwith excellent stability, bactericidal properties, and improved biologicalcompatibility. In in vitro and in vivo experiments, it was further found that thecoating showed bactericidal and encrustation reduction abilities. This study thusdeveloped an effective, safe, and stable AMP coating on urinary stents/catheters capable of long-term antibacterial and encrustation inhibition.

TI  - Omicron-associated changes in SARS-CoV-2 symptoms in the United Kingdom.
LID - ciac613 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac613 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant has been replaced by the highlytransmissible Omicron BA.1 variant, and subsequently by Omicron BA.2. It isimportant to understand how these changes in dominant variants affect reportedsymptoms, while also accounting for symptoms arising from other co-circulatingrespiratory viruses. METHODS: In a nationally representative UK community study, the COVID-19 Infection Survey, we investigated symptoms in PCR-positive infectionepisodes vs. PCR-negative study visits over calendar time, by age and vaccinationstatus, comparing periods when the Delta, Omicron BA.1 and BA.2 variants weredominant. RESULTS: Between October-2020 and April-2022, 120,995 SARS-CoV-2PCR-positive episodes occurred in 115,886 participants, with 70,683 (58%)reporting symptoms. The comparator comprised 4,766,366 PCR-negative study visits (483,894 participants); 203,422 (4%) reporting symptoms. Symptom reporting inPCR-positives varied over time, with a marked reduction in loss of taste/smell asOmicron BA.1 dominated, maintained with BA.2 (44%/45% 17 October 2021, 16%/13% 2 January 2022, 15%/12% 27 March 2022). Cough, fever, shortness of breath, myalgia,fatigue/weakness and headache also decreased after Omicron BA.1 dominated, butsore throat increased, the latter to a greater degree than concurrent increasesin PCR-negatives. Fatigue/weakness increased again after BA.2 dominated, althoughto a similar degree to concurrent increases in PCR-negatives. Symptoms wereconsistently more common in adults aged 18-65 years than in children or olderadults. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in sore throat (also common in the generalcommunity), and a marked reduction in loss of taste/smell, make Omicron harder todetect with symptom-based testing algorithms, with implications for institutionaland national testing policies.

TI  - MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OF HAWAIIAN GEESE (BRANTA SANDVICENSIS) AND LAYSANALBATROSS (PHOEBASTRIA IMMUTABILIS) ASSOCIATED WITH RETICULOENDOTHELIOSIS VIRUS.
LID - 10.7589/JWD-D-21-00164 [doi]
AB  - Only one virus, Avipox, has been documented previously in wild birds in Hawaii.Using immunohistochemistry and PCR, we found that two native threatened Hawaiian Geese (Branta sandvicensis), one with multicentric histiocytoma and the otherwith toxoplasmosis, and one Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) with avianpox were infected with reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV). The virus was isolated from one of the geese by cell culture. Surveys of other Hawaiian geese withvarious pathologies, avian pox cases, and pox viral isolates using PCR failed to reveal REV, suggesting that the virus is uncommon, at least in samples examined. The full genome of the Gag, Pol, and Env genes were sequenced for all threeinfected birds and revealed geographic divergence of the Pol gene, suggesting it to be under strong selective pressure. Our finding of REV in Hawaii makes thisonly the second virus documented in native Hawaiian birds associated withpathology. Moreover, the presence of REV in a pelagic seabird is unusual. Future surveys should seek the reservoir of the virus in efforts to trace its origins.

TI  - Safety of De-Escalating Empiric Antimicrobial Agents in Trauma Patients withIndigenous Oral Flora Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia.
PG  - 597-603
LID - 10.1089/sur.2022.126 [doi]
AB  - Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a frequently occurringnosocomial infection in critically ill trauma patients. When bronchoalveolarlavage (BAL) returns with indigenous oral flora (IOF), de-escalatingantimicrobial therapy is challenging. Patients and Methods: This is aretrospective review of trauma patients who received broad-spectrum empiricantimicrobial therapy for clinical VAP, and whose BAL culture resulted with>100,000 CFU/mL of IOF from September 1, 2017 to September 1, 2020. Patients wereidentified using the trauma database and microbiology reports of BALs with IOF.This review evaluated the effect of antibiotic de-escalation on recurrent orpersistent pneumonia. Results: Of 51 trauma patients with clinical VAP and IOF,18 patients (35.3%) had antimicrobial agents de-escalated. De-escalation wasdriven primarily by the discontinuation of vancomycin, with the continuation of abeta-lactam antibiotic as monotherapy for the remainder of the treatment course(n = 15; 86.7%). The overall rate of either persistent or recurrent VAP in thecohort was 10%, and this did not differ statistically between those who received de-escalation therapy after isolation of IOF and those who did not (16.7% vs.6.1%; p = 0.224), however, the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) was higher in the non-de-escalation group (39.4% vs. 11.1%; p = 0.034). There was nostatistical difference in ventilator days, intensive care unit (ICU) length ofstay, or hospital length of stay between treatment groups. Conclusions: Traumapatients who develop VAP with isolated BAL cultures of IOF or mixed flora cansafely have anti-methicilllin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)antimicrobial agents discontinued, and this may result in decreased rates of AKI.

TI  - Pathogens and Shift of Resistance in Early Infections after Operative FractureFixation.
PG  - 583-589
LID - 10.1089/sur.2022.033 [doi]
AB  - Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) remain a challenge for the healthcaresystem. During the last 30 years, the literature has shown an increase ofgram-negative bacterial strains in multiple infectious sites and thatcephalosporins have replaced penicillin as the gold standard in peri-operativeantibiotic prophylaxis. This study aims to examine the recent bacterial spectrum in orthopedic early SSIs and to compare it with a historical cohort. Patients andMethods: Patients in a level 1 trauma center with an SSI within six weeks afteropen fixation of a fracture were analyzed in two adjacent periods from 2007 to2012 (data pool 1; DP1) and 2013 to 2017 (data pool 2; DP2), retrospectively. Thedetected microbiologic pathogens and the associated resistograms from both timeperiods were compared. Results: Six hundred eighty-one smear tests and respectivepathogens from the wounds of 463 patients (mean age, 62.6 +/- 20 years) with SSIswere analyzed. The following pathogens were found most frequent: Staphylococcusepidermidis (DP1, 20.6%; DP2, 26.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (DP1, 27.1%; DP2,16.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (DP1, 13.7%; DP2, 11.1%), Bacillus sp. (DP1, 3.0%; DP2, 5.3%), Escherichia coli (DP1, 5.1%; DP2, 4.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (DP1,3.7%; DP2, 2.5%). In DP2, there were lower primary early infection rates withStaphylococcus aureus than in DP1 (p = 0.002). In DP2, Staphylococcus epidermidisshowed an oxacillin resistance in 90.6% and an increased resistance (79.8%; p =0.069) to several classes of antibiotic agents compared to DP1. Conclusions: Nobacterial shift toward gram-negative species was observed in this investigation. However, Staphylococcus epidermidis showed an increased antibiotic resistance in the more recent patient cohort. The incidence of SSIs with Staphylococcus aureus decreased substantially.

TI  - Acid-Directed Electrostatic Self-Assembly Generates Charge-Reversible Bacteriafor Enhanced Tumor Targeting and Low Tissue Trapping.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.2c08684 [doi]
AB  - Despite recent preclinical progress with oncolytic bacteria in cancer therapy,dose-limiting toxicity has been a long-standing challenge for clinicalapplication. Genetic and chemical modifications for enhancing the bacterialtumor-targeting ability have been unable to establish a balance betweenincreasing its specificity and effectiveness while decreasing side effects.Herein, we report a simple, highly efficient method for rapidly self-assembling aclinically used lipid on bacterium and for reducing its minimum effective doseand toxicity to normal organs. The resultant bacteria present the ability toreverse-charge between neutral and acidic solutions, thus enabling weakinteractions with the negatively charged normal cells, hence increasing theirbiocompatibility with blood cells and with the immune system. Additionally, thelipid-coated bacteria exhibit a longer blood circulation lifetime and low tissue trapping compared with the wild-type strains. Thereby, the engineered bacteriashow enhanced tumor specificity and effectiveness even at low doses. Multiplevisualization techniques are used for vividly demonstrating the time course ofbacterial circulation in the blood and normal organs after intravenousadministration. We believe that these methods for biointerfacial lipidself-assembly and evaluation of bacterial systemic circulation possess vastpotential in exquisitely fabricating engineered bacteria for cancer therapy inthe future.

AB  - Anthropogenic organophosphorus compounds (AOPCs), such as phosphotriesters, areused extensively as plasticizers, flame retardants, nerve agents, and pesticides.To date, only a handful of soil bacteria bearing a phosphotriesterase (PTE), the key enzyme in the AOPC degradation pathway, have been identified. Therefore, the extent to which bacteria are capable of utilizing AOPCs as a phosphorus source,and how widespread this adaptation may be, remains unclear. Marine environmentswith phosphorus limitation and increasing levels of pollution by AOPCs may drive the emergence of PTE activity. Here, we report the utilization of diverse AOPCsby four model marine bacteria and 17 bacterial isolates from the MediterraneanSea and the Red Sea. To unravel the details of AOPC utilization, two PTEs frommarine bacteria were isolated and characterized, with one of the enzymesbelonging to a protein family that, to our knowledge, has never before beenassociated with PTE activity. When expressed in Escherichia coli with aphosphodiesterase, a PTE isolated from a marine bacterium enabled growth on apesticide analog as the sole phosphorus source. Utilization of AOPCs may provide bacteria a source of phosphorus in depleted environments and offers a prospectfor the bioremediation of a pervasive class of anthropogenic pollutants.

TI  - Deciphering the Inhibition of Ethane on Anaerobic Ammonium Oxidation.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c01527 [doi]
AB  - Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) and nitrification, two common biologicalammonium oxidation pathways, are critical for the microbial nitrogen cycle. Shortchain alkanes (C2-C8) have been well-known as inhibitors for nitrificationthrough interaction with the ammonia monooxygenase, while whether these alkanesaffect anammox is an open question. Here, this work demonstrated significantinhibition of ethane on anammox and revealed the inhibitory mechanism. The acute inhibition of ethane on anammox was concentration-dependent and reversible; 0.86 mM dissolved ethane caused 50% inhibition (IC50), and 1.72 mM ethane almostcompletely inhibited anammox. After long-term exposure to 0.09 mM ethane for 30days, the ammonium (nitrite) removal rate dropped from 202 (267) mg N L(-1) d(-1)to 1 (1) mg N L(-1) d(-1), and the abundance of anammox bacteria decreased from61.9% to 9.5%. The intercellular ammonium concentration of anammox bacteriadecreased after ethane exposure, while metatranscriptome analysis showedsignificant upregulation of genes for ammonium transport of anammox bacteria.Thus, ethane could suppress ammonium uptake resulting in the inhibition ofanammox activities. As ethane is the second most prevalent alkane after methanein various anoxic environments, ethane may have an important effect on thenitrogen cycle driven by anammox that should be investigated in future research.

TI  - Atypical integrative element with strand-biased circularization activity assists interspecies antimicrobial resistance gene transfer from Vibrio alfacsensis.
PG  - e0271627
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0271627 [doi]
AB  - The exchange of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes between aquaculture andterrestrial microbial populations has emerged as a serious public health concern.However, the nature of the mobile genetic elements in marine bacteria is poorlydocumented. To gain insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying AMR genetransfer from marine bacteria, we mated a multidrug-resistant Vibrio alfacsensis strain with an Escherichia coli strain, and then determined the complete genomesequences of the donor and the transconjugant strains. Sequence analysis revealeda conjugative multidrug resistance plasmid in the donor strain, which wasintegrated into the chromosome of the recipient. The plasmid backbone in thetransconjugant chromosome was flanked by two copies of a 7.1 kb unclassifiableintegrative element harboring a beta-lactamase gene. The 7.1 kb element and thepreviously reported element Tn6283 share four coding sequences, two of whichencode the catalytic R-H-R-Y motif of tyrosine recombinases. Polymerase chainreaction and sequencing experiments revealed that these elements generate acircular copy of one specific strand without leaving an empty site on the donormolecule, in contrast to the movement of integron gene cassettes or ICE/IMEsdiscovered to date. These elements are termed SEs (strand-biased circularizingintegrative elements): SE-6945 (the 7.1 kb element) and SE-6283 (Tn6283). Thecopy number and location of SE-6945 in the chromosome affected the antibioticresistance levels of the transconjugants. SEs were identified in the genomes ofother Vibrio species. Overall, these results suggest that SEs are involved in thespread of AMR genes among marine bacteria.

AB  - Fungal infection causes deterioration, discoloration, and loss of nutritionalvalues of food products. The use of lactic acid bacteria has diverse applicationsin agriculture to combat pathogens and to improve the nutritional values ofcereal grains. The current research evaluated the potential of Loigolactobacilluscoryniformis BCH-4 against aflatoxins producing toxigenic Aspergillus flavusstrain. The cell free supernatant (CFS) of Loig. coryniformis was used for theprotection of Zea mays L. treated with A. flavus. No fungal growth was observedeven after seven days. The FT-IR spectrum of untreated (T1: without anytreatment) and treated maize grains (T2: MRS broth + A. flavus; T3: CFS + A.flavus) showed variations in peak intensities of functional group regions oflipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. Total phenolics, flavonoid contents, andantioxidant activity of T3 were significantly improved in comparison with T1 and T2. Aflatoxins were not found in T3 while observed in T2 (AFB1 and AFB2 = 487 and16 ng/g each). HPLC analysis of CFS showed the presence of chlorogenic acid,p-coumaric acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, caffeic acid, sinapic acid, salicylicacid, and benzoic acid. The presence of these acids in the CFS of Loig.coryniformis cumulatively increased the antioxidant contents and activity of T3treated maize grains. Besides, CFS of Loig. coryniformis was passed throughvarious treatments (heat, neutral pH, proteolytic enzymes and catalase), toobserve its stability. It suggested that the inhibitory potential of CFS against A. flavus was due to the presence of organic acids, proteinaceous compounds andhydrogen peroxide. Conclusively, Loig. coryniformis BCH-4 could be used as a goodbioprotecting agent for Zea mays L. by improving its nutritional and antioxidant contents.

AB  - The current Covid-19 pandemic has a profound impact on all aspects of our lives. Aside from contagion by aerosols, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 is ubiquitous onsurfaces that millions of people handle daily. Therefore, controlling thispandemic involves the reduction of potential infections via contaminatedsurfaces. We developed antiviral surfaces by preparing suspensions of copper and cupric oxide nanoparticles in two different polymer matrices, poly(methylmethacrylate) and polyepoxide. For total copper contents as low as 5%, thecomposite material showed remarkable antiviral properties against the HCoV-OC43human coronavirus and against a model lentivirus and proved well-resistant toaccelerated aging conditions. Importantly, we showed that the Cu/CuO mixtureshowed optimal performances. This product can be implemented to produce a simple and inexpensive coating with long-term antiviral properties and will open the wayto developing surface coatings against a broad spectrum of pathogens includingSARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Does Plant Identity Affect the Dispersal of Resistomes Above and Below Ground?
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.1c08733 [doi]
AB  - Resistomes are ubiquitous in natural environments. Previous studies have shownthat both the plant phyllosphere and soil-borne nematodes were reservoirs ofabove- and below-ground resistomes, respectively. However, the influence of plantidentity on soil, nematode, and phyllosphere resistomes remains unclear. Here, a microcosm experiment was used to explore the characteristics of bacterialcommunities and resistomes in soil, nematode, and phyllosphere associated withsix different plant identities (Lactuca sativa, Cichorium endivia, Alliumfistulosum, Coriandrum sativum, Raphanus sativus, and Mesembryanthemumcrystallinum). A total of 222 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and 7 mobilegenetic elements (MGEs) were detected by high-throughput quantitative PCR fromall samples. Plant identity not only significantly affected the diversity ofresistomes in soil, nematode, and phyllosphere but also influenced the abundance of resistomes in nematodes. Shared bacteria and resistomes indicated a possiblepathway of resistomes transfer through the soil-nematode-phyllosphere system.Structural equation models revealed that plant identity had no direct effect onphyllosphere ARGs, but altered indirectly through complex above- and below-groundinteractions (soil-plant-nematode trophic transfer). Results also showed thatbacteria and MGEs were key factors driving the above- and below-ground flow ofresistomes. The study extends our knowledge about the top-down and bottom-updispersal patterns of resistomes.

AB  - Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) infection is commonlyreported in countries of Northeast Asia including China, Japan and South Korea.The majority of the SFTS patients are elderly and the average fatality rate ismore than 10%. A rapid and sensitive diagnostic method to monitor and preventSFTSV transmission remains an urgent clinical challenge. In this study, wedeveloped a molecular diagnostic technique for detection of SFTSV using theCRISPR-Cas12a system combined with reverse transcription recombinase polymeraseamplification (RT-RPA). Using this method, we successfully diagnosed SFTSVinfections with the reaction time of 50 min from blood plasma withoutcross-reactivity to other viruses, supporting its application for rapid andsensitive diagnosis of SFTS.

TI  - Parecoxib expresses anti-metastasis effect through inhibition ofepithelial-mesenchymal transition and the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway inhuman colon cancer DLD-1 cell line.
LID - 10.1002/tox.23631 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in Taiwan. Currenttreatments involve combination of surgical resection, radiation, andchemotherapy. These treatments have demonstrated to increased five-year survival of a patient with colorectal cancer. However, metastasis is a major capability ofcancer cells that causes poor prognosis, recurrence, and even death.Epidemiological and clinical studies have suggested the use of non-steroidalanti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as an effective class of compounds to preventcolon cancer. Parecoxib is an NSAID and the only parenterally administeredselective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor. In this study, we evaluated whetherparecoxib inhibits the metastasis of DLD-1 human colon cancer cells, a COX-2 nullcell line, and the underlying mechanism. Cell migration of the DLD-1 cells wassignificantly inhibited by parecoxib treatment as shown by the Transwellmigration assay. This enhanced anti-migration effect was correlated with theattenuated phosphorylation of Akt, expression of vimentin (a mesenchymal marker),and beta-catenin, and corresponded with the upregulated GSK3beta and E-cadherin(an epithelial marker). These findings suggested that parecoxib could inhibit theepithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis in human colon cancercells by downregulating beta-catenin. Thus, parecoxib could provide a novelprospective strategy for a combination treatment with chemotherapeutic drugsagainst metastasis of human colon cancer.

LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001221 [doi]
AB  - Pectobacterium atrosepticum is part of a larger family of soft rot bacteria(Pectobacteriaceae) that cause disease on a wide range of crops worldwide. Theyare closely related to members of the Enterobacteriaceae and, as the plantpathogens and plant associated members of the group, form part of a continuumtowards opportunistic and more devastating animal and human pathogens. Many ofthe horizontally acquired islands present in the genome of P. atrosepticum aredirectly responsible for life on plants. These include genes for a plethora ofplant cell wall degrading enzymes, plant toxins, siderophores etc., which areexported by multiple secretion systems under a highly coordinated regulationsystem.

TI  - Exploring the Functions of Efficient Canonical Denitrifying Bacteria as N2OSinks: Implications from (15)N Tracer and Transcriptome Analyses.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c02119 [doi]
AB  - In denitrifying reactors, canonical complete denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate(NO3(-)) to nitrogen via N2O. However, they can also produce N2O under certainconditions. We used a (15)N tracer method, in which (15)N-labeled NO3(-)/nitrite (NO2(-)) and nonlabeled N2O were simultaneously supplied with organic electrondonors to five canonical complete denitrifying bacteria affiliated with eitherClade I or Clade II nosZ. We calculated their NO3(-), NO2(-), and N2O consumptionrates. The Clade II nosZ bacterium Azospira sp. strain I13 had the highest N2Oconsumption rate (3.47 +/- 0.07 fmol/cell/h) and the second lowest NO3(-)consumption rate (0.20 +/- 0.03 fmol/cell/h); hence, it is a N2O sink. A changefrom peptone- to acetate/citrate-based organic electron donors increased theNO3(-) consumption rate by 4.8 fold but barely affected the N2O consumption rate.Electron flow was directed to N2O rather than NO3(-) in Azospira sp. strain I13and Az. oryzae strain PS only exerting a N2O sink but to NO3(-) in the Clade InosZ N2O-reducing bacteria Pseudomonas stutzeri strain JCM 5965 andAlicycliphilus denitrificans strain I51. Transcriptome analyses revealed that thegenotype could not fully describe the phenotype. The results show that N2Oproduction and consumption differ among canonical denitrifying bacteria and will be useful for developing N2O mitigation strategies.

TI  - Namco: a microbiome explorer.
LID - 10.1099/mgen.0.000852 [doi]
AB  - 16S rRNA gene profiling is currently the most widely used technique in microbiomeresearch and allows the study of microbial diversity, taxonomic profiling,phylogenetics, functional and network analysis. While a plethora of tools havebeen developed for the analysis of 16S rRNA gene data, only a few platforms offera user-friendly interface and none comprehensively covers the whole analysispipeline from raw data processing down to complex analysis. We introduce Namco,an R shiny application that offers a streamlined interface and serves as aone-stop solution for microbiome analysis. We demonstrate Namco's capabilities bystudying the association between a rich fibre diet and the gut microbiotacomposition. Namco helped to prove the hypothesis that butyrate-producingbacteria are prompted by fibre-enriched intervention. Namco provides a broadrange of features from raw data processing and basic statistics down to machinelearning and network analysis, thus covering complex data analysis tasks that arenot comprehensively covered elsewhere. Namco is freely available athttps://exbio.wzw.tum.de/namco/.

Herein, we show that Era ortholog in the attenuated Mtb H37Ra strain, MRA_2388 (annotated as Era(MT)) is a cellenvelope localized protein harbouring critical GTP-binding domains, whichinteracts with several envelope proteins of Mtb. The purified Era from M.smegmatis (annotated as Era(MS)) exhibiting ~90 % sequence similarity withEra(MT), exists in monomeric conformation. While it is co-purified with RNA upon overexpression in E. coli, the presence of RNA does not modulate the GTPaseactivity of the Era(MS) as against its counterpart from other organisms. CRISPRi silencing of eraMT does not show any substantial effect on the in vitro growth ofMtb H37Ra, which suggests a redundant function of Era in mycobacteria. Notably,no effect on ribosome assembly, protein synthesis or bacterial susceptibility to protein synthesis inhibitors was observed upon depletion of Era(MT) in Mtb H37Ra,further indicating a divergent role of Era GTPase in mycobacteria.

TI  - Spermidine promotes lysozyme tolerance and acid stress resistance inStreptococcus pyogenes M3.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001228 [doi]
AB  - Streptococcus pyogenes are Gram-positive opportunistic pathogens residing in the human nasopharynx and skin. Changes in environmental conditions, such as pH,temperature and availability of essential ions, can stimulate the expression ofS. pyogenes virulence factors. One such factor could be the availability of anextracellular pool of polyamines. Polyamines are synthesized from amino acids,and are universally present in the environment. Polyamines have been implicatedin the ecology of pathogenesis by modulating quorum sensing, host adaptation and virulence. Polyamines mediate pathogenesis and help the pathogen resistenvironmental stress. In this study, we investigated the ability of thepolyamine, spermidine, to promote acid stress survival of S. pyogenes. S.pyogenes does not synthesize spermidine, but the extracellular pool of spermidineconstituted by the host and microbiome could be utilized as a signallingmolecule. We report that spermidine promotes acid stress resistance in S.pyogenes. Moreover, spermidine affects the morphology of S. pyogenes bydecreasing the cell size and increasing the dltA gene expression. Along withdltA, spermidine upregulated the gene expression of cell wall-modifying genessuch as mur, pgdA, pepO and srtA, which might help the bacteria to resist acidic stress.

TI  - Association of Receiving a Fourth Dose of the BNT162b Vaccine With SARS-CoV-2Infection Among Health Care Workers in Israel.
PG  - e2224657
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.24657 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Despite the high 3-dose vaccination rate among health care workers(HCWs) in Israel, a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in this groupwas observed during the Omicron wave. As a result, the Israeli Ministry of Healthdecided to recommend a fourth vaccine dose to medical staff. Objective: Toevaluate the benefit of a fourth BNT162b2 vaccine dose on the breakthroughinfection rate among HCWs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicentercohort study was performed in January 2022, the first month of the 4-dosevaccination campaign, during a surge of the Omicron variant wave. All health careworkers at 11 general hospitals in Israel who had been vaccinated with 3 doses upto September 30, 2021, and had not contracted COVID-19 before the vaccinationcampaign were included. Exposures: Vaccination with a fourth dose of the BNT162b2vaccine during January 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Breakthrough COVID-19infections in 4-dose recipients vs 3-dose recipients measured by a polymerasechain reaction test result positive for SARS-CoV-2. Health care workers weretested based on symptoms or exposure. Results: A total of 29611 Israeli HCWs(19381 [65%] female; mean [SD] age, 44 [12] years) had received 3 vaccine dosesbetween August and September 2021; of these, 5331 (18%) received the fourth dose in January 2022 and were not infected by the first week after vaccination.Overall breakthrough infection rates were 368 of 5331 (7%) in the 4-dose groupand 4802 of 24280 (20%) in the 3-dose group (relative risk, 0.35; 95% CI,0.32-0.39). Similar reductions were found in a matched analysis by the exact day of receiving the third vaccine (relative risk, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.54-0.71) and in a time-dependent Cox proportional hazards regression model (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.50-0.63). In both groups, no severe disease or death occurred.Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, the fourth BNT162b2 vaccine doseresulted in a reduced breakthrough infection rate among hospital staff. Thisreduction was lower than that observed after the third dose; nevertheless,considering the high infectivity of the Omicron variant, which led to criticalmedical staff shortages, a fourth vaccine dose should be considered to mitigatethe infection rate among HCWs.

AB  - Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria are a type of beneficial bacteria whichinhabit in the rhizosphere and possess the abilities to promote plant growth.Pseudomonas putida LWPZF is a plant growth-promoting bacterium isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Cercidiphyllum japonicum. Inoculation treatment with LWPZFcould significantly promote the growth of C. japonicum seedlings. P. putida LWPZFhas a variety of plant growth-promoting properties, including the ability tosolubilize phosphate, synthesize ACC deaminase and IAA. The P. putida LWPZFgenome contained a circular chromosome (6,259,530 bp) and a circular plasmid(160,969 bp) with G+C contents of 61.75% and 58.25%, respectively. There were5632 and 169 predicted protein-coding sequences (CDSs) on the chromosome and the plasmid respectively. Genome sequence analysis revealed lots of genes associated with biosynthesis of IAA, pyoverdine, ACC deaminase, trehalose, volatiles acetoinand 2,3-butanediol, 4-hydroxybenzoate, as well as gluconic acid contributingphosphate solubilization. Additionally, we identified many heavy metal resistancegenes, including arsenate, copper, chromate, cobalt-zinc-cadmium, and mercury.These results suggest that P. putida LWPZF shows strong potential in the fieldsof biofertilizer, biocontrol and heavy metal contamination soil remediation. The data presented in this study will allow us to better understand the mechanisms ofplant growth promotion, biocontrol, and anti-heavy metal of P. putida LWPZF.

TI  - Cardiac Assessment in Children with MIS-C: Late Magnetic Resonance ImagingFeatures.
LID - 10.1007/s00246-022-02977-y [doi]
AB  - Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) is a new entity that emerges 2-4 weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. MIS-C can affect all systems, themost severe of which is cardiac involvement. The duration of the cardiac symptomsis still uncertain and may be persistent or prolonged. The American College ofRheumatology Clinical Guidelines recommends cardiac magnetic resonance imaging(MRI) 2-6 months after the diagnosis of MIS-C in patients presenting withsignificant transient left ventricular (LV) dysfunction in the acute phase ofillness (LV ejection fraction 50%) or persistent LV dysfunction. There are a few studies investigating cardiac MRI findings in MIS-C patients. In this study, weaimed to evaluate cardiac MRI findings, at the earliest 3 months after diagnosis,and compare these findings with the echocardiograms in children with MIS-C. Aretrospective study including 34 MIS-C patients was conducted at a tertiary-levelUniversity Hospital between June 2020 and July 2021. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria were used in the diagnosis of MIS-C. Cardiac MRI wasperformed at least 3 months after MIS-C diagnosis. The study included 17 (50%)boys and 17 (50%) girls with a mean age of 9.31 +/- 4.72 years. Initialechocardiographic evaluation revealed cardiac abnormality in 13 (38.2) patients; 4 (11.8%) pericardial effusion, 4 (11.8%) left ventricular ejection fraction(LVEF) < 55%, and 5 (14.7%) coronary artery dilatation. Echocardiography showednormal LV systolic function in all patients during follow-up; coronary dilatationpersisted in 2 of 5 (40%) patients at the 6th-month visit. Cardiac MRI wasperformed in 31 (91.2%) patients, and myocardial hyperemia was not detected inany patients (T1 relaxation time was < 1044 ms in all children). However, 9 (29%)patients' MRI showed isolated elevated T2 levels, and 19 (61.3%) revealed atleast one of the following findings: pericardial effusion, right ventriculardysfunction, or LVEF abnormality. In patients with MIS-C, a high rate of cardiac involvement, particularly pericardial effusion was determined by cardiac MRIperformed at the earliest 2-6 months after diagnosis. Even if echocardiographydoes not reveal any abnormality in the initial phase, cardiac MRI should besuggested in MIS-C patients in the late period. This is the first study reportingcardiac MRI findings in the late period of MIS-C patients.

TI  - Host-Endosymbiont Relationship Impacts the Retention of Bacteria-ContainingAmoeba Spores in Porous Media.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c02899 [doi]
AB  - Amoebae are protists that are commonly found in water, soil, and other habitatsaround the world and have complex interactions with other microorganisms. In thiswork, we investigated how host-endosymbiont interactions between amoebae andbacteria impacted the retention behavior of amoeba spores in porous media. Amodel amoeba species, Dictyostelium discoideum, and a representative bacterium,Burkholderia agricolaris B1qs70, were used to prepare amoeba spores that carried bacteria. After interacting with B. agricolaris, the retention of D. discoideumspores was enhanced compared to noninfected spores. Diverse proteins, especially proteins contributing to the looser exosporium structure and cell adhesionfunctionality, are secreted in higher quantities on the exosporium surface ofinfected spores compared to that of noninfected ones. Comprehensive examinations using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D), a parallel platechamber, and a single-cell force microscope present coherent evidence thatchanges in the exosporium of D. discoideum spores due to infection by B.agricolaris enhance the connections between spores in the suspension and thespores that were previously deposited on the collector surface, thus resulting inmore retention compared to the uninfected ones in porous media. This workprovides novel insight into the retention of amoeba spores after bacterialinfection in porous media and suggests that the host-endosymbiont relationshipregulates the fate of biocolloids in drinking water systems, groundwater, andother porous environments.

TI  - Course Prerequisites: Here, There, and Everywhere. Time to Standardize?
LID - 10.1097/JPA.0000000000000436 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study's aim was to examine prerequisite course requirementsand compare them to previous studies with a secondary aim to examine potentialdifferences relative to program characteristics. METHODS: Data were extractedfrom the websites of 265 entry-level physician assistant (PA) programs fromOctober 2020 until December 2020. Course prerequisites as well as number ofcourses and semester hours required were described and examined according toprogram location, phase, Carnegie Classification, association with a medicalschool, and the public/private status of the sponsoring institution. RESULTS: Of 264 PA programs, more than 50% of programs required 6 common prerequisites:anatomy, physiology, microbiology, statistics, general chemistry, and psychology.The total number of unique prerequisite courses was 28 for all programs with areduction in humanities and social sciences semester hours compared to previousstudies and a slight increase in credit hours required for the common 6 courses. Total prerequisite hours and courses required were higher for master's programs; private, not-for-profit programs; newly established programs; and those notassociated with a medical school. Newer programs are generally located inprivate, not-for-profit educational institutions that are not associated with amedical school. Programs in the Mountain Division required a lower number ofprerequisites, and the South Region required the greatest number of prerequisite courses and semester hours. DISCUSSION: The present study demonstrates adifference in prerequisite requirements across the country. This could translate to increased cost and a potential barrier to those considering a career as a PA.

TI  - Shape-Encoded Functional Hydrogel Pellets for Multiplexed Detection of PathogenicBacteria Using a Gas Pressure Sensor.
LID - 10.1021/acssensors.2c01186 [doi]
AB  - Gas pressure is a promising signal readout mode in point-of-care testing for its merits such as rapidity, simplicity, affordability, and no need for sophisticatedinstrumentation. Herein, a gas pressure sensor for multiplexed detection ofpathogenic bacteria was developed on a hydrogel platform. Spherical and squarehydrogel pellets prepared by cross-linking of sodium alginate were functionalizedwith nisin and ConA for the capture of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coliO157:H7, respectively. By using the shape-encoded functional hydrogel pellets andaptamer-modified platinum-coated gold nanoparticles (Au@PtNPs), a dual-moleculerecognition mode was established for rapid and specific detection of the twopathogenic bacteria. Au@PtNPs were applied as signal probes to efficientlycatalyze the decomposition of H2O2 for generating abundant O2, which wasconverted into an amplified gas pressure signal. In two closed containers, thesignificant gas pressure signals were monitored with a portable pressure meter toquantitate the two pathogenic bacteria. The sensor was successfully applied todetect the pathogenic bacteria in various environmental, biological, and foodsamples. Thus, the proof-of-principle work paves a new avenue for multiplexeddetection of pathogenic bacteria with shape-encoded hydrogel pellets combinedwith gas pressure signal readout.

TI  - Epigallocatechin gallate as a nutraceutical to potentially target the metabolicsyndrome: novel insights into therapeutic effects beyond its antioxidant andanti-inflammatory properties.
PG  - 1-23
LID - 10.1080/10408398.2022.2104805 [doi]
AB  - Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is one of the most abundant and powerfulflavonoids contained in green tea. Because of the global increase in green teaconsumption, there has been a general interest in understanding its healthbenefits, including its bioactive compounds like EGCG. Indeed, preclinicalevidence already indicates that EGCG demonstrated a strong antioxidant andanti-inflammatory properties that could be essential in protecting againstmetabolic syndrome. The current review explores clinical evidence reporting onthe beneficial effects of EGCG supplementation in obese subjects or patients withdiverse metabolic complications that include type 2 diabetes and cardiovasculardisease. The discussion incorporates the impact of different formulations ofEGCG, as well as the effective doses and treatment duration. Importantly, besideshighlighting the potential use of EGCG as a nutraceutical, the current reviewalso discusses crucial evidence related to its pharmaceutical development as anagent to hinder metabolic diseases, including its bioavailability and metabolism profile, as well as its well-known biological properties.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of the mtrCDE efflux pump operon: importance forNeisseria gonorrhoeae antimicrobial resistance.
LID - 10.1099/mic.0.001231 [doi]
AB  - This review focuses on the mechanisms of transcriptional control of an important multidrug efflux pump system (MtrCDE) possessed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, theaetiological agent of the sexually transmitted infection termed gonorrhoea. ThemtrCDE operon that encodes this tripartite protein efflux pump is subject to bothcis- and trans-acting transcriptional factors that negatively or positivelyinfluence expression. Critically, levels of MtrCDE can influence levels ofgonococcal susceptibility to classical antibiotics, host-derived antimicrobialsand various biocides. The regulatory systems that control mtrCDE can haveprofound influences on the capacity of gonococci to resist current and pastantibiotic therapy regimens as well as virulence. The emergence, mechanisms ofaction and clinical significance of the transcriptional regulatory systems thatimpact mtrCDE expression in gonococci are reviewed here with the aim of linkingbacterial antimicrobial resistance with multidrug efflux capability.

PG  - 5278-5284
LID - 29319 [pii]
LID - 10.26355/eurrev_202207_29319 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In 2019, the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic broke out,caused by the coronavirus called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Reinfections can be observed with various respiratory viruses,including human coronaviruses. Moreover, they may result from weak or waninginitial immune response, reinfection with another genotype/subtype, or the rapid antigenic changes in the virus. The aim of this study was to investigate thelikelihood of reinfection in COVID-19 patients that had a positive qPCR testresult at least 60 days after a negative test result in patients that wereconfirmed with COVID-19 on qPCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The quantitativepolymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results of a total of 105,000 samples that hadbeen obtained between April 1, 2020, and February 1, 2021, in two separateauthorized laboratories were retrospectively analyzed. 22 samples from 11patients included in the study, qPCR tests were repeated for each sample usingthe Rotorgene Q PCR system with Diagnovital SARS-CoV-2 (RTA Labs, Turkey)Real-Time PCR kits. Positive samples were screened for B.1.1.7 and E484Kmutations using the qPCR method on the Rotorgene Q PCR system with Bio-SpeedySARS-CoV-2 Variant Plus kits (Bioeksen Technology, Turkey). RESULTS: The 105,000 individuals comprised 55,614 men and 49,386 women. In the qPCR test, 14,511(13.82%) individuals were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 11(0.076%) patients were included in the study based on the inclusion criteria.Accordingly, the risk of reinfection was calculated as 0.076% (95% confidenceinterval [CI]: 0.056%-0.096%) and the incidence was 1.04 per 10,000 population(95% CI: 0.62-1.38 per 10,000). No patient was admitted to the intensive careunit or died during both episodes. Moreover, no B.1.1.7 or E484K mutation wasdetected in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of COVID-19 infectionposes serious risks for the development of new variants and the currently usedvaccines are likely to lose their efficacy against new variants. To reduce these risks and to be successful in the fight against the pandemic, we suggestcompliance with personal protective measures as well as rapid and widespreadapplication of vaccination not only in developed countries but also in the whole world and the modification of currently used vaccines in such a way to fightagainst newly emerged variants.

TI  - Starved of ACTION: A Critical Look at the Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plansof African Countries.
LID - 10.1021/acsinfecdis.2c00303 [doi]
AB  - The urgent need for Africa, as a continent, to start galvanizing resources andstrengthening its capacity to win the fight against the looming threat ofantimicrobial resistance (AMR) was once again brought to the limelight by therecent study on the "Global Burden of Bacterial Antimicrobial Resistance" (TheLancet 2022, 399, 629). According to the study, western sub-Saharan Africa is asuper-region for AMR, with overall mortality rates due to and associated with AMRstanding at 27.3 and 114.8 per 100000 people, respectively. Putting this inperspective, if the leaders of this region do not take effective action, Africawill indeed be one of the two worst-affected regions, along with Asia, with thepossibility of over 4.1 million people dying annually from AMR by 2050. Thedevelopment of a National Action Plan, as directed by the World HealthOrganization, provides an important framework for addressing the complex andmulti-faceted nature of the rise and spread of drug-resistant bacteria. Thispaper reviews the AMR National Action Plans of African countries and calls on theleaders of this region to move from paper to action and to look beyond just thereduction of antibiotic consumption and, as a more comprehensive response to the threat of AMR, focus also on expanding access to safe drinking water, betteringsanitary conditions, maintaining effective leadership at all levels ofgovernance, increasing government spending on healthcare services, andstrengthening regulatory oversight.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It is unclear whether polyomavirus BK (BKPyV) miRNA measurement hasadditional diagnostic and predictive value in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) as compared to current methods of monitoring BKPyV DNA loads. PATIENTS ANDMETHODS: A retrospective, longitudinal study was performed in 30 KTR with BKPyVviruria (n = 10), BKPyV viremia (n = 10) or BKPyVAN (n = 10). Bkv-miR-B1-3p, 5pand BKPyV DNA-load were measured in urine and plasma and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. RESULTS: Levels of Bkv-miR-B1-3p and 5pand BKPyV DNA correlated strongly. Overall, mostly analogue courses of urinaryand plasma miRNA and DNA loads were observed. Areas under the ROC curves were notsignificantly different between miRNAs and DNA. Only, in contrast to BKPyV DNAload, BKPyV miRNA levels increased from 6 to 12 months in the viremia group,while in the BKPyVAN group a decline was seen in both DNA and miRNA. CONCLUSIONS:In this study we could not demonstrate an additional value of BKPyV miRNAdetection compared to BKPyV DNA monitoring in the early phase after kidneytransplantation. We did observe significant differences between the viremia andthe BKPyVAN groups during follow up. This study was performed with a small numberof patients and therefore results should be verified in a larger patient cohort. Furthermore, future studies with larger patient groups are necessary to elucidatefinal clinical value of these data. This article is protected by copyright. Allrights reserved.

AB  - Probiotics have been used for decades to alleviate the negative side-effects oforal antibiotics, but our mechanistic understanding on how they work is so farincomplete. Here, we performed a metagenomic analysis of the fecal microbiota in participants who underwent a 14-d Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy with orwithout consumption of a multi-strain probiotic intervention (L. paracasei CNCMI-1518, L. paracasei CNCM I-3689, L. rhamnosus CNCM I-3690, and four yogurtstrains) in a randomized, double-blinded, controlled clinical trial. Using astrain-level analysis for detection and metagenomic determination of replication rate, ingested strains were detected and replicated transiently in fecal samples and in the gut during and following antibiotic administration. Consumption of thefermented milk product led to a significant, although modest, improvement in the recovery of microbiota composition. Stratification of participants into twogroups based on the degree to which their microbiome recovered showed i) a higherfecal abundance of the probiotic L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus strains and ii) anelevated replication rate of one strain (L. paracasei CNCMI-1518) in the recoverygroup. Collectively, our findings show a small but measurable benefit of afermented milk product on microbiome recovery after antibiotics, which was linkedto the detection and replication of specific probiotic strains. Such functionalinsight can form the basis for the development of probiotic-based interventionaimed to protect gut microbiome from drug treatments.

TI  - The inactivation efficacy of plasma-activated acetic acid against SalmonellaTyphimurium cells and biofilm.
LID - 10.1111/jam.15757 [doi]
AB  - AIM: This study aimed to examine the inactivation efficacy of plasma-activatedacetic acid (PAAA) against Salmonella Typhimurium cells and biofilm and elucidatethe underlying the chemical inactivation pathway. METHODS AND RESULTS: PAAA wasprepared by discharging plasma to 20 ml of 0.2% (v/v) acetic acid (AA) for 20 min(2.2 kHz and 8.4 kVpp). The count of cells and biofilms decreased by 5.71 log CFUml(-1) and 4 log CFU/cm(2) after 10 min of treatment with 0.2% PAAA and 0.4% PAAAcompared with control group (without any treatment), respectively. In 0.2% PAAA, the concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) and nitrate anions were directlyproportional to the plasma discharge time, while nitrite anions (NO2 (-) ) wasnot detected. However, the pH values of both 0.2% PAAA and plasma-activated waterwere inversely proportional to the plasma discharge time. Treatment withcatalase, L-histidine, D-mannitol, and sodium azide inhibited the antibacterialactivity of PAAA. CONCLUSION: H2 O2 , Singlet oxygen, Hydroxyl radical, and NO2(-) are involved in the generation and decomposition of peroxynitrous acidgenerated from PAAA functioned as intermediate agent, which could diffuse throughcell membranes of bacteria and induce cell injury. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OFSTUDY: This study provides the understanding of efficacy and selectivity of PAAA which could be a novel decontamination agent.

TI  - The effects of grape seed proanthocyanidins in cafeteria diet-induced obeseFischer 344 rats are influenced by faecal microbiota in a photoperiod dependentmanner.
LID - 10.1039/d2fo01206e [doi]
AB  - Polyphenols are of high interest due to their beneficial health effects,including anti-obesity properties. The gut microbiota may play an important role in polyphenol-mediated effects as these bacteria are significantly involved inthe metabolism of polyphenols. Moreover, seasonal rhythms have been demonstrated to influence both the gut microbiota composition and polyphenol bioavailability. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of photoperiods andmicrobiota on polyphenol functionality in an obesogenic context. Towards thisaim, cafeteria diet-fed Fischer 344 rats were housed under three differentphotoperiod conditions (L6: 6 h of light, L12: 12 h of light and L18: 18 h oflight) for 9 weeks. During the last 4 weeks of the experiment, rats were dailyadministered with an oral dose of a grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE)(25 mg per kg body weight). Additionally, rats treated with GSPE and anantibiotic cocktail (ABX) in their drinking water were included for a betterunderstanding of the gut microbiota role in GSPE functionality. Vehicle andnon-ABX treated rats were included as controls. GSPE decreased body weight gainand fat depots only under L18 conditions. Interestingly, the gut microbiotacomposition was strongly altered in this photoperiod. GSPE + ABX-treated ratsgained significantly less body weight compared to the rats of the rest of thetreatments under L18 conditions. These results suggest that GSPE functionality ismodulated by the gut microbiota in a photoperiod dependent manner. These novelfindings corroborate seasonal rhythms as key factors that must be taken intoaccount when investigating the effects of polyphenols in the treatment orprevention of chronic diseases.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Factor XII (FXII), the precursor of the protease FXIIa,contributes to pathologic processes including angioedema and thrombosis. Here, wereview recent work on structure-function relationships for FXII based on studies using recombinant FXII variants. RECENT FINDINGS: FXII is a homolog ofpro-hepatocyte growth factor activator (Pro-HGFA). We prepared FXII in whichdomains are replaced by corresponding parts of Pro-HGA, and tested them in FXIIactivation and activity assays. In solution, FXII and prekallikrein undergoreciprocal activation to FXIIa and kallikrein. The rate of this process isrestricted by the FXII fibronectin type-2 and kringle domains. Pro-HGAreplacements for these domains accelerate FXII and prekallikrein activation. WhenFXII and prekallikrein bind to negatively charged surfaces, reciprocal activationis enhanced. The FXII EGF1 domain is required for surface binding. SUMMARY: Wepropose a model in which FXII is normally maintained in a closed conformationresistant to activation by intramolecular interactions involving the fibronectin type-2 and kringle domains. These interactions are disrupted when FXII binds to asurface through EGF1, enhancing FXII activation and prekallikrein activation byFXIIa. These observations have important implications for understanding thecontributions of FXII to disease, and for developing therapies to treatthrombo-inflammatory disorders.

TI  - Porcine Deltacoronavirus Infection Cleaves HDAC2 to Attenuate Its AntiviralActivity.
PG  - e0102722
LID - 10.1128/jvi.01027-22 [doi]
AB  - Protein acetylation plays an important role during virus infection. Thus, it isnot surprising that viruses always evolve elaborate mechanisms to regulate thefunctions of histone deacetylases (HDACs), the essential transcriptional andepigenetic regulators for deacetylation. Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), anemerging enteropathogenic coronavirus, causes severe diarrhea in suckling pigletsand has the potential to infect humans. In this study, we found that PDCoVinfection inhibited cellular HDAC activity. By screening the expressions ofdifferent HDAC subfamilies after PDCoV infection, we unexpectedly found thatHDAC2 was cleaved. Ectopic expression of HDAC2 significantly inhibited PDCoVreplication, while the reverse effects could be observed after treatment with an HDAC2 inhibitor (CAY10683) or the knockdown of HDAC2 expression by specificsiRNA. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PDCoV-encoded nonstructural protein 5(nsp5), a 3C-like protease, was responsible for HDAC2 cleavage through itsprotease activity. Detailed analyses showed that PDCoV nsp5 cleaved HDAC2 atglutamine 261 (Q261), and the cleaved fragments (amino acids 1 to 261 and 262 to 488) lost the ability to inhibit PDCoV replication. Interestingly, the Q261cleavage site is highly conserved in HDAC2 homologs from other mammalian species,and the nsp5s encoded by seven tested mammalian coronaviruses also cleaved HDAC2,suggesting that cleaving HDAC2 may be a common strategy used by differentmammalian coronaviruses to antagonize the antiviral role of HDAC2. IMPORTANCE As an emerging porcine enteropathogenic coronavirus that possesses the potential to infect humans, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is receiving increasingattention. In this work, we found that PDCoV infection downregulated cellularhistone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. Of particular interest, the viral 3C-likeprotease, encoded by the PDCoV nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5), cleaved HDAC2, andthis cleavage could be observed in the context of PDCoV infection. Furthermore,the cleavage of HDAC2 appears to be a common strategy among mammaliancoronaviruses, including the emerging severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), to antagonize the antiviral role of HDAC2. To ourknowledge, PDCoV nsp5 is the first identified viral protein that can cleavecellular HDAC2. Results from our study provide new targets to develop drugscombating coronavirus infection.

TI  - New Roles for HAMP Domains: the Tri-HAMP Region of Pseudomonas aeruginosa Aer2Controls Receptor Signaling and Cellular Localization.
PG  - e0022522
LID - 10.1128/jb.00225-22 [doi]
AB  - The Aer2 chemoreceptor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an O2 sensor involved instress responses, virulence, and tuning the behavior of the chemotaxis (Che)system. Aer2 is the sole receptor of the Che2 system. It is soluble, but membraneassociated, and forms complexes at the cell pole during stationary phase. Thedomain arrangement of Aer2 is unusual, with a PAS sensing domain sandwichedbetween five HAMP domains, followed by a C-terminal kinase-control output domain.The first three HAMP domains form a poly-HAMP chain N-terminal to the PAS sensingdomain. HAMP domains are often located between signal input and output domains,where they transduce signals. Given that HAMP1 to 3 reside N-terminal to theinput-output pathway, we undertook a systematic examination of their function in Aer2. We found that HAMP1 to 3 influence PAS signaling over a considerabledistance, as the majority of HAMP1, 2 and 3 mutations, and deletions of helicalphase stutters, led to nonresponsive signal-off or off-biased receptors. PASsignal-on lesions that mimic activated Aer2 also failed to override N-terminalHAMP signal-off replacements. This indicates that HAMP1 to 3 are criticalcoupling partners for PAS signaling and likely function as a cohesive unit andmoveable scaffold to correctly orient and poise PAS dimers for O2-mediatedsignaling in Aer2. HAMP1 additionally controlled the clustering and polarlocalization of Aer2 in P. aeruginosa. Localization was not driven by HAMP1charge, and HAMP1 signal-off mutants still localized. Employing HAMP as aclustering and localization determinant, as well as a facilitator of PASsignaling, are newly recognized roles for HAMP domains. IMPORTANCE P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that interprets environmental stimuli via 26chemoreceptors that signal through 4 distinct chemosensory systems. The secondchemosensory system, Che2, contains a receptor named Aer2 that senses O2 andmediates stress responses and virulence and tunes chemotactic behavior. Aer2 ismembrane associated, but soluble, and has three N-terminal HAMP domains (HAMP1 to3) that reside outside the signal input-output pathway of Aer2. In this study, wedetermined that HAMP1 to 3 facilitate O2-dependent signaling from the PAS sensingdomain and that HAMP1 controls the formation of Aer2-containing polar foci in P. aeruginosa. Both of these are newly recognized roles for HAMP domains that may beapplicable to other non-signal-transducing HAMP domains and poly-HAMP chains.

TI  - How Escherichia coli Became the Flagship Bacterium of Molecular Biology.
PG  - e0023022
LID - 10.1128/jb.00230-22 [doi]
AB  - Escherichia coli is likely the most studied organism and was instrumental indeveloping many fundamental concepts in biology. But why E. coli? In the 1940s,E. coli was well suited for the biochemical and genetic research that blended to become the seminal field of biochemical genetics and led to the realization that processes already known to occur in complex organisms were conserved in bacteria.This now-obvious concept, combined with the advantages offered by its easycultivation, ultimately drove many researchers to shift from the complexity ofeukaryotic models to the simpler bacterial system, which eventually led to thedevelopment of molecular biology. As knowledge and experimental tools amassed, a positive-feedback loop fixed the central role of E. coli in research. However,given the vast diversity among bacteria and even among E. coli strains, it was bymany fortuitous events that E. coli rose to the top as an experimental model.Here, we share how serendipity and its own biology selected E. coli as theflagship bacterium of molecular biology.

TI  - Microbiota of the Pregnant Mouse: Characterization of the Bacterial Communitiesin the Oral Cavity, Lung, Intestine, and Vagina through Culture and DNASequencing.
PG  - e0128622
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01286-22 [doi]
AB  - Mice are frequently used as animal models for mechanistic studies of infectionand obstetrical disease, yet characterization of the murine microbiota duringpregnancy is lacking. The objective of this study was to characterize themicrobiotas of distinct body sites of the pregnant mouse-vagina, oral cavity,intestine, and lung-that harbor microorganisms that could potentially invade the murine amniotic cavity, thus leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Themicrobiotas of these body sites were characterized through anoxic, hypoxic, andoxic culture as well as through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. With the exception ofthe vagina, the cultured microbiotas of each body site varied by atmosphere, withthe greatest diversity in the cultured microbiota appearing under anoxicconditions. Only cultures of the vagina were comprehensively representative ofthe microbiota observed through direct DNA sequencing of body site samples,primarily due to the predominance of two Rodentibacter strains. Identified asRodentibacter pneumotropicus and Rodentibacter heylii, these isolates exhibitedpredominance patterns similar to those of Lactobacillus crispatus andLactobacillus iners in the human vagina. Whole-genome sequencing of theseRodentibacter strains revealed shared genomic features, including the ability to degrade glycogen, an abundant polysaccharide in the vagina. In summary, we reportbody site-specific microbiotas in the pregnant mouse with potential ecologicalparallels to those of humans. Importantly, our findings indicate that the vaginalmicrobiotas of pregnant mice can be readily cultured, suggesting that mockvaginal microbiotas can be tractably generated and maintained for experimentalmanipulation in future mechanistic studies of host vaginal-microbiomeinteractions. IMPORTANCE Mice are widely utilized as animal models of obstetricalcomplications; however, the characterization of the murine microbiota duringpregnancy has been neglected. Microorganisms from the vagina, oral cavity,intestine, and lung have been found in the intra-amniotic space, where theirpresence threatens the progression of gestation. Here, we characterized themicrobiotas of pregnant mice and established the appropriateness of culture incapturing the microbiota at each site. The high relative abundance ofRodentibacter observed in the vagina is similar to that of Lactobacillus inhumans, suggesting potential ecological parallels. Importantly, we report thatthe vaginal microbiota of the pregnant mouse can be readily cultured underhypoxic conditions, demonstrating that mock microbial communities can be utilizedto test the potential ecological parallels between microbiotas in human andmurine pregnancy and to evaluate the relevance of the structure of thesemicrobiotas for adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially intra-amniotic infectionand preterm birth.

TI  - Role of Chromosome- and/or Plasmid-Located blaNDM on the Carbapenem Resistanceand the Gene Stability in Escherichia coli.
PG  - e0058722
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00587-22 [doi]
AB  - The spread of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing Enterobacteralesrepresents a public health risk. The horizontal transfer of plasmids encoding theNDM gene, blaNDM, usually mediates its spread to other bacteria within thefamily. In contrast, Enterobacterales with a chromosome-located blaNDM is rarely reported. The phenotypic differences between chromosome- and plasmid-locatedcarbapenemase genes are poorly understood. To determine the significance in termsof the location of drug resistance genes, we examined carbapenemase activity and stability of chromosome- and plasmid-located blaNDM. Escherichia coli M719possessing both chromosomes- and plasmid-located blaNDM genes was used as awild-type strain (WT) for the construction of mutants, DeltapblaNDM andDeltacblaNDM, wherein chromosome- or plasmid-located blaNDM, was knocked out,respectively. The mutant DeltapblaNDM showed lower hydrolyzing activity againstimipenem and gene expression than the WT or DeltacblaNDM mutant. The MICs of bothmutant strains were still above the breakpoint of imipenem and meropenem.Moreover, the chromosome-located blaNDM gene was stable for at least 30 days inthe absence of antimicrobial pressure, whereas the DeltacblaNDM mutant lostblaNDM to 87% at 30 days compared to that of the initial inoculum. Organismsharboring the plasmid-located carbapenemase genes were found to provide a higher level of carbapenem resistance than those with chromosome-located genes. However,the latter organisms with chromosomal carbapenemase genes exhibited more stablecarbapenem resistance than did the former ones. In summary, chromosomally locatedcarbapenemase genes require further monitoring and more attention should be paid to them. IMPORTANCE Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) carrying blaNDMhave spread worldwide since they were first reported in 2009. Many studies using whole-genome sequencing have identified the genetic structures, plasmid scaffoldsof blaNDM, and mechanisms of spread via horizontal transfer. Chromosome-locatedblaNDM and integration mechanisms from plasmids have rarely been reported, andtheir significance is not fully understood. Here, we showed that thechromosome-located blaNDM was associated with lower levels of carbapenemresistance and carbapenemase activity than the plasmid-located blaNDM. However,it conferred carbapenem resistance above the breakpoints and the loss ofchromosome-located blaNDM was not observed in the absence of antibiotic pressure.This study suggests that CRE strains carrying chromosome-located blaNDM maypersist in clinical and environmental settings for a long period even withoutantibiotic pressure and need to be monitored along with plasmid-located blaNDM.

TI  - Comparison of the Treatment Outcome of Piperacillin-Tazobactam versus Carbapenemsfor Patients with Bacteremia Caused by Extended-Spectrum beta-Lactamase-ProducingEscherichia coli in Areas with Low Frequency of Coproduction of OXA-1: aPreliminary Analysis.
PG  - e0220622
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02206-22 [doi]
AB  - Although piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) was shown to be less effective thancarbapenems in treating bacteremia due to extended-spectrumbeta-lactamase-producing (ESBL)-producing organisms in a randomized controlledtrial, the fact that many of the causative organisms co-producedinhibitor-resistant OXA-1 along with ESBLs may have influenced the results. Inthis study, we compared the therapeutic effectiveness of TZP and carbapenem intreating ESBL-producing Escherichia coli bacteremia in areas with low frequencyof OXA-1 co-production. Forty patients, 14 in the TZP treatment group and 26 inthe carbapenem treatment group, were included in the analysis. There were nosignificant differences in patient background between the two groups. Urinarytract infection or cholangitis was the source of bacteremia in 26 patients (65%),and the Pitt bacteremia score was zero or one in 35 patients (87.5%). Only four(11.4%) of the 35 causative isolates available for microbiological analysisharbored blaOXA-1, and only three (8.6%) were non-susceptible to TZP. Seventeen(48.6%) isolates carried blaCTX-M-27, none of which carried other beta-lactamase genes. No significant difference in the frequency of treatment failure on day 14 of bacteremia was documented between the TZP and carbapenem treatment groups inboth the crude analysis and the inverse probability of treatmentweighting-adjusted analysis. This study demonstrates that TZP may be a treatment option for non-severe cases of ESBL-producing E. coli bacteremia in areas withlow frequency of OXA-1 co-production. IMPORTANCE Although carbapenems areconsidered the drug of choice for severe infections caused by extended-spectrumbeta-lactamase-producing (ESBL)-producing organisms, other therapeutic optionsare being explored to avoid increasing the selective pressure forcarbapenem-resistant organisms. In this study, it was suggested thatpiperacillin-tazobactam may be as effective as carbapenems for the treatment ofmild bacteremia caused by ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in areas where OXA-1co-production by ESBL-producing E. coli is rare. The genetic background of eachregional epidemic clone differs even among multidrug-resistant bacteriaclassified under the same name (e.g., ESBL-producing organisms), resulting inpossible differences in the efficacy of therapeutic agents. Exploration oftreatment options for multidrug-resistant organisms according to localepidemiology is worthwhile from the perspective of antimicrobial stewardship.

LID - 10.1128/jcm.02210-21 [doi]
AB  - A vast amount of antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) data is generated fromroutine testing in diagnostic laboratories for the primary purpose of guidingclinicians in antimicrobial therapy decisions for their patients. However, there is additional value for these data when they are compiled at the local, regional,national, and global levels. Cumulative AST data can be used to prepareantibiograms at the individual health care facility level. These reports can beused to gain insight into appropriate empirical therapy options prior to theavailability of AST results on an individual patient's isolate. Different typesof cumulative AST data reports can also be compiled at the regional, national,and global levels to estimate susceptibility rates in geographic regions,document trends in evolving microbial populations, and recognize the appearanceand spread of emerging antimicrobial resistance threats. The first CLSI M39Guideline for Analysis and Presentation of Cumulative AST Data was published in2000. Since that time, there have been changes to AST and reportingrecommendations as well as the introduction of advanced informatics technologies to analyze and present data. The 5th edition of M39 has taken into consideration these changes to assist those who analyze, present, and utilize routineantibiograms and other types of cumulative AST data reports as well as those who design information systems for the capturing and analyzing of AST data.Furthermore, antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) have expandedconsiderably, and uses of the antibiogram by ASPs have been addressed. Thisminireview will remind users of the basic recommendations for analysis andpresentation of antibiograms and provide new suggestions to enhance thesereports.

LID - 10.1128/jcm.00254-22 [doi]
AB  - Prior studies have demonstrated prolonged presence of yellow fever virus (YFV)RNA in saliva and urine as an alternative to serum. To investigate the presenceof YFV RNA in urine, we used RT-PCR for YFV screening in 60 urine samplescollected from a large cohort of naturally infected yellow fever (YF) patientsduring acute and convalescent phases of YF infection from recent YF outbreaks in Brazil (2017 to 2018). Fifteen urine samples from acute phase infection (up to 15days post-symptom onset) and four urine samples from convalescent phase infection(up to 69 days post-symptom onset), were YFV PCR-positive. We genotyped YFVdetected in seven urine samples (five collected during the acute phase and twocollected during the YF convalescent phase). Genotyping indicated the presence ofYFV South American I genotype in these samples. To our knowledge, this is thefirst report of wild-type YFV RNA detection in the urine this far out fromsymptom onset (up to 69 DPS), including YFV RNA detection during the convalescentphase of YF infection. The detection of YFV RNA in urine is an indicative of YFV infection; however, the results of RT-PCR using urine as sample should beinterpreted with care, since a negative result does not exclude the possibilityof YFV infection. With a possible prolonged period of detection beyond theviremic phase, the use of urine samples coupled with serological tests,epidemiologic inquiry, and clinical assessment could provide a longer diagnostic window for laboratory YF diagnosis.

TI  - Reduction of a Heme Cofactor Initiates N-Nitroglycine Degradation by NnlA.
PG  - e0102322
LID - 10.1128/aem.01023-22 [doi]
AB  - Linear nitramines are potentially carcinogenic environmental contaminants. TheNnlA enzyme from Variovorax sp. strain JS1663 degrades the nitramineN-nitroglycine (NNG)-a natural product produced by some bacteria-to glyoxylateand nitrite (NO2(-)). Ammonium (NH4(+)) was predicted as the third product ofthis reaction. A source of nonheme Fe(II) was shown to be required for initiationof NnlA activity. However, the role of this Fe(II) for NnlA activity was unclear.This study reveals that NnlA contains a b-type heme cofactor. Reduction of thisheme-either by a nonheme iron source or dithionite-is required to initiate NnlAactivity. Therefore, Fe(II) is not an essential substrate for holoenzymeactivity. Our data show that reduced NnlA (Fe(II)-NnlA) catalyzes at least 100turnovers and does not require O2. Finally, NH4(+) was verified as the thirdproduct, accounting for the complete nitrogen mass balance. Size exclusionchromatography showed that NnlA is a dimer in solution. Additionally, Fe(II)-NnlAis oxidized by O2 and NO2(-) and stably binds carbon monoxide (CO) and nitricoxide (NO). These are characteristics shared with heme-binding PAS domains.Furthermore, a structural homology model of NnlA was generated using the PASdomain from Pseudomonas aeruginosa Aer2 as a template. The structural homologymodel suggested His(73) is the axial ligand of the NnlA heme. Site-directedmutagenesis of His(73) to alanine decreased the heme occupancy of NnlA andeliminated NNG activity, validating the homology model. We conclude that NnlAforms a homodimeric heme-binding PAS domain protein that requires reduction forinitiation of the activity. IMPORTANCE Linear nitramines are potentialcarcinogens. These compounds result from environmental degradation of high-energycyclic nitramines and as by-products of carbon capture technologies. Mechanistic understanding of the biodegradation of these compounds is critical to informstrategies for their remediation. Biodegradation of NNG by NnlA from Variovoraxsp. strain JS 1663 requires nonheme iron, but its role is unclear. This studyshows that nonheme iron is unnecessary. Instead, our study reveals that NnlAcontains a heme cofactor, the reduction of which is critical for activating NNGdegradation activity. These studies constrain the proposals for NnlA reactionmechanisms, thereby informing mechanistic studies of degradation of anthropogenicnitramine contaminants. In addition, these results will inform future work todesign biocatalysts to degrade these nitramine contaminants.

TI  - Induction of Interferon-Stimulated Genes Correlates with Reduced Growth ofInfluenza A Virus in Lungs after RIG-I Agonist Treatment of Ferrets.
PG  - e0055922
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00559-22 [doi]
AB  - Intracellular RIG-I receptors represent key innate sensors of RNA virusinfection, and RIG-I activation results in the induction of hundreds of hosteffector genes, including interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Synthetic RNAagonists targeting RIG-I have shown promise as antivirals against a broadspectrum of viruses, including influenza A virus (IAV), in both in vitro andmouse models of infection. Herein, we demonstrate that treatment of a ferretairway epithelial (FRL) cell line with a RIG-I agonist rapidly and potentlyinduced expression of a broad range of ISGs and resulted in potent inhibition of growth of different IAV strains. In ferrets, a single intravenous injection ofRIG-I agonist was associated with upregulated ISG expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lung tissue, but not in nasal tissues. In a ferret model ofviral contact transmission, a single treatment of recipient animals 24 h prior tocohousing with IAV-infected donors did not reduce virus transmission and sheddingbut did result in reduced lung virus titers 6 days after treatment. A singletreatment of the IAV-infected donor animals also resulted in reduced virus titersin the lungs 2 days later. Thus, a single intravenous treatment with RIG-Iagonist prior to infection or to ferrets with an established IAV infection canreduce virus growth in the lungs. These findings support further development ofRIG-I agonists as effective antiviral treatments to limit the impact of IAVinfections, particularly in reducing virus replication in the lower airways.IMPORTANCE RIG-I agonists have shown potential as broad-spectrum antivirals invitro and in mouse models of infection. However, their antiviral potential hasnot been reported in outbred animals such as ferrets, which are widely regardedas the gold standard small animal model for human IAV infections. Herein, wedemonstrate that RIG-I agonist treatment of a ferret airway cell line resulted inISG induction and inhibition of a broad range of human influenza viruses. Asingle intravenous treatment of ferrets also resulted in systemic induction ofISGs, including in lung tissue, and when delivered to animals prior to IAVexposure or to animals with established IAV infection treatment resulted inreduced virus replication in the lungs. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of single RIG-I treatment against IAV in the ferret model and highlight theimportance of future studies to optimize treatment regimens and delivery routesto maximize their ability to ameliorate IAV infections.

TI  - Deep Population Genomics Reveals Systematic and Parallel Evolution at aLipopolysaccharide Biosynthetic Locus in Xanthomonas Pathogens That Infect Riceand Sugarcane.
PG  - e0055022
LID - 10.1128/aem.00550-22 [doi]
AB  - The advent of high-throughput sequencing and population genomics has enabledresearchers to investigate selection pressure at hypervariable genomic lociencoding pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) molecules likelipopolysaccharide (LPS). Xanthomonas is a model and a major group ofphytopathogenic bacteria that infect hosts in tissue-specific manner. Ourin-depth population-based genomic investigation revealed the emergence of majorlineages in two Xanthomonas pathogens that infect xylem of rice and sugarcane is associated with the acquisition and later large-scale replacement by distincttype of LPS cassettes. In the population of the rice xylem pathogen, Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and sugarcane pathogens Xanthomonas sacchari (Xsac) andXanthomonas vasicola (Xvv), the BXO8 type of LPS cassette is replaced by a BXO1type of cassette in Xoo and by Xvv type LPS cassette in Xsac and Xvv. Thesefindings suggest a wave of parallel evolution at an LPS locus mediated byhorizontal gene transfer (HGT) events during its adaptation and emergence. Aside from xylem pathogens, two closely related lineages of Xoo that infect parenchyma of rice and Leersia hexandra grass have acquired an LPS cassette from Xanthomonaspathogens that infect parenchyma of citrus, walnut, and strawberries, indicating yet another instance of parallel evolution mediated by HGT at an LPS locus. Ourtargeted and megapopulation-based genome dynamic studies revealed the acquisitionand dominance of specific types of LPS cassettes in adaptation and success of amajor group of phytopathogenic bacteria. IMPORTANCE Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is amajor microbe associated molecular pattern and hence a major immunomodulator. As a major and outer member component, it is expected that LPS is a frontlinedefense mechanism to deal with different host responses. Limited studies haveindicated that LPS loci are also highly variable at strain and species level inplant-pathogenic bacteria, suggesting strong selection pressure from plants andassociated niches. The advent of high-throughput genomics has led to theavailability of a large set of genomic resources at taxonomic and populationlevels. This provides an exciting and important opportunity to carryout megascaletargeted and population-based comparative genomic/association studies atimportant loci like those encoding LPS biosynthesis to understand their role inthe evolution of the host, tissue specificity, and also predominant lineages.Such studies will also fill major gap in understanding host and tissuespecificity in pathogenic bacteria. Our pioneering study uses the Xanthomonasgroup of phytopathogens that are known for their characteristic host and tissuespecificity. The present deep phylogenomics of diverse Xanthomonas species andits members revealed lineage association and dominance of distinct types of LPSin accordance with their origin, host, tissue specificity, and evolutionarysuccess.

TI  - Genomic Analysis Reveals Adaptation of Vibrio campbellii to the Hadal Ocean.
PG  - e0057522
LID - 10.1128/aem.00575-22 [doi]
AB  - The genus Vibrio is characterized by high metabolic flexibility and genomeplasticity and is widely distributed in the ocean from euphotic layers todeep-sea environments. The relationship between genome features and environmentaladaptation strategies of Vibrio has been extensively investigated in coastalenvironments, yet very little is known about their survival strategies inoligotrophic deep-sea. In this study, we compared genomes of five Vibriocampbellii strains isolated from the Mariana and Yap Trenches at different water depths, including two epipelagic strains and three hadopelagic strains, toidentify genomic characteristics that facilitate survival in the deep sea. Genomestreamlining is found in pelagic strains, such as smaller genome sizes, lower G+Ccontents, and higher gene densities, which might be caused by long-term residencein an oligotrophic environment. Phylogenetic results showed that these fiveVibrio strains are clustered into two clades according to their collection depth.Indeed, hadopelagic isolates harbor more genes involved in amino acid metabolism and transport, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis, and inorganic iontransport and metabolism through comparative genomics analysis. Specificmacrolide export gene and more tellurite resistance genes present in hadopelagic strains by the annotation of antibiotic and metal resistance genes. In addition, several genes related to substrate degradation are enriched in hadopelagicstrains, such as chitinase genes, neopullulanase genes, and biopolymertransporter genes. In contrast, epipelagic strains are unique in their capacityfor assimilatory nitrate reduction. The genomic characteristics investigated hereprovide insights into how Vibrio adapts to the deep-sea environment throughgenomic evolution. IMPORTANCE With the development of deep-sea samplingtechnology, an increasing number of deep-sea Vibrio strains have been isolated,but the adaptation mechanism of these eutrophic Vibrio strains to the deep-seaenvironment is unclear. Here, our results show that the genome of pelagic Vibrio is streamlined to adapt to a long-term oligotrophic environment. Through aphylogenomic analysis, we find that genomic changes in marine Vibrio campbelliistrains are related to water depth. Our data suggest that an increase in genesrelated to antibiotic resistance, degradation of macromolecular and refractorysubstrates, and utilization of rare ions is related to the adaptation of V.campbellii strains to adapt to hadal environments, and most of the increasedgenes were acquired by horizontal gene transfer. These findings may deepen ourunderstanding of adaptation strategies of marine bacteria to the extremeenvironment in hadal zones.

TI  - The Proteome of Extracellular Vesicles Produced by the Human Gut BacteriaBacteroides thetaiotaomicron In Vivo Is Influenced by Environmental andHost-Derived Factors.
PG  - e0053322
LID - 10.1128/aem.00533-22 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) released from both Gram-negative andGram-positive bacteria provide an effective means of communication andtrafficking of cell signaling molecules. In the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) BEVsproduced by members of the intestinal microbiota can impact host health bymediating microbe-host cell interactions. A major unresolved question, however,is what factors influence the composition of BEV proteins and whether the hostinfluences protein packaging into BEVs and secretion into the GIT. To addressthis, we have analyzed the proteome of BEVs produced by the major human gutsymbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron both in vitro and in vivo in the murine GITin order to identify proteins specifically enriched in BEVs produced in vivo. We identified 113 proteins enriched in BEVs produced in vivo, the majority (62/113) of which accumulated in BEVs in the absence of any changes in their expression bythe parental cells. Among these selectively enriched proteins, we identifieddipeptidyl peptidases and an asparaginase and confirmed their increased activity in BEVs produced in vivo. We also showed that intact BEVs are capable ofdegrading bile acids via a bile salt hydrolase. Collectively these findingsprovide additional evidence for the dynamic interplay of host-microbeinteractions in the GIT and the existence of an active mechanism to drive andenrich a selected group of proteins for secretion into BEVs in the GIT.IMPORTANCE The gastrointestinal tract (GIT) harbors a complex community ofmicrobes termed the microbiota that plays a role in maintaining the host's healthand wellbeing. How this comes about and the nature of microbe-host cellinteractions in the GIT is still unclear. Recently, nanosized vesicles naturally produced by bacterial constituents of the microbiota have been shown to influenceresponses of different host cells although the molecular basis and identity ofvesicle-born bacterial proteins that mediate these interactions is unclear. Weshow here that bacterial extracellular vesicles (BEVs) produced by the humansymbiont Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron in the GIT are enriched in a set ofproteins and enzymes, including dipeptidyl peptidases, an asparaginase and a bilesalt hydrolase that can influence host cell biosynthetic pathways. Our resultsprovide new insights into the molecular basis of microbiota-host interactionsthat are central to maintaining GIT homeostasis and health.

AB  - Sialidases are glycosyl hydrolase enzymes targeting the glycosidic bond betweenterminal sialic acids and underlying sugars. The NanH sialidase of Tannerellaforsythia, one of the bacteria associated with severe periodontal disease plays arole in virulence. Here we show that this broad-specificity enzyme (but higheraffinity for alpha2,3 over alpha2,6 linked sialic acids) digests complex glycans but not those containing Neu5,9Ac. Furthermore we show it to be a highly stabledimeric enzyme and present a thorough structural analysis of the native enzyme inits apo-form and in complex with a sialic acid analogue/ inhibitor (Oseltamivir).We also use non-catalytic (D237A) variant to characterise molecular interactions while in complex with the natural substrates 3- and 6-siallylactose. This datasetalso reveals the NanH Carbohydrate Binding Module (CBM, CAZy CBM 93) has a novel fold made of antiparallel beta-strands. The catalytic domain structure containsnovel features that include a non-prolyl cis-peptide and an uncommon argininesidechain rotamer (R306) proximal to the active site. Via a mutagenesisprogramme, we identified key active site residues (D237, R212 and Y518) andprobed the effects of mutation of residues in proximity to the glycosidic linkagewithin 2,3 and 2,6-linked substrates. These data revealed that mutagenesis ofR306 and residues S235 & V236 adjacent to the acid-base catalyst D237 influencethe linkage specificity preference of this bacterial sialidase, opening uppossibilities for enzyme engineering for glycotechology applications andproviding key structural information that for in silico design of specificinhibitors of this enzyme for treatment of periodontitis.

TI  - Total RNA sequencing of Phlebotomus chinensis, a neglected vector in China,simultaneously revealed viral, bacterial, and eukaryotic microbes that arepotentially pathogenic to humans.
PG  - 1-58

AB  - Phlebotomus chinensis sandfly is a neglected insect vector in China which iswell-known for carrying Leishmania. Recent studies have expanded its pathogenrepertoire with two novel arthropod-borne phleboviruses capable of infectinghuman and animals. Despite these discoveries, our knowledge on the generalpathogen diversity and overall microbiome composition of this vector species are still very limited. Here we carried out a meta-transcriptomics analysis whichsimultaneously revealed the actively replicating/transcribing RNA viruses, DNAviruses, bacteria and eukaryotic microbes, namely, "total microbiome", of severalsandfly populations in China. Strikingly, "microbiome" made up 1.8% of totalnon-ribosomal RNA and were comprised of more than 87 species, among which 70 werenovel, including divergent members of the genera Flavivirus and of the familyTrypanosomatidae. Importantly, among these microbes we were able to reveal fourdistinguished types of human and/or mammalian pathogens, including twophleboviruses (hedi and wuxiang viruses), one novel Spotted fever grouprickettsia, as well as a member of Leishmania donovani complex, among which hedi virus and Leishmania each had > 50% pool prevalence rate and relatively highabundance levels. Our study also showed the ubiquitous presence of anendosymbiont, namely Wolbachia, although no anti-viral or anti-pathogen effectwere detected based on our data. In summary, our results uncovered the muchun-explored diversity of microbes harbored by sandflies in China and demonstratedthat high pathogen diversity and abundance is currently present in multiplepopulations, implying disease potential for exposed local human population ordomestic animals.

TI  - Virome of Giant Panda-Infesting Ticks Reveals Novel Bunyaviruses and OtherViruses That Are Genetically Close to Those from Giant Pandas.
PG  - e0203422
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.02034-22 [doi]
AB  - Tick infestations have been reported as one of the factors threatening the healthof giant pandas, but studies of viral pathogens carried by ticks feeding on theblood of giant pandas are limited. To assess whether blood-sucking ticks of giantpandas can carry viral pathogens and if so, whether the viruses in ticks areassociated with those previously detected in giant panda hosts, we determined theviromes of ticks detached from giant pandas in a field stocking area in SichuanProvince, southwest China. Using viral metagenomics we identified 32 viralspecies in ticks, half of which (including anellovirus [n = 9], circovirus [n =3], and gemycircularvirus [n = 4]) showed homology to viruses carried by giantpandas and their associated host species (such as red pandas and mosquitoes) inthe same living domain. Remarkably, several viruses in this studyphylogenetically assigned as bunyavirus, hepe-like virus, and circovirus weredetected with relatively high abundance, but whether these newly identifiedtick-associated viruses can replicate in ticks and then transmit to host animals during a blood meal will require further investigation. These findings furtherexpand our understanding of the role of giant panda-infesting ticks in the local ecosystem, especially related to viral acquisition and transmission, and lay afoundation to assess the risk for giant panda exposure to tick-borne viruses.IMPORTANCE Ticks rank only second to mosquitoes as blood-feeding arthropods,capable of spreading pathogens (including viruses, bacteria, and parasites) tohosts during a blood meal. To better understand the relationship between viruses carried by ticks and viruses that have been reported in giant pandas, it isnecessary to analyze the viromes of giant panda-parasitic blood-sucking ticks.This study collected 421 ticks on the body surface of giant pandas in SichuanProvince, China. We characterized the extensive genetic diversity of virusesharbored by these ticks and reported frequent communication of viruses betweengiant pandas and their ticks. While most of the virome discovered here arenonpathogenic viruses from giant pandas and potentially tick-specific viruses, werevealed some possible tick-borne viruses, represented by novel bunyaviruses.This research contributes to the literature because currently there are fewstudies on the virome of giant panda-infesting ticks.

TI  - High Levels of Cyclic Diguanylate Interfere with Beneficial BacterialColonization.

LID - 10.1128/mbio.01671-22 [doi]
AB  - During colonization of the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), Vibriofischeri bacteria undergo a lifestyle transition from a planktonic motile statein the environment to a biofilm state in host mucus. Cyclic diguanylate(c-di-GMP) is a cytoplasmic signaling molecule that is important for regulatingmotility-biofilm transitions in many bacterial species. V. fischeri encodes 50proteins predicted to synthesize and/or degrade c-di-GMP, but a role for c-di-GMPregulation during host colonization has not been investigated. We examinedstrains exhibiting either low or high levels of c-di-GMP during squidcolonization and found that while a low-c-di-GMP strain had no colonizationdefect, a high c-di-GMP strain was severely impaired. Expression of aheterologous c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase restored colonization, demonstrating thatthe effect is due to high c-di-GMP levels. In the constitutive high-c-di-GMPstate, colonizing V. fischeri exhibited reduced motility, altered biofilmaggregate morphology, and a regulatory interaction where transcription of onepolysaccharide locus is inhibited by the presence of the other polysaccharide.Our results highlight the importance of proper c-di-GMP regulation duringbeneficial animal colonization, illustrate multiple pathways regulated byc-di-GMP in the host, and uncover an interplay of multiple exopolysaccharidesystems in host-associated aggregates. IMPORTANCE There is substantial interestin studying cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) in pathogenic and environmentalbacteria, which has led to an accepted paradigm in which high c-di-GMP levelspromote biofilm formation and reduce motility. However, considerably less focushas been placed on understanding how this compound contributes to beneficialcolonization. Using the Vibrio fischeri-Hawaiian bobtail squid study system, wetook advantage of recent genetic advances in the bacterium to modulate c-di-GMPlevels and measure colonization and track c-di-GMP phenotypes in a symbioticinteraction. Studies in the animal host revealed a c-di-GMP-dependent geneticinteraction between two distinct biofilm polysaccharides, Syp and cellulose, thatwas not evident in culture-based studies: elevated c-di-GMP altered thecomposition and abundance of the in vivo biofilm by decreasing syp transcription due to increased cellulose synthesis. This study reveals important parallelsbetween pathogenic and beneficial colonization and additionally identifiesc-di-GMP-dependent regulation that occurs specifically in the squid host.

TI  - Indole Sensing Regulator (IsrR) Promotes Virulence Gene Expression in EntericPathogens.
PG  - e0193922
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01939-22 [doi]
AB  - Enteric pathogens such as enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and its surrogatemurine model Citrobacter rodentium sense indole levels within the gut to navigateits biogeography and modulate virulence gene expression. Indole is amicrobiota-derived signal that is more abundant in the intestinal lumen, with itsconcentration decreasing at the epithelial lining where it is absorbed. E. coli, but not C. rodentium, produces endogenous indole because it harbors the tnaAgene. Microbiota-derived exogenous indole is sensed by the CpxAR two-componentsystem, where CpxA is a membrane-bound histidine-sensor-kinase (HK) and CpxR is aresponse regulator (RR). Indole inhibits CpxAR function leading to decreasedexpression of the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island,which is essential for these pathogens to form lesions on enterocytes. In ourtranscriptome studies comparing wild-type (WT) EHEC and DeltatnaA +/- indole, oneof the most upregulated genes by indole is ygeV, which is a predicted orphan RR. Because of the role YgeV plays in the indole signaling cascade, we renamed thisgene indole sensing regulator (isrR). In the absence of endogenous indole, IsrRactivates LEE gene expression. IsrR only responds to endogenous indole, withexogenous indole still blocking virulence gene expression independently fromIsrR. Notably, a C. rodentium isrR mutant is attenuated for murine infection,depicting delayed death, lower intestinal colonization, and LEE gene expression. IsrR aids in discriminating between microbiota-derived (exogenous) and endogenousself-produced indole in fine-tuning virulence gene expression by entericpathogens in the intestine. IMPORTANCE Enteric pathogens sense the complexintestinal chemistry to find a suitable colonization niche. The microbiota plays an important part in shaping this chemistry. Here we show that the abundantmicrobiota-derived exogenous signal indole impacts host-pathogen interactions by allowing enteric pathogens to discriminate between the luminal environment, whereexpression of virulence genes is an unnecessary energy burden, from theepithelial surface, where this gene expression is needed for host colonization.We describe a new signaling node through the regulator IsrR that allows for this shift. These findings establish a mechanism through which pathogens discriminate from self- and microbiota-derived signaling to establish infection.

TI  - A Variant Allele in Varicella-Zoster Virus Glycoprotein B Selected duringProduction of the Varicella Vaccine Contributes to Its Attenuation.
PG  - e0186422
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01864-22 [doi]
AB  - Attenuation of the live varicella Oka vaccine (vOka) has been attributed tomutations in the genome acquired during cell culture passage of pOka (parentstrain); however, the precise mechanisms of attenuation remain unknown.Comparative sequence analyses of several vaccine batches showed that over 100single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are conserved across all vaccine batches; 6 SNPs are nearly fixed, suggesting that these SNPs are responsible forattenuation. By contrast, prior analysis of chimeric vOka and pOka recombinantsindicates that loci other than these six SNPs contribute to attenuation. Here, wereport that pOka consists of a heterogenous population of virus sequences withtwo nearly equally represented bases, guanine (G) or adenine (A), at nucleotide2096 of the ORF31 coding sequence, which encodes glycoprotein B (gB) resulting inarginine (R) or glutamine (Q), respectively, at amino acid 699 of gB. Bycontrast, 2096A/699Q is dominant in vOka (>99.98%). gB699Q/gH/gL showedsignificantly less fusion activity than gB699R/gH/gL in a cell-based fusionassay. Recombinant pOka with gB669Q (rpOka_gB699Q) had a similar growth phenotypeas vOka during lytic infection in cell culture including human primary skincells; however, rpOka_gB699R showed a growth phenotype similar to pOka.rpOka_gB699R entered neurons from axonal terminals more efficiently thanrpOka_gB699Q in the presence of cell membrane-derived vesicles containing gB.Strikingly, when a mixture of pOka with both alleles equally represented was usedto infect human neurons from axon terminals, pOka with gB699R was dominant forvirus entry. These results identify a variant allele in gB that contributes toattenuation of vOka. IMPORTANCE The live-attenuated varicella vaccine has reducedthe burden of chickenpox. Despite its development in 1974, the molecular basisfor its attenuation is still not well understood. Since the live-attenuatedvaricella vaccine is the only licensed human herpesvirus vaccine that preventsprimary disease, it is important to understand the mechanism for its attenuation.Here we identify that a variant allele in glycoprotein B (gB) selected duringgeneration of the varicella vaccine contributes to its attenuation. This variant is impaired for fusion, virus entry into neurons from nerve terminals, andreplication in human skin cells. Identification of a variant allele in gB, one ofthe essential herpesvirus core genes, that contributes to its attenuation mayprovide insights that assist in the development of other herpesvirus vaccines.

TI  - Bacterial invasion into the epidermis of rats with sodium laurylsulphate-irritated skin increases damage and induces incontinence-associateddermatitis.
LID - 10.1111/iwj.13864 [doi]
AB  - Incontinence-associated dermatitis (IAD) is caused by prolonged exposure tourine/liquid stool. It is a common and often painful skin condition in olderincontinent adults because of poor prevention. Patients with urinary infectionsare at risk of developing IAD, and to guide the development of novel preventionstrategies, we aimed to develop an animal model of IAD by urine and bacteria.First, contralateral sites on the dorsal skin of Sprague-Dawley rats werecompromised by sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), simulating frequent cleansing withsoap/water. Filter discs were then placed inside ring-shaped chambers on foamdressings, inoculated with or without Pseudomonas aeruginosa, covered withagarose gels immersed in cultured filtrated urine, and secured in place with anocclusive dressing for 3 days. Untreated and SLS-compromised sites served ascontrols. The IAD was developed at bacteria-inoculated sites, characterised bysevere IAD-like redness that persisted for up to 3 days post-exposure and higher disruption of the skin barrier function compared with non-inoculated sites.Pathological changes included epidermal thickening, partial skin loss,inflammatory cell infiltration, accumulation of red blood cells, and invasion of bacteria into the epidermis. This novel, clinically relevant IAD rat model canserve for future prevention developments.

TI  - Multicentric evaluation of the variability of digital morphology performancesalso respect to the reference methods by optical microscopy.
LID - 10.1111/ijlh.13943 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the important diagnostic role of peripheral bloodmorphology, cell classification is subjective. Automated image-processing systems(AIS) provide more accurate and objective morphological evaluation. The aims ofthis multicenter study were the evaluation of the intra and inter-laboratoryvariation between different AIS in cell pre-classification and afterreclassification, compared with manual optical microscopy, the reference method. METHODS: Six peripheral blood samples were included in this study, for eachsample, 70 May-Grunwald and Giemsa stained PB smears were prepared from eachspecimen and 10 slides were delivered to the seven laboratories involved. Smears were processed by both optical microscopy (OM) and AIS. In addition, theassessment times of both methods were recorded. RESULTS: Within-laboratoryReproducibility ranged between 4.76% and 153.78%; between-laboratory Precisionranged between 2.10% and 82.2%, while Total Imprecision ranged between 5.21% and 20.60%. The relative Bland Altman bias ranged between -0.01% and 20.60%. The meanof assessment times were 326 +/- 110 s and 191 +/- 68 s for AIS postreclassification and OM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: AIS can be helpful when thenumber of cell counted are low and can give advantages in terms of efficiency,objectivity and time saving in the morphological analysis of blood cells. Theycan also help in the interpretation of some morphological features and can serve as learning and investigation tools.

TI  - SCAR marker: A potential tool for authentication of agriculturally importantmicroorganisms.
LID - 10.1002/jobm.202200419 [doi]
AB  - Microbial inoculants are globally recommended for plant growth promotion andcontrol of plant pathogens. These inoculants require stringent quality checks forsustainable field efficacy. Questionable regulatory frameworks constantlydeteriorate the reliability of bio-inoculant technology. Existing globalregulations do not involve any rapid molecular technique for the routineinspection of microbial preparations. Sequence characterized amplified region(SCAR) marker offers rapid and precise strain-level authentication of targetmicrobes. Such advanced molecular techniques must be exploited to accuratelyvalidate the microbial formulations. Besides, the global dissemination of plantpathogenic microbes has always been an alarming threat to food security. SCARmarkers could be used at the plant quarantine centers to rapidly detectcatastrophic pathogens, thereby circumventing the import and export of contagiousplant materials. The current review is focused on promoting the SCAR markertechnology to validate commercial bio-inoculants and predict plant pandemics.

AB  - Early Responsive to Dehydration (ERD) genes are rapidly induced in response tovarious biotic and abiotic stresses, such as bacteria, drought, light,temperature and high salt in Arabidopsis thaliana. Sixteen ERD of Arabidopsisthaliana (AtERD) genes have been previously identified. The lengths of the codingregion of the genes are 504-2838 bp. They encode 137-745 amino acids. In thisstudy, the AtERD genes structure and promoter are analyzed throughbioinformatics, and a overall function is summarized and a systematic signalpathway involving AtERD genes is mapped. AtERD9, AtERD11 and AtERD13 have the GSTdomain. AtERD10 and AtERD14 have the Dehyd domain. The promoters regions contain 32 light responsive elements, 23 ABA responsive elements, 5 drought responsiveelements, 5 meristem expression related elements and 132 core promoter elements. The study provides a theoretical guidance for subsequent studies of AtERD genes.

TI  - Atypical MAPK regulates translocation of GATA transcription factor in response tochemoattractant stimulation.
LID - jcs.260148 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jcs.260148 [doi]
AB  - The Dictyostelium atypical MAPK Erk2 was found to be essential for thecAMP-stimulated translocation of the GATA transcription factor GtaC as indicated by the distribution of a GFP-GtaC reporter. Erk2 was also determined to beessential for the translocation of GtaC in response to external folate, aforaging signal that directs the chemotaxis of amoeba to bacteria. Erk1, the onlyother Dictyostelium MAPK, was not required for the GtaC translocation to eitherchemoattractant, indicating that GFP-GtaC is a kinase translocation reporterspecific for atypical MAPKs. The translocation of GFP-GtaC in response to folate was absent in mutants lacking the folate receptor, Far1, or the coupled G proteinsubunit, G4. Loss of GtaC function resulted in enhanced chemotactic movement tofolate suggesting GtaC suppresses responses to folate. The alteration of fourErk2-preferred phosphorylation sites in GtaC impacted the translocation ofGFP-GtaC in response to folate and the GFP-GtaC rescue of aggregation anddevelopment of gtaC- cells. The ability of different chemoattractants tostimulate Erk2-regulated GtaC translocation suggests that atypical MAPKregulation of transcription factors can contribute to different cell fates.

TI  - Biological roles of toll-like receptors and gut microbiota in colorectal cancer.
LID - 10.2217/fmb-2021-0072 [doi]
AB  - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most considerably common malignancies ofthe alimentary system, with high mortality and incidence rates. The present studysuggested that the occurrence of CRC is closely related to bacteria, as the largeintestine is a gathering place for human micro-organisms. However, thenosogenesis of bacteria leading to tumorigenesis is still obscure. Recently, manystudies have reported that toll-like receptors and their related molecularpathways are involved in the process of gut micro-organisms generating CRC. Gutmicro-organisms can promote or inhibit the development of CRC via binding tospecial toll-like receptors. In this paper, the authors review the relationshipamong toll-like receptors, gut micro-organisms and CRC in order to provide areference for future tumor immunotherapy and targeted therapy.

TI  - Initial research on the effect and mechanism of Tivozanib on pulsed dye laserinduced angiogenesis.
LID - 10.1002/lsm.23586 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pulsed dye laser (PDL) is the main treatment for port wine stain(PWS), but a considerable number of patients show low clearances. The reason for the poor efficacy is related to PDL-induced angiogenesis. Vascular endothelialgrowth factor (VEGF) plays an important role in PDL-induced angiogenesis and can activate the tyrosine kinase activity of VEGF receptor (VEGFR) in endothelialcells. It triggers a full range of responses, and then participates in theregulation of angiogenesis. Tivozanib is an inhibitor of VEGFR tyrosine kinaseactivity, which can block the pro-angiogenic effect of VEGF and reduce vascularpermeability. METHOD: Different energy densities of PDL were used to irradiatethe abdominal skin of rats. According to the general and pathological changes of the irradiated area, the energy density of 8 J/cm(2) with smaller scab andstronger vascular effect was selected for follow-up experiments. Divided the rat abdomen skin into four areas, irradiated three of them uniformly with an energydensity of 8 J/cm(2) , and applied different concentrations of Tivozanib coating agent to the laser irradiation area, and grouped them as follows: (1) vacantgroup, (2) control group, (3) 0.5% Tivozanib group, (4) 1% Tivozanib group.Camera and dermoscopy were used to observe skin changes. Hematoxylin-eosinstaining, immunohistochemical staining, and blood vessels were counted to detect dermal vascular regeneration. Transcriptome sequencing and real-time polymerasechain reaction (PCR) were conducted to elucidate the mechanism and validate thereliability. RESULTS: The number of blood vessels in the 0.5% Tivozanib group and1% Tivozanib group was significantly reduced on the 7, 10, and 14 days comparedwith the control group. The number of blood vessels in the 1% Tivozanib group wassignificantly reduced compared with the 0.5% Tivozanib group, indicating thatTivozanib successfully inhibited PDL-induced angiogenesis, and the inhibitoryeffect of 1% Tivozanib was more significant than that of 0.5% Tivozanib.Transcriptome sequencing results showed a total of 588 significantlydifferentially expressed genes, including 90 upregulated genes and 498downregulated genes. Gene ontology (GO) and kyoto encyclopedia of genes andgenomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that the significantly differentiallyexpressed genes were mainly enriched in the metabolic pathways which were closelyrelated to angiogenesis. Finally, real-time PCR was used to verify the genes withhigher expression differences, the top ranking and closely related toangiogenesis, namely, Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl3, Cxcl6, Ccl3, Csf3, IL1beta, iNOS,Mmp9, Mmp13, Plau, Ets1, Spp1, Nr4a1. The results were consistent with the trend of transcriptome sequencing results, which proved the reliability of this study. CONCLUSION: This study explored the inhibitory effect of Tivozanib on PDL-inducedangiogenesis, and provided a new idea for the treatment of clinical PWS.Transcriptome sequencing explored the mechanism and provided reliable clues forlater in-depth research.

TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic analysis of Edwardsiella isolates from Taiwan indicates wide variation with a particular reference to Edwardsiella tarda and Edwardsiellaanguillarum.
LID - 10.1111/jfd.13688 [doi]
AB  - Edwardsiella spp. is a gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, intracellularbacteria threatening the aquaculture industry worldwide. Noticeably, E. tarda is now genotypically classified into three distinct groups (E. tarda, E. piscicidaand E. anguillarum), but morphologically, it is unclear due to varying degrees ofvirulence in different fish hosts. Hence, to reclassify E. tarda, we investigateddifferences in genotypes, phenotypes and pathogenicity. We collected Edwardsiellaisolates from five different counties of Taiwan between 2017 and 2021. At first, gyrB gene was amplified for a phylogenetic tree from 40 isolates from differentfish and one reference isolate, BCRC10670, from the human. Thirty-nine strainsclustered into E. anguillarum, 1 strain into E. piscicida and 1 strain into E.tarda from human strain. Second, all isolates were characterized using variousphenotypic (API 20E biochemical profiles) and genotypic (pulsed-field gelelectrophoresis [PFGE], and virulence-related gene detection). SpeI digestionrevealed 10 pulsotypes and I-CeuI into 7 pulsotypes. Virulent genes (citC, gadB, katB, mukF and fimA) confirmed in 35, 31, 28, 37 and 38 isolates, respectively.Finally, in vivo challenge test in milkfish (Chanos chanos) indicated the highestmortality from E. anguillarum. Overall, results revealed unique features withEdwardsiella spp. genotypes and pathogenicity, which are relevant to the host andprovide useful insights for future vaccine development.

TI  - IL-22 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii mitigate alcohol-induced exacerbation ofDSS-induced colitis.
LID - 10.1002/JLB.4A0122-068R [doi]
AB  - Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by cycles of active disease flare andinactive disease remission. During UC remission, IL-22 is up-regulated, acting asa hallmark of entrance into UC remission. Recently, we found that in our mousemodel of binge alcohol and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis, alcohol increases severity of UC pathology. In this study, we assessed not only whetheralcohol influenced IL-22 expression and thereby perpetuates UC, but also whether recombinant IL-22 (rIL-22) or treatment with a probiotic could alleviateexacerbated symptoms of UC. Levels of large intestine IL-22 were significantlydecreased approximately 6.9-fold in DSS ethanol compared with DSS vehicle.Examination of lamina propria (LP) cells in the large intestine revealed IL-22+gammadelta T cells in DSS vehicle-treated mice were significantly increased,while IL-22+ gammadelta T cells in DSS ethanol mice were unable to mount thisIL-22 response. We administered rIL-22 and found it restored weight loss of DSSethanol-treated mice. Colonic shortening and increased Enterobacteriaceae werealso attenuated. Administration of Lactobacillus delbrueckii attenuated weightloss (p < 0.01), colon length (p < 0.001), mitigated increases inEnterobacteriaceae, increased levels of IL-22, and increased levels of p-STAT3back to that of DSS vehicle group in DSS ethanol mice. In contrast, soleadministration of L. delbrueckii supernatant was not sufficient to reduce UCexacerbation following alcohol. Our findings suggest L. delbrueckii contributesto repair mechanisms by increasing levels of IL-22, resulting in phosphorylation of STAT3, thus attenuating the alcohol-induced increases in intestinal damageafter colitis.

TI  - When 3D genome technology meets viral infection, including SARS-CoV-2.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.28040 [doi]
AB  - Mammalian chromosomes undergo varying degrees of compression to formthree-dimensional genome structures. These three-dimensional structures undergodynamic and precise chromatin interactions to achieve precise spatial andtemporal regulation of gene expression. Most eukaryotic DNA viruses can invadetheir genomes into the nucleus. However, it is still poorly understood how theviral genome is precisely positioned after entering the host cell nucleus to findthe most suitable location and whether it can specifically interact with the hostgenome to hijack the host transcriptional factories or even integrate into thehost genome to complete its transcription and replication rapidly. Chromosomeconformation capture technology can reveal long-range chromatin interactionsbetween different chromosomal sites in the nucleus, potentially providing areference for viral DNA-host chromatin interactions. This review summarized theresearch progress on the three-dimensional interaction between virus and hostgenome and the impact of virus integration into the host genome on genetranscription regulation, aiming to provide new insights into chromatininteraction and viral gene transcription regulation, laying the foundation forthe treatment of infectious diseases.

TI  - BRAF increases endothelial cell stiffness through reorganization of the actincytoskeleton.
PG  - e22478
LID - 10.1096/fj.202200344R [doi]
AB  - The dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton and its connection to endothelialcell-cell junctions determine the barrier function of endothelial cells. Theproper regulation of barrier opening/closing is necessary for the normal functionof vessels, and its dysregulation can result in chronic and acute inflammationleading to edema formation. By using atomic force microscopy, we show here thatthrombin-induced permeability of human umbilical vein endothelial cells,associated with actin stress fiber formation, stiffens the cell center. Thedepletion of the MEK/ERK kinase BRAF reduces thrombin-induced permeabilityprevents stress fiber formation and cell stiffening. The peripheral actin ringbecomes stabilized by phosphorylated myosin light chain, while cofilin isexcluded from the cell periphery. All these changes can be reverted by theinhibition of ROCK, but not of the MEK/ERK module. We propose that the balancebetween the binding of cofilin and myosin to F-actin in the cell periphery, whichis regulated by the activity of ROCK, determines the local dynamics of actinreorganization, ultimately driving or preventing stress fiber formation.

AB  - PURPOSE: To report the management and outcome of a case of necrotizing scleritis due to Hormographiella aspergillata. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 79-year-oldwoman developed scleral inflammation following accidental trauma with a gorseplant in her left eye. An abscess formed at the site of the injury, which wassurgically drained. Filamentous fungi were identified from the abscess contents, and oral voriconazole and topical voriconazole and natamycin drops wereprescribed. Phenotypic analysis confirmed the presence of Hormographiellaaspergillata, with low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) for voriconazoleand amphotericin B. Two weeks later the patient presented with an area ofnecrotizing scleritis which required surgical debridement and scleral grafting.Three months later, the scleral inflammation had resolved leaving an area ofscleromalacia. CONCLUSIONS: Hormographiella aspergillata is a commonenvironmental fungus that has recently emerged as a human pathogen and a rarecause of scleritis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report ofscleritis in which a pure culture of H. aspergillata was obtained. Successfulmanagement poses a challenge as there are limited reports on antifungalsusceptibility and a combination of medical and surgical treatment is oftenrequired.

AB  - The biogenic synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are gaining attentionbecause they are eco-friendly, non-hazardous, economical and devoid of thedrawbacks of physicochemical processes. Biogenic approaches for synthesizingnanoparticles (NPs) using plant leaves, seeds, bark, stems, fruits, roots andflowers are highly cost-effective compared to other methods. Silver (Ag) has beenused since ancient times, but biogenic AgNPs have only been made in the last few decades. They have been employed primarily in the food and pharmaceuticalindustries as antimicrobials and antioxidants. Recent studies have confirmed thatmany molecules present in different bacteria, including Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter koseri, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi,Klebsipneumoniaoniae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa, are bound to the AgNPs and can be inhibited using multifaceted mechanisms like AgNPs inter inside the cells, free radicals, ROS generation and modulate transductionpathways. Recent breakthroughs in nanobiotechnology-based therapeutics haveopened up new possibilities for fighting microorganisms. Thus, in particular,biogenic AgNPs as powerful antibacterial agents have gained much interest.Surface charge, colloidal state, shape, concentration and size are the mostcritical physicochemical characteristics that determine the antibacterialpotential of AgNPs. Based on this review, it can be stated that AgNPs could bemade better in terms of their potency, durability, accuracy, biosecurity andcompatibility.

AB  - There are limited data on inflammatory cytokines and chemokines; the humoralimmune response; and main clinical laboratory parameters as indicators fordisease severity and mortality in patients with critical and mild COVID-19without comorbidities or immune-mediated diseases in Saudi Arabia. We determined the expression levels of major proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines;C-reactive protein (CRP); procalcitonin; SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody and twenty-twoclinical laboratory parameters and assessed their usefulness as indicators ofdisease severity and in-hospital death. Our results showed a significant increasein the expression levels of SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibody; IL1-beta; IL-6; IL-8;TNF-alpha and CRP in critical COVID-19 patients; neutrophil count; urea;creatinine and troponin were also increased. The elevation of these biomarkerswas significantly associated and positively correlated with in-hospital death in critical COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that the levels of IL1-beta;IL-6; IL-8; TNF-alpha; and CRP; neutrophil count; urea; creatinine; and troponin could be used to predict disease severity in COVID-19 patients withoutcomorbidities or immune-mediated diseases. These inflammatory mediators could be used as predictive early biomarkers of COVID-19 disease deterioration; shock and death among COVID-19 patients without comorbidities or immune-mediated diseases.

TI  - The association of antibody immunity with cryptococcal antigenemia and mortality in a South African cohort with advanced HIV disease.
LID - ciac633 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/cid/ciac633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia (positive blood cryptococcalantigen [CrAg]) is associated with increased mortality in HIV-positiveindividuals even after adjusting for CD4 count and despite receiving antifungaltreatment. The association of antibody immunity with mortality in HIV-positiveadults with cryptococcal antigenemia is unknown. METHODS: Cryptococcus spp.capsular glucuronoxylomannan (GXM)- and naturally occurring beta-glucans(laminarin, curdlan)-binding antibodies were measured in blood samples of 197South Africans living with HIV who underwent CrAg screening and wereprospectively followed up to 6 months. Associations between antibody titers, CrAgstatus and all-cause mortality were sought using logistic and Cox proportionalhazards regression, respectively. RESULTS: Compared to CrAg-negative (n = 130),CrAg-positive individuals (n = 67) had significantly higher IgG1 (median, 6,672[interquartile range, IQR, 4,696-10,414] vs. 5,343 [3,808-7,722]mug/ml; P =0.007), IgG2 (1,467 [813-2,607] vs. 1,036 [519-2,012]mug/ml; P = 0.01), GXM-IgG(1:170 [61-412] vs. 1:117 [47-176]; P = 0.0009) and lower curdlan-IgG (1:47[11-133] vs. 1:93 [40-206]; P = 0.01) titers. GXM-IgG associated directly withcryptococcal antigenemia adjusted for CD4 count and antiretroviral therapy use(odds ratio, 1.64 for each log increase in titer; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.21-2.22). Among CrAg-positive individuals, GXM-IgG inversely associated withmortality at 6 months adjusted for CD4 count and active or prevalent tuberculosis(hazard ratio, 0.50; a two-fold reduction per log increase in titer; 95% CI,0.33-0.77). CONCLUSIONS: The finding of an inverse association of GXM-IgG withmortality in CrAg-positive individuals suggests that GXM-IgG titer may haveprognostic value in such individuals. Prospective longitudinal studies ofantibody levels to investigate this hypothesis and identify mechanisms by whichantibody may protect against mortality are warranted.

TI  - Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Pyrrole-2-carboxamide Derivativesas Mycobacterial Membrane Protein Large 3 Inhibitors for Treating Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis.
LID - 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.2c00718 [doi]
AB  - In this work, pyrrole-2-carboxamides were designed with a structure-guidedstrategy based on the crystal structure of MmpL3 and a pharmacophore model. Thestructure-activity relationship studies revealed that attaching phenyl andpyridyl groups with electron-withdrawing substituents to the pyrrole ring andattaching bulky substituents to the carboxamide greatly improved anti-TBactivity. Most compounds showed potent anti-TB activity (MIC < 0.016 mug/mL) and low cytotoxicity (IC50 > 64 mug/mL). Compound 32 displayed excellent activityagainst drug-resistant tuberculosis, good microsomal stability, almost noinhibition of the hERG K(+) channel, and good in vivo efficacy. Furthermore, the target of the pyrrole-2-carboxamides was identified by measuring their potencyagainst M. smegmatis expressing wild-type and mutated variants of the mmpL3 gene from M. tuberculosis (mmpL3tb) and determining their effect on mycolic acidbiosynthesis using a [(14)C] acetate metabolic labeling assay. The present study provides new MmpL3 inhibitors that are promising anti-TB agents.

TI  - Knowledge, Attitude and Practice of Community Pharmacists in Relation toDispensing Antibiotics Without Prescription in Sudan: A Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - 107-116
LID - 10.2147/IPRP.S363079 [doi]
AB  - Background: Dispensing antibiotics without prescription (DAwP) is a widespreadpractice, especially in developing countries, contributing to antibioticresistance. Community pharmacists play a significant role in promoting rationaluse of antibiotics by refraining from DAwP, and providing drug information topatients. This study aimed to evaluate community pharmacists' knowledge, attitudeand practice, and to assess the factors behind DAwP. Methods: A cross-sectionalstudy was conducted in 2020 among random sample of community pharmacists inSudan. Online semi-structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Theassociation between dependent and independent variables was assessed usingChi-square test; a P-value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Ofthe 1217 pharmacists who participated, the majority were female (n = 645, 53%).Most pharmacists have a B. Pharm degree (n = 1026, 84%) and less than 5 years'experience (n = 718, 59%). Notably, the majority of community pharmacists havegood knowledge (n = 735, 61.7%), which is significantly associated with years of experience (P < 0.00). More than half (n = 623, 52.2%) of the pharmacists haveabove average score of practice. Nearly all the pharmacists who participated havea positive attitude in relation to DAwP (n = 1204, 98.9%). More than half of the pharmacists were DAwP for tonsillitis (n = 817, 67%), wound infection (n = 766,62.9%), and urinary tract infection (n = 664, 54%). The leading factor behindDAwP was the low socioeconomic status of the patients (n = 624, 51%).Additionally, 47% of the pharmacists (n = 572) thought that they wereknowledgeable enough to DAwP. Conclusion: Despite their positive attitude andaverage level of knowledge regarding DAwP, Sudanese community pharmacistsfrequently are DAwP for tonsillitis. Low patients' socioeconomic status was theleading factor behind DAwP. Accordingly, extensive work from health authoritiesto improve the accessibility and affordability of the health system as well asthe development of an antibiotic stewardship program are required to diminishDAwP.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causativeagent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 has been spreadingworldwide since December 2019, resulting in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic with237 million infections and 4.8 million deaths by 11 October 2021. While there aregreat efforts of global vaccination, ending this pandemic has been challenged by issues of exceptionally high viral transmissibility, re-infection,vaccine-breakthrough infection, and immune escape variants of concern. Besidesthe record-breaking speed of vaccine research and development, antiviral drugsincluding SARS-CoV-2-specific human neutralizing antibodies (HuNAbs) have beenactively explored for passive immunization. In support of HuNAb-basedimmunotherapy, passive immunization using convalescent patients' plasma hasgenerated promising evidence on clinical benefits for both mild and severeCOVID-19 patients. Since the source of convalescent plasma is limited, thediscovery of broadly reactive HuNAbs may have significant impacts on the fightagainst the COVID-19 pandemic. In this review, therefore, we discuss the current technologies of gene cloning, modes of action, in vitro and in vivo potency andbreadth, and clinical development for potent SARS-CoV-2-specific HuNAbs.

AB  - Background: Bloodstream infections (BSI) are severe and challenging oncologicalcomplications, with a consequent high morbidity and mortality in theimmunocompromised. We reviewed the profile and susceptibility of bacteriaassociated with infections in children under 13 years of age receivingchemotherapy. Methods: Prospective cohort study of pediatric oncology patientswas conducted between January 2015 and October 2017 at the Royal Hospital inOman. Patient demographics, clinical data, laboratory parameters, microbialetiology and susceptibility, and outcomes were retrieved and analyzed. Results: Atotal of 74 episodes of positive bacterial blood cultures were detected in 38oncology patients (positive blood culture rate of 51%). Fifty-seven percent were positive for gram-negative organisms with Klebsiella (21%) being the most common gram-negative organism cultured, and the most common gram-positive organism wasStaphylococcus (coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CONs) and S. Aureus) (30%).The majority of patients had gastrointestinal complaints (74%), and almost half(51%) had prolonged periods of neutropenia (>7 days). One third of gram-negative organisms were resistant to four or more antibiotics with a major resistance of31% to piperacillin-tazobactam. Of the gram-positive organisms, 38% wereresistant to at least four antibiotics and 30% were pan-resistant (except forvancomycin). Conclusion: The gram-negative organisms were dominant in BSIs withKlebsiella being the most common culprit. Bacteremia was prevalent, however, highresistance to first-line antibiotics was documented amongst gram-negativeisolates, demanding strategies to ensure our patients' safety.

AB  - Background: The association of treatment failure and mortality with vancomycinminimum inhibitory concentration creep (MIC) is a matter of serious concern inpatients with severe methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)infections. The purpose of the study was to identify and characterizestaphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) and clonal types of MRSA strains,exhibiting the vancomycin MIC creep phenomenon. Methods: A total of 3305 S.aureus strains were isolated from various clinical samples of Lahore GeneralHospital, Lahore, Pakistan. MRSA strains were identified by cefoxitin resistant(</=21mm) followed by mecA and mecC gene genotyping. Vancomycin MIC creep wasdetermined by E-test. Isolates having MIC values >1.5 microg/mL were furthersubjected for SCCmec typing (I-V and XI) and multiple-locus variable numbertandem repeat analysis (MLVA) by amplification of spa, sspA, clfA, clfB, andsdrCDE genes. A dendrogram was created based on the similarity index usingbioneumerics software. Results: About 13.3% (440/3305) isolates were MRSA with99.3% (437/440) and 0.7% (3/440) carried mecA and mecC genes, respectively. In120 MRSA isolates, the MIC of vancomycin was >1.5microg/mL. In MRSA isolates withhigh vancomycin MIC (>1.5microg/mL), the most common SCCmec type was SCCmec III(38.3%), followed by SCCmec IVa (15.8%), SCCmec IIIa (13.3%,), SCCmec IVc (7.5%),SCCmec IVe (5.8%), SCCmec IVd (5.8%), SCCmec IVb (4.2%), SCCmec II (2.5%), SCCmecV (1.7%), SCCmec I (1.7%) and SCCmec XI (1.7%). MLVA revealed 60 genotypic groupsof MRSA isolates having a 92% similarity index. Conclusion: SCCmec III was themost common type in genetically related MRSA isolates showing vancomycin MICcreep. The presence of SCCmec XI may further add burden to infection controlmeasures.

AB  - Objective: Internet of Things (IoT) integrates several technologies where deviceslearn from the experience of each other thereby reducing human-intervened likely errors. Modern technologies like IoT and machine learning enable the conventionalto patient-specific approach transition in healthcare. In conventional approach, the biggest challenge faced by healthcare professionals is to predict a diseaseby observing the symptoms, monitoring the remote area patient, and also attendingto the patient all the time after being hospitalised. IoT provides real-timedata, makes decision-making smarter, and provides far superior analytics, and allthese to help improve the quality of healthcare. The main objective of the workwas to create an IoT-based automated system using machine learning models forsymptom-based COVID-19 prognosis. Methods: Comparative analysis of predictivemicrobiology of COVID-19 from case symptoms using various machine learningclassifiers like logistics regression, k-nearest neighbor, support vectormachine, random forest, decision trees, Naive Bayes, and gradient booster isreported here. For the sake of the validation and verification of the models,performance of each model based on the retrieved cloud-stored data was measuredfor accuracy. Results: From the accuracy plot, it was concluded that k-NN wasmore accurate (97.97%) followed by decision tree (97.79), support vector machine (97.42), logistics regression (96.50), random forest (90.66), gradient boostingclassifier (87.77), and Naive Bayes (73.50) in COVID-19 prognosis. Conclusion:The paper presents a health monitoring IoT framework having high clinicalsignificance in real-time and remote healthcare monitoring. The findings reportedhere and the lessons learnt shall enable the healthcare system worldwide tocounter not only this ongoing COVID but many other such global pandemics thehumanity may suffer from time to come.

TI  - An In Vitro Evaluation of the Antimicrobial Activity of Probiotics AgainstEndodontic Pathogens.
PG  - e26455
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26455 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Despite scientific evidence that even some microorganisms maybe useful, endodontic intervention has persisted to prioritize the removal of allmicroorganisms from the root canal system. Indeed, information regarding thesignificant role of probiotic microorganisms in endodontic treatment has beensparse. This study aimed to carry out an in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobialactivity of probiotics against endodontic pathogens. METHODS: The evaluation was carried out in three stages. In Stage 1, the agar cup well procedure was used to analyse the efficiency of probiotics microorganisms against Enterococcus faecalisbacteria and Candida albicans microorganisms in the planktonic stage. In Stage 2,a deferred antagonistic experiment was used to determine the activity ofprobiotic microorganisms against endodontic pathogens like E. faecalis and C.albicans in the planktonic phase. In Stage 3, biofilm phase evaluation of anintracanal probiotic microorganism carrier was done. The region of maximuminhibition was measured at the end of Stages 1 and 2. The antimicrobial activity was recognized when the dimension of the region of maximum inhibition was 10 mmor above. The colony-forming unit/millilitre was measured at the end of Stage 3. RESULTS: There was marked antimicrobial activity of probiotic microorganismsagainst the pathogenic microorganisms E. faecalis as well as C. albicans inStages 1 and 3, i.e., during the evaluation involving agar cup and evaluation at the biofilm stage. However, no antimicrobial activity of probiotic microorganismswas observed against pathogenic endodontic microorganisms in Stage 2, i.e.,during evaluation involving the use of the deferred antagonistic technique.CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that probiotic therapy is a promisingantibacterial treatment approach that should be further investigated. This study shows that probiotics can help effectively in endodontic treatment and that more in vitro as well as in vivo research is needed to fully appreciate the advantagesof bacteriotherapy in the field of endodontics.

TI  - Atypical Stroke-Like Presentation in a Critically-Ill Patient With Serratiamarcescens Bullous Cellulitis.
PG  - e26404
LID - 10.7759/cureus.26404 [doi]
AB  - Skin and soft-tissue infections are common in critically ill patients, especiallywith gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus or Staphylococcus species.However, it is imperative to consider gram-negative infections in atypicalpresentations of bullous cellulitis, where patients do not initially respond tocommon empiric therapy for skin infections. Serratia marcescens is agram-negative organism that manifests in nosocomial settings due to its affinity for moisture-rich environments. This bacteria is often difficult to treat due to extensive antibiotic resistance, and thus treatment is generally catered towards culture sensitivity. Rarely, this bacteria is an infective agent of infectiveendocarditis. We present a case of a 44-year-old gentleman who presented withstroke-like symptoms and was found to have bullous cellulitis with deep woundcultures growing S. marcescens. This case report highlights an atypical, severepresentation, and aims to provide a literature review of this rare manifestation of S. marcescens in skin and soft-tissue infections. We intend to improve rapiddiagnosis and proper treatment for future critically-ill patients with skin andsoft-tissue infections.

AB  - Alongside the currently used nasal swab testing, the COVID-19 pandemic situation would gain noticeable advantages from low-cost tests that are available atany-time, anywhere, at a large-scale, and with real time answers. A novelapproach for COVID-19 assessment is adopted here, discriminating negativesubjects versus positive or recovered subjects. The scope is to identifypotential discriminating features, highlight mid and short-term effects of COVID on the voice and compare two custom algorithms. A pool of 310 subjects took part in the study; recordings were collected in a low-noise, controlled settingemploying three different vocal tasks. Binary classifications followed, using twodifferent custom algorithms. The first was based on the coupling of boosting and bagging, with an AdaBoost classifier using Random Forest learners. A featureselection process was employed for the training, identifying a subset of featuresacting as clinically relevant biomarkers. The other approach was centred on twocustom CNN architectures applied to mel-Spectrograms, with a customknowledge-based data augmentation. Performances, evaluated on an independent testset, were comparable: Adaboost and CNN differentiated COVID-19 positive fromnegative with accuracies of 100% and 95% respectively, and recovered fromnegative individuals with accuracies of 86.1% and 75% respectively. This studyhighlights the possibility to identify COVID-19 positive subjects, foreseeing atool for on-site screening, while also considering recovered subjects and theeffects of COVID-19 on the voice. The two proposed novel architectures allow for the identification of biomarkers and demonstrate the ongoing relevance oftraditional ML versus deep learning in speech analysis.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented and unique falloutworldwide and creates colossal disruption in human survival. During the pandemic,social networking sites (SNS) played a significant role in disseminating newsrelated to the pandemic. Methods: This research is based on primary datacollected from 400 successful respondents via online Google Form. BivariatePearson's Chi-square and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis wereperformed to determine the impact of the explanatory variables on the studyvariables. Results: This study reveals that most respondents (n=360, 90%) use SNSto get up-to-date news, and 72.5% (n=290) read health-related information. Thehighest number of participants (n=386, 96.5%) were Facebook users. Multivariatebinary logistic regression reveals that "reading news on SNS" and "sharinginformation related to COVID-19 on social media" significantly influence thespread of awareness of COVID-19. "Unauthentic news sources" and "stop usingsocial media to stay away from panic" also have a substantial impact on thespread of panic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion: SNS has become aninevitable medium of information carrier nowadays. Social media users are foundsignificantly aware of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this study mightassist the concerned persons in taking the necessary steps to propagate authenticnews and regulate appropriate policies to prevent spreading misinformation.

AB  - The gut microbiome is intricately coupled with immune regulation and metabolism, but its role in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is not fully understood.Severe and fatal COVID-19 is characterized by poor anti-viral immunity andhypercoagulation, particularly in males. Here, we define multiple pathways bywhich the gut microbiome protects mammalian hosts from SARS-CoV-2 intranasalinfection, both locally and systemically, via production of short-chain fattyacids (SCFAs). SCFAs reduced viral burdens in the airways and intestines bydownregulating the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), and enhancing adaptive immunity via GPR41 and 43 in male animals. Wefurther identify a novel role for the gut microbiome in regulating systemiccoagulation response by limiting megakaryocyte proliferation and plateletturnover via the Sh2b3-Mpl axis. Taken together, our findings have unravelednovel functions of SCFAs and fiber-fermenting gut bacteria to dampen viral entry and hypercoagulation and promote adaptive antiviral immunity.

TI  - Seeking Standardized Definitions for HLA-incompatible Kidney Transplants: ASystematic Review.
LID - TP.0000000000004262 [pii]
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000004262 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is no standard definition for "HLA incompatible" transplants.For the first time, we systematically assessed how HLA incompatibility wasdefined in contemporary peer-reviewed publications and its prognostic implicationto transplant outcomes. METHODS: We combined 2 independent searches of MEDLINE,EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library from 2015 to 2019. Content-expert reviewersscreened for original research on outcomes of HLA-incompatible transplants(defined as allele or molecular mismatch and solid-phase or cell-based assays).We ascertained the completeness of reporting on a predefined set of variablesassessing HLA incompatibility, therapies, and outcomes. Given significantheterogeneity, we conducted narrative synthesis and assessed risk of bias instudies examining the association between death-censored graft failure and HLAincompatibility. RESULTS: Of 6656 screened articles, 163 evaluated transplantoutcomes by HLA incompatibility. Most articles reported on cytotoxic/flow T-cell crossmatches (n = 98). Molecular genotypes were reported for selected loci at theallele-group level. Sixteen articles reported on epitope compatibility.Pretransplant donor-specific HLA antibodies were often considered (n = 143); yet there was heterogeneity in sample handling, assay procedure, and incompletereporting on donor-specific HLA antibodies assignment. Induction (n = 129) andmaintenance immunosuppression (n = 140) were frequently mentioned but less sorejection treatment (n = 72) and desensitization (n = 70). Studies assessingdeath-censored graft failure risk by HLA incompatibility were vulnerable to bias in the participant, predictor, and analysis domains. CONCLUSIONS: Optimization oftransplant outcomes and personalized care depends on accurate HLA compatibilityassessment. Reporting on a standard set of variables will help assessgeneralizability of research, allow knowledge synthesis, and facilitateinternational collaboration in clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, different therapeutic lines have been tried in the initial stage of the disease of COVID-19, including remdesivir and molnupiravir. There isscarce evidence on the efficacy and safety of molnupiravir in kidney transplantrecipients (KTRs). METHODS: ingle-center prospective cohort study' all adult KTRsdiagnosed with COVID-19 and treated with molnupiravir or remdesivir from January to April 2022 were included. RESULTS: Nine KTRs with SARS-CoV-2 (Omicron variant)infection and mild symptoms received molnupiravir in an outpatient basis and werecompared with a cohort of similar patients treated with remdesivir (n = 7). Threepatients in the molnupiravir cohort were in the early posttransplant period andreceived a basiliximab (n = 2) or antithymocite globulin-based induction (n = 1).One of the patients had been treated with methylprednisolone bolus andantithymocite globulin for an episode of acute rejection in the previous months. They were all vaccinated with mRNA vaccines' and all but 1 had serologicalresponse. Only one of the patients experienced clinical worsening despitemolnupiravir treatment and developed pneumonia requiring hospital admission. Noneof the patients suffered adverse effects attributed to molnupiravir' and noadjustment of tacrolimus dose was needed. None of the patients treated withremdesivir progressed in COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that KTRs with SARS-CoV-2 infection under treatment with molnupiravir have a goodclinical evolution with a probable lower risk for hospitalization and no adverse effects. At the renal level, molnupiravir was well tolerated, with no evidence ofnephrotoxicity secondary to the drug nor interactions with the immunosuppressive therapy.

PG  - 166
LID - 10.1186/s13059-022-02722-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Individual and environmental health outcomes are frequently linked tochanges in the diversity of associated microbial communities. Thus, derivinghealth indicators based on microbiome diversity measures is essential. Whilemicrobiome data generated using high-throughput 16S rRNA marker gene surveys are appealing for this purpose, 16S surveys also generate a plethora of spuriousmicrobial taxa. RESULTS: When this artificial inflation in the observed number oftaxa is ignored, we find that changes in the abundance of detected taxa confound current methods for inferring differences in richness. Experimental evidence,theory-guided exploratory data analyses, and existing literature support theconclusion that most sub-genus discoveries are spurious artifacts of clustering16S sequencing reads. We proceed to model a 16S survey's systematic patterns ofsub-genus taxa generation as a function of genus abundance to derive a robustcontrol for false taxa accumulation. These controls unlock classical regressionapproaches for highly flexible differential richness inference at various levels of the surveyed microbial assemblage: from sample groups to specific taxacollections. The proposed methodology for differential richness inference isavailable through an R package, Prokounter. CONCLUSIONS: False speciesdiscoveries bias richness estimation and confound differential richnessinference. In the case of 16S microbiome surveys, supporting evidence indicatethat most sub-genus taxa are spurious. Based on this finding, a flexible methodis proposed and is shown to overcome the confounding problem noted with currentapproaches for differential richness inference.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Kenya introduced Rotarix((R)) (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals,Rixensart, Belgium) vaccination into its national immunization programmebeginning July 2014. The impact of this vaccination program on the localepidemiology of various known enteropathogens is not fully understood. METHODS:We used a custom TaqMan Array Card (TAC) to screen for 28 differententeropathogens in 718 stools from children aged less than 13 years admitted toKilifi County Hospital, coastal Kenya, following presentation with diarrhea in2013 (before vaccine introduction) and in 2016-2018 (after vaccine introduction).Pathogen positivity rate differences between pre- and post-Rotarix((R))vaccination introduction were examined using both univariate and multivariablelogistic regression models. RESULTS: In 665 specimens (92.6%), one or moreenteropathogen was detected, while in 323 specimens (48.6%) three or moreenteropathogens were detected. The top six detected enteropathogens were:enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAggEC; 42.1%), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC; 30.2%), enterovirus (26.9%), rotavirus group A (RVA; 24.8%),parechovirus (16.6%) and norovirus GI/GII (14.4%). Post-rotavirus vaccineintroduction, there was a significant increase in the proportion of samplestesting positive for EAggEC (35.7% vs. 45.3%, p = 0.014), cytomegalovirus (4.2%vs. 9.9%, p = 0.008), Vibrio cholerae (0.0% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.019), Strongyloidesspecies (0.8% vs. 3.6%, p = 0.048) and Dientamoeba fragilis (2.1% vs. 7.8%, p =0.004). Although not reaching statistical significance, the positivity rate ofadenovirus 40/41 (5.8% vs. 7.3%, p = 0.444), norovirus GI/GII (11.2% vs. 15.9%, p= 0.089), Shigella species (8.7% vs. 13.0%, p = 0.092) and Cryptosporidium spp.(11.6% vs. 14.7%, p = 0.261) appeared to increase post-vaccine introduction.Conversely, the positivity rate of sapovirus decreased significantly post-vaccineintroduction (7.8% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.030) while that of RVA appeared not to change (27.4% vs. 23.5%, p = 0.253). More enteropathogen coinfections were detected per child post-vaccine introduction compared to before (mean: 2.7 vs. 2.3; p =0.0025). CONCLUSIONS: In this rural Coastal Kenya setting, childhoodenteropathogen infection burden was high both pre- and post-rotavirus vaccinationintroduction. Children who had diarrheal admissions post-vaccination showed anincrease in coinfections and changes in specific enteropathogen positivity rates.This study highlights the utility of multipathogen detection platforms such asTAC in understanding etiology of childhood acute gastroenteritis inresource-limited regions.

TI  - Impact of rapid molecular testing on diagnosis, treatment and management ofcommunity-acquired pneumonia in Norway: a pragmatic randomised controlled trial(CAPNOR).
PG  - 622
LID - 10.1186/s13063-022-06467-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) causes a large burden of disease. Due to difficulties in obtaining representative respiratory samples andinsensitive standard microbiological methods, the microbiological aetiology ofCAP is difficult to ascertain. With a few exceptions, standard-of-carediagnostics are too slow to influence initial decisions on antimicrobial therapy.The management of CAP is therefore largely based on empirical treatmentguidelines. Empiric antimicrobial therapy is often initiated in the primary care setting, affecting diagnostic tests based on conventional bacterial culture inhospitalized patients. Implementing rapid molecular testing may improve both the proportion of positive tests and the time it takes to obtain test results. Bothmeasures are important for initiation of pathogen-targeted antibiotics, involvingrapid de-escalation or escalation of treatment, which may improve antimicrobialstewardship and potentially patient outcome. METHODS: Patients presenting to the emergency department of Haukeland University Hospital (HUH) in Bergen, Norway,will be screened for inclusion into a pragmatic randomised controlled trial(RCT). Eligible patients with a suspicion of CAP will be included and randomised to receive either standard-of-care methods (standard microbiological testing) or standard-of-care methods in addition to testing by the rapid and comprehensivereal-time multiplex PCR panel, the BioFire(R) FilmArray(R) Pneumonia Panel plus(FAP plus) (bioMerieux S.A., Marcy-l'Etoile, France). The results of the FAP pluswill be communicated directly to the treating staff within ~2 h of sampling.DISCUSSION: We will examine if rapid use of FAP plus panel in hospitalizedpatients with suspected CAP can improve both the time to and the proportion ofpatients receiving pathogen-directed treatment, thereby shortening the exposureto unnecessary antibiotics and the length of hospital admission, compared to the standard-of-care arm. The pragmatic design together with broad inclusion criteriaand a straightforward intervention could make our results generalizable to other similar centres.

TI  - Disseminated Mycobacterium chimaera infection in a patient with adult-onsetimmunodeficiency syndrome: case report.
PG  - 665
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07656-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with adult-onset immunodeficiency syndrome due toanti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies (AIGAs) are susceptible to disseminatedMycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections. M. chimaera, a newly identified MACspecies, is distinguished from the others due to the reduced virulence. Previous cases of disseminated M. chimaera infection have been linked to cardiothoracicsurgery. Reports of disseminated M. chimaera in patients without a history ofcardiothoracic surgery are rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 57-year-old Asian man,previously healthy, presented with fever, dry cough, exertional dyspnea, anddecreased appetite. The delayed resolution of pneumonia despite antibiotictreatment prompted further imaging studies and biopsies from the lung and lymphnode. The fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography(FDG-PET/CT) demonstrated intense uptake in lung consolidations and diffuselymphadenopathy. Cultures of the specimens obtained from sputum, blood, stool,lung tissue, and lymph node grew M. chimaera. Further immunological evaluationdisclosed the presence of neutralizing AIGAs, which possibly led to acquiredimmunodeficiency and disseminated M. chimaera infection. CONCLUSIONS: We hereinpresent the first case of adult-onset immunodeficiency due to AIGAs complicatedwith disseminated M. chimaera infection. Further immunological evaluation,including AIGAs, may be warranted in otherwise healthy patients who present with disseminated mycobacterial infection.

TI  - Species-specific identification of Pseudomonas based on 16S-23S rRNA geneinternal transcribed spacer (ITS) and its combined application withnext-generation sequencing.
PG  - 188
LID - 10.1186/s12866-022-02607-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas species are widely distributed in the human body,animals, plants, soil, fresh water, seawater, etc. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the main pathogens involved in nosocomial infections. It can causeendocarditis, empyema, meningitis, septicaemia and even death. However, thePseudomonas classification system is currently inadequate and not wellestablished. RESULTS: In this study, the whole genomes of 103 Pseudomonas strainsbelonging to 62 species available in GenBank were collected and the specificityof the 16S-23S ribosomal RNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence wasanalysed. Secondary structures of ITS transcripts determining where the diversitybases were located were predicted. The alignment results using BLAST indicatedthat the ITS sequence is specific for most species in the genus. The remainingspecies were identified by additional frequency analyses based on BLAST results. A double-blind experiment where 200 ITS sequences were randomly selectedindicated that this method could identify Pseudomonas species with 100%sensitivity and specificity. In addition, we applied a universal primer toamplify the Pseudomonas ITS of DNA extracts from fish samples withnext-generation sequencing. The ITS analysis results were utilized tospecies-specifically identify the proportion of Pseudomonas species in thesamples. CONCLUSIONS: The present study developed a species-specific methodidentification and classification of Pseudomonas based on ITS sequences combined NGS. The method showed its potential application in other genera.

TI  - The difference in pathogenic bacteria between chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with and without Sjogren's syndrome: a retrospective case-control study.
PG  - 666
LID - 10.1186/s12879-022-07652-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects the quality of life of manypeople worldwide and can cause comorbidities. Our previous research proved thatSjogren's syndrome (SS) is a predisposing factor for CRS, with a 2.5-foldassociated risk. Antibiotics are important in CRS treatment; however, there is a paucity of research on the pathogenic bacteria of SS-CRS in the past. Weconducted this study to investigate the pathogenic difference of SS-CRS andnon-SS-CRS and aimed to give clinicians references when selecting antibiotics to treat SS-CRS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 14,678 patients hospitalized for CRS operation from 2004 to 2018 were identified from the Chang Gung ResearchDatabase. These CRS cases were classified as either SS-CRS or non-SS-CRS. Weanalyzed their bacterial distribution by studying the results of the pus culturesperformed alongside surgery. RESULTS: The top three facultative anaerobic oraerobic isolated bacteria in the SS-CRS group were coagulase-negativeStaphylococcus (CoNS: 34.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.6%),methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA: 20%), and Staphylococcusepidermidis (20%). In the non-SS-CRS group, S. epidermidis (29.3%), CoNS (25.7%),and MSSA (14.2%) were identified. The top three anaerobic bacterial genera wereCutibacterium (54.3%), Peptostreptococcus (11.4%), and Fusobacterium (11.4%) inthe SS-CRS group and Cutibacterium (53.8%), Peptostreptococcus (25%), andPrevotella (12.9%) in the non-SS-CRS group. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa is a majorpathogen in SS-CRS patients. In addition, physicians should be aware of potentialFusobacterium and antibiotic-resistant bacterial infection in patients withSS-CRS.

TI  - Metagenomic Sequencing of the Gallbladder Microbiome: Bacterial Diversity DoesNot Vary by Surgical Pathology.
LID - 10.1007/s11605-022-05418-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alterations in the microbiome contribute to the pathogenesis ofmany gastrointestinal diseases. However, the composition of the microbiome ingallbladder disease is not well described. METHODS: We aimed to characterize the biliary microbiome in cholecystectomy patients. Bile and biliary stones werecollected at cholecystectomy for a variety of surgical indications between 2017and 2019. DNA was extracted and metagenomic sequencing was performed withsubsequent taxonomic classification using Kraken2. The fraction of bacterial tototal DNA reads, relative abundance of bacterial species, and overall speciesdiversity were compared between pathologies and demographics. RESULTS: A total of74 samples were obtained from 49 patients: 46 bile and 28 stones, with matchedpairs from 25 patients. The mean age was 48 years, 76% were female, 29% wereHispanic, and 29% of patients had acute cholecystitis. The most abundant species were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcuspasteurianus. The bacterial fraction in bile and stone samples was higher inacute cholecystitis compared to other non-infectious pathologies (p < 0.05).Neither the diversity nor differential prevalence of specific bacterial speciesvaried significantly between infectious and other non-infectious gallbladderpathologies. Multivariate analysis of the non-infectious group revealed thatpatients over 40 years of age had increased bacterial fractions (p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Metagenomic sequencing permits characterization of the gallbladdermicrobiome in cholecystectomy patients. Although a higher prevalence of bacteria was seen in acute cholecystitis, species and diversity were similar regardless ofsurgical indication. Additional study is required to determine how the microbiomecan contribute to the development of symptomatic gallbladder disease.

TI  - Acute Headache Management for Patients with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: AnInternational Survey of Health Care Providers.
LID - 10.1007/s12028-022-01571-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe headaches are common after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Guidelinesrecommend treatment with acetaminophen and opioids, but patient data show thatheadaches often persist despite multimodal treatment approaches. Considering anoverall slim body of data for a common complaint affecting patients with SAHduring their intensive care stay, we set out to assess practice patterns inheadache management among clinicians who treat patients with SAH. METHODS: Weconducted an international cross-sectional study through a 37-question Web-based survey distributed to members of five professional societies relevant tointensive and neurocritical care from November 2021 to January 2022. Responseswere characterized through descriptive analyses. Fisher's exact test was used to test associations. RESULTS: Of 516 respondents, 329 of 497 (66%) were from North America and 121 of 497 (24%) from Europe. Of 435 respondents, 379 (87%) reported headache as a major management concern for patients with SAH. Intensive careteams were primarily responsible for analgesia during hospitalization (249 of435, 57%), whereas responsibility shifted to neurosurgery at discharge (233 of501, 47%). Most used medications were acetaminophen (90%), opioids (66%),corticosteroids (28%), and antiseizure medications (28%). Opioids or medicationcombinations including opioids were most frequently perceived as most effectiveby 169 of 433 respondents (39%, predominantly intensivists), followed bycorticosteroids or combinations with corticosteroids (96 of 433, 22%,predominantly neurologists). Of medications prescribed at discharge,acetaminophen was most common (303 of 381, 80%), followed by opioids (175 of 381,46%) and antiseizure medications (173 of 381, 45%). Opioids duringhospitalization were significantly more prescribed by intensivists, by providers managing higher numbers of patients with SAH, and in Europe. At discharge,opioids were more frequently prescribed in North America. Of 435 respondents, 299(69%) indicated no change in prescription practice of opioids with the opioidcrisis. Additional differences in prescription patterns between continents andproviders and while inpatient versus at discharge were found. CONCLUSIONS:Post-SAH headache in the intensive care setting is a major clinical concern.Analgesia heavily relies on opioids both in use and in perception of efficacy,with no reported change in prescription patterns for opioids for most providersdespite the significant drawbacks of opioids. Responsibility for analgesia shiftsbetween hospitalization and discharge. International and provider-relateddifferences are evident. Novel treatment strategies and alignment of prescriptionbetween providers are urgently needed.

TI  - Improved Aerosolization Stability of Inhalable Tobramycin Powder Formulation byCo-Spray Drying with Colistin.
LID - 10.1007/s11095-022-03344-5 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Tobramycin shows synergistic antibacterial activity with colistin andcan reduce the toxic effects of colistin. The purpose of this study is to preparepulmonary powder formulations containing both colistin and tobramycin and toassess their in vitro aerosol performance and storage stability. METHODS: The drypowder formulations were manufactured using a lab-scale spray dryer. In vitroaerosol performance was measured using a Next Generation Impactor. The storagestability of the dry powder formulations was measured at 22 degrees C and tworelative humidity levels - 20 and 55%. Colistin composition on the particlesurface was measured using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. RESULTS: Twocombination formulations, with 1:1 and 1:5 molar ratios of colistin andtobramycin, showed fine particle fractions (FPF) of 85%, which was significantly higher than that of the spray dried tobramycin (45%). FPF of the tobramycinformulation increased significantly when stored for four weeks at both 20% and55% RH. In contrast, FPF values of both combination formulations and spray dried colistin remained stable at both humidity levels. Particle surface of eachcombination was significantly enriched in colistin molecules; 1:5 combinationshowed 77% by wt. colistin. CONCLUSIONS: The superior aerosol performance andaerosolization stability of 1:1 and 1:5 combination formulations of colistin and tobramycin could be attributed to enrichment of colistin on the co-spray driedparticle surface. The observed powder properties may be the result of asurfactant-like assembly of these colistin molecules during spray drying, thusforming a hydrophobic particle surface.

TI  - Effects of Rubus fruticosus and Juniperus oxycedrus derivatives on culturability and viability of Listeria monocytogenes.
PG  - 13158
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17408-4 [doi]
AB  - The consumers' demand for safe foods without chemical additives increased theresearch for green solutions, based on natural antimicrobials. Plants can be animportant source of bioactive compounds able to prevent the development offoodborne pathogens and spoilage microflora. This paper aimed to characterizephenolic extracts (PEs) and essential oils (EOs) obtained from MediterraneanRubus fruticosus leaves and Juniperus oxycedrus needles and to evaluate theirantimicrobial effects against Listeria monocytogenes Scott A. The growth dynamicswith sub-lethal concentrations of plant derivatives were modeled and flowcytometry was used to better evidence the effect on cell viability andculturability. The results showed that these plant derivatives affected thegrowth of L. monocytogenes, increasing lag phase (about 40 h in the presence ofPEs vs. 8 h in the control) and decreasing the final cell load of at least 1 log cycle with respect to the control. R. fruticosus EO was the most effective,determining an initial decrease of cell counts of about 6 log cycles, followed bya restart of growth after 10 h, with rate similar to the control (0.08 with R.fruticosus EO vs. 0.09 ((log CFU/ml)/h in the control) but significantly lowerfinal cell load (7.33 vs. 8.92 log CFU/ml). According to flow cytometry, only R. fruticosus EO induced a relevant increase of dead cells, while the other plantderivatives determined different extent of sub-lethal cell injury. Thediscrepancy observed in some cases between viability and culturability couldindicate the presence of cells not able to grow in culture media, whose fateneeds to be further investigated to assess their potential recovery, thusbringing to an overestimation of the antimicrobial effect of these substances.This research contributed to increase the knowledge of these underused rawmaterials such as blackberry leaves and juniper needles that can be exploited in food and other industries.

TI  - Differences in methane and nitrous oxide emissions and soil bacteria communities between straw return methods in central China.
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-21883-7 [doi]
AB  - It is well recognized that straw return (SR) can improve soil fertility and soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. Increasing planting density and reducing nitrogenfertilizer application is considered an effective cultivation technique forjaponica rice in central and northern China. However, few are known about themechanisms of differences between wheat SR with rice planting densification and Nreduction (SRD) and wheat SR on greenhouse gas emissions and soil bacteriacommunities in central China. A 2-year experiment was conducted to evaluate theeffects of SR and SRD compared with straw removal (NS) on methane (CH4) andnitrous oxide (N2O) emission, rice yield, and soil properties in Henan Province, China, in 2019 and 2020. We found that SRD increased SOC, available phosphorous(AP), and available potassium (AK) compared to SR and NS in 2019 and 2020. Themean CH4 flux was positively correlated with SOC, and the cumulative CH4emissions of SR and SRD plots were significantly higher than those of NS plots.No significant difference in cumulative CH4 emissions was detected between the SRand SRD treatments. N2O emissions were significantly lower under SRD than SR. SRDsignificantly affected soil bacteria diversity and composition at a depth of 0-15cm. The relative abundance of Bacteroidota in SRD soil was 1.37- and 3.73-foldhigher than that in NS and SR soils, respectively. The relative abundance ofnitrate reduction-related operational taxonomic units enriched under SRD wassignificantly lower than that under SR, indicating that lower nitrate reductionof N2O production was induced by soil bacteria under SRD. N partial factorproductivity was 21.4% and 28.5% higher under SRD than SR in 2019 and 2020,respectively. Our results suggest that SRD decreased soil bacteria N2O emissions;increased SOC, AP, and AK; and improved N fertilizer use efficiency, therebyimproving rice yield in central China.

TI  - Determination of Elemental Contents and Microbiological and Chemical Propertiesof Cokelek Cheeses Consumed in Turkey.
LID - 10.1007/s12011-022-03374-5 [doi]
AB  - The Cokelek samples what 30 different were collected from randomly local bazaars to investigate heavy metal contaminant and mineral levels and somephysicochemical and microbiological properties of samples. While the Pb wasidentified in 6 of the 30 samples, the As was only found in 4 of the samples. Themean major and trace element contents of Cokelek samples were ordered as Na > P >Ca > K > Mg and Al > Zn > Ni > Cu, respectively. The physicochemical propertiesindicated a high deviation among samples. The mean total solids, ash, salt, fat, protein waters soluble nitrogen contents, and sample ripening index were 29.83%, 1.88%, 0.68%, 4.31%, 19.84%, 0.33%, and 1.79%, respectively. The mean totalaerobic mesophilic bacteria (TAMB) count of Cokelek samples was found as 8.26 logCFU g(-1). The coliform bacteria and yeast-mold counts were detected in 11 and 27of 30 samples, respectively. The mean coliform and yeast-mold counts were 1.82log CFU g(-1) and 7.11 log CFU g(-1), respectively. Traditional cheeses are notmentioned in legal laws such as the Turkish Food Codex. So, there is no legallimit and standard production processes. This situation is a problem in terms of traditional cheese quality. For this reason, traditional cheese should performfurther studied, and determine the legal limits.

TI  - Treatment duration for central line-associated infection caused by Enterococcusspp.: a retrospective evaluation of a multicenter cohort.
LID - 10.1007/s10096-022-04481-w [doi]
AB  - Objective of this study was to assess the appropriate treatment duration forenterococcal central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). Thisobservational, retrospective, multicenter study conducted between 2011 and 2019enrolled all hospitalized patients with monomicrobial enterococcal CLABSI. Those with infective endocarditis and non-survivors at least 7 days from index bloodculture (BC) were excluded. Primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. We enrolled113 patients, of whom 59% were male, median age was 64 (SD +/- 15) and medianCharlson's index score 5 (IQR 3-8). Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcusfaecium were found in 51% and 44% of cases, respectively. Median treatmentduration was 11 days (IQR 6-17), and 32% of patients (n = 36) received </= 7days. Characteristics of patients receiving more or less than 7 days of treatmentwere similar. Central line was removed in 82% (n = 93) of cases within a medianof 3 days (1-8). At both uni- and multivariate analysis, duration of antibiotictreatment > 7 days was not associated with 30-day mortality [HR 0.41 (95% CI,0.13-1.24), p = 0.12] even after adjustment with propensity score [HR 0.47 (95%CI 0.17-1.26), p = 0.13]. A 7-day treatment course appears to be safe innon-complicated enterococcal CLABSIs.

LID - 10.1038/s41433-022-02169-1 [doi]
AB  - The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated nuclease (Cas) system is an adaptive immune defencesystem that has gradually evolved in bacteria and archaea to combat invadingviruses and exogenous DNA. Advances in technology have enabled researchers toenhance their understanding of the immune process in vivo and its potential foruse in genome editing. Thus far, applications of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editingtechnology in ophthalmology have included gene therapy for corneal dystrophy,glaucoma, congenital cataract, Leber's congenital amaurosis, retinitispigmentosa, Usher syndrome, fundus neovascular disease, proliferativevitreoretinopathy, retinoblastoma and other eye diseases. Additionally, thecombination of CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology with adeno-associated virus vector and inducible pluripotent stem cells provides further therapeutic avenues for the treatment of eye diseases. Nonetheless, many challenges remain in thedevelopment of clinically feasible retinal genome editing therapy. This reviewdiscusses the development, as well as mechanism of CRISPR/Cas9 and itsapplications and challenges in gene therapy for eye diseases.

TI  - Novel secretion modification region (SMR) peptide exhibits anti-metastaticproperties in human breast cancer cells.

AB  - Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in womenworldwide, with nearly 90% attributed to metastatic progression. Exosomescontaining epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 'programs' transmitpro-metastatic phenotypes. Our group discovered and developed a novel anti-cancerSMR peptide that antagonizes breast cancer cell exosome release resulting in cellcycle arrest and tumor growth suppression. This study aims to evaluate theanti-metastatic capabilities of the SMR peptide, focusing on exosomes and EMT.Breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 were treated with the SMRwtpeptide, and the following assays were performed: cell wound-healing, migration, invasion. The SMRwt peptide consists of the following amino acid sequenceVGFPVAAVGFPVDYKDDDDK and contains the SMR domain ((66)VGFPV(70)) of the HIV-1 Nefprotein. Western blot analysis detected epithelial and mesenchymal markers toevaluate EMT progression. Extracellular vesicle type and quantity were assessedthrough NanoSight analysis. Mortalin and Vimentin knockdown was achieved through antibody targeting and miRNAs. Data gathered demonstrated that the SMR peptideinteracts with Mortalin and Vimentin to inhibit pro-EMT exosome release andinduce EMT tumor suppressor protein expression. Specifically, SMRwt treatmentreduced mesenchymal markers Mortalin and Vimentin expression, while theepithelial marker E-cadherin expression was increased in breast cancer cells and breast cancer-derived exosomes. The SMR peptide specificity was identified as no effect was observed for MCF-10A exosome release or function. Direct Mortalinknockdown paralleled the results of SMR peptide treatment with an effectiveblockade of breast cancer cell migration. Conversely, the invasion assay differedbetween breast cancer cell lines with invasion blocked for in MCF-7 but not inMDA-MB-231. These results reinforce the therapeutic value of targeting breastcancer exosome release and reinforce Mortalin and Vimentin as critical regulatorsand therapeutic targets in breast cancer cell progression, EMT, and metastaticpotential. A greater understanding of the SMR peptide mechanism of action willbenefit the therapeutic design of anti-metastatic agents.

AB  - Functional fabrics with antibacterial performance are more welcome nowadays.However, the fabrication of functional fabrics with durable, steady performancevia a cost-effective way remains a challenge. Polypropylene (denoted as PP)nonwoven fabric was modified by polyvinyl alcohol (denoted as PVA), followed bythe in-situ deposition of silver nanoparticles (denoted as Ag NPs) to affordPVA-modified and Ag NPs-loaded PP (denoted as Ag/PVA/PP) fabric. Theencapsulation of PP fiber by PVA coating contributes to greatly enhancing theadhesion of the loaded Ag NPs to the PP fiber, and the Ag/PVA/PP nonwoven fabricsexhibit significantly improved mechanical properties as well as excellentantibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (coded as E. coli). Typically,the Ag/PVA/PP nonwoven fabric obtained at a silver ammonia concentration of 30 mMhas the best mechanical properties and the antibacterial rate reaches 99.99%against E. coli. The fabric retains excellent antibacterial activity even afterwashing for 40 cycles, showing prospects in reuse. Moreover, the Ag/PVA/PPnonwoven fabric could find promising application in industry, thanks to itsdesired air-permeability and moisture-permeability. In addition, we developed aroll-to-roll production process and conducted preliminary exploration to verifythe feasibility of this method.

AB  - Self-cycling fermentation (SCF), a cyclic process in which cells, on average,divide once per cycle, has been shown to lead to whole-culture synchronizationand improvements in productivity during bioconversion. Previous studies haveshown that the completion of synchronized cell replication sometimes occurssimultaneously with depletion of the limiting nutrient. However, cases in whichthe end of cell doubling occurred before limiting nutrient exhaustion were alsoobserved. In order to better understand the impact of these patterns onbioprocessing, we investigated the growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae andEscherichia coli in long- and short-cycle SCF strategies. Three characteristicevents were identified during SCF cycles: (1) an optimum in control parameters,(2) the time of completion of synchronized cell division, and (3) the depletionor plateau of the limiting nutrient. Results from this study and literature ledto the identification of three potential trends in SCF cycles: (A) co-occurrence of the three key events, (B) cell replication ending prior to the co-occurrenceof the other two events, and (C) depletion or plateau of the limiting nutrientoccurring later than the co-occurrence of the other two events. Based on theseobservations, microbial physiological differences were analyzed and a noveldefinition for SCF is proposed.

Although vertical transmission of seedmicrobes has been reported from diverse plants, ecological mechanisms anddynamics of microbial communities from parent to progeny remain scarce. Here wereveal the veiled ecological mechanism governing transmission of bacterial andfungal communities in rice across two consecutive seasons. We identify 29bacterial and 34 fungal members transmitted across generations. Abundance-basedregression models allow to classify colonization types of the microbes. We findthat they are late colonizers dominating each community at the ripening stage.Ecological models further show that the observed temporal colonization patternsare affected by niche change and neutrality. Source-sink modeling reveals thatparental seeds and stem endosphere are major origins of progeny seed microbialcommunities. This study gives empirical evidence for ecological mechanism anddynamics of bacterial and fungal communities as an ecological continuum duringseed-to-seed transmission.

AB  - The interactions of microalgae and their associated microbiomes have come to the fore of applied phycological research in recent years. However, the functionalmechanisms of microalgal interactions remain largely unknown. Here, we examinefunctional protein patterns of the microalgae Scenedesmus vacuolatus and itsassociated bacterial community during algal infection by the endoparasiteAmoeboaphelidium protococcarum. We performed metaproteomics analyses ofnon-infected (NI) and aphelid-infected (AI) S. vacuolatus cultures to investigateunderlying functional and physiological changes under infectious conditions. Weobserved an increase in bacterial protein abundance as well as a severe shift of bacterial functional patterns throughout aphelid-infection in comparison to NItreatment. Most of the bacterial proteins (about 55%) upregulated in AI werelinked to metabolism and transport of amino acids, lipids, coenzymes, nucleotidesand carbohydrates and to energy production. Several proteins associated withpathogenic bacterial-plant interactions showed higher protein abundance levels inAI treatment. These functional shifts indicate that associated bacteria involved in commensalistic or mutualistic interactions in NI switch to opportunisticlifestyles and facilitate pathogenic or saprotrophic traits in AI treatment. Insummary, the native bacterial microbiome adapted its metabolism to algal host dieoff and is able to metabolize nutrients from injured cells or decompose deadcellular material.

TI  - Midguts of Culex pipiens L. (Diptera: Culicidae) as a potential source of rawmilk contamination with pathogens.
PG  - 13183
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16992-9 [doi]
AB  - Despite their importance, only few studies focused on the mosquitoes bornemicrobial diseases, especially bacterial and fungal diseases, their vectorialcapacity toward microorganisms, and their important role in raw milkcontamination with pathogens in some unsanitary dairy farms. In Egypt, whereCulex pipiens is the historical main vector of lymphatic filariasis, only fewstudies discussed the isolation of pathogens from the midguts of different stagesof C. pipiens. This study aims to isolate and identify the pathogenic symbioticmicroorganisms inside the midgut of adult female C. pipiens as well asinvestigate its ability to transmit their midgut pathogens to raw milk. A totalof 750 field strain C. pipiens larvae of the second and third larval instars werecollected from ponds water around the livestock farms in Mariotteya, Giza, Egypt,for microbial pathogen isolation and identification. All collected larval instarswere transported to the laboratory at the Research and Training Center on Vectorsof Diseases (RTC), Ain Shams University, where they were maintained for furtherstudies. Six groups of C. pipiens were tested for the incidence of variouspathogenic microorganisms in their midguts and their possibility to contaminatecommercial sterilized milk. Traditional PCR assays and sequencing method detectedand identified 16srRNA genes of the predominant hemolytic isolates from milk and midguts of female C. pipiens. The phylogenetic analyses of the obtained isolates were performed based on NCBI data. Three strains of Bacillus anthracis strainCPMESA 2021, Staphylococcus warneri strain CPSAME 2021, and Bacillus cereusstrain CPSEMA 2021, which represent most food pathogens, were found in themidguts of C. pipiens and were submitted to the GenBank database with theaccession numbers OK585071, OK576651, and OK585052, respectively. The isolationof these strains from mosquitoes raises contemporary issues concerning milksafety, such as bacterial isolates, the degree of the vectorial capacity ofmosquitoes, milk production and processing conditions, and human pathogenicity.Such serious issues need further investigation.

PG  - 13196
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-17237-5 [doi]
AB  - HIV-infected individuals could be at a greater risk for developing lung cancerthan the general population due to the higher prevalence in the former of humanpapillomavirus (HPV) in the oral cavity and higher smoking rates. Our aim was to assess HPV prevalence and E6 viral oncogene transcription in lung cancer samples from HIV-infected individuals. This was a single-center, retrospective study of acohort of HIV-1-infected patients diagnosed with and treated for lung cancer.Pathological lung samples archived as smears or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks were subjected to HPV genotyping, detection of human p16 protein andassessment for HPV E6 mRNA expression. Lung cancer samples from 41 patients were studied, including squamous cell carcinoma (32%), adenocarcinoma (34%), non-smallcell cancer (27%), and small cell cancer (7%). HPV DNA was detected in 23 out of 41 (56%, 95% CI 41-70%) of samples and high-risk (HR)-HPV types were detected in 16 out of 41 (39%, 95% CI 26-54%), HPV-16 being the most prevalent [13/16 (81.3%,95% CI 57.0-93%]. In samples with sufficient material left: expression of p16 wasdetected in 3 out of 10 (30%) of HR-HPV DNA-positive tumors and in 3 out of 7(43%) of the negative ones; and E6 mRNA was detected in 2 out of 10 (20%) ofHPV-16-positive samples (squamous lung cancers). These two patients had abackground of a previous HPV-related neoplasia and smoking. HR-HPV DNA detection was prevalent in lung cancers in HIV-infected patients. However, viral oncogeneexpression was limited to patients with previous HPV-related cancers.

PG  - 13199
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-16046-0 [doi]
AB  - Juniperus phoenicea is a medicinal conifer tree species distributed mainly in theMediterranean region, and it is IUCN Red Listed species, locally threatened dueto arid conditions and seed over-collection for medicinal purposes, particularly in the East-Mediterranean region. Several studies have addressed the potentialdistribution of J. phoenicea using bioclimatic and topographic variables at alocal or global scale, but little is known about the role of soil and humaninfluences as potential drivers. Therefore, our objectives were to determine the most influential predictor factors and their relative importance that might belimiting the regeneration of J. phoenicea, in addition, identifying the mostsuitable areas which could be assumed as priority conservation areas. We usedensemble models for species distribution modelling. Our findings revealed thataridity, temperature seasonality, and clay content are the most important factorslimiting the potential distribution of J. phoenicea. Potentially suitable areasof the output maps, in which J. phoenicea populations degraded, could be assumed as decision-support tool reforestation planning. Other suitable areas, wherethere was no previous tree cover are a promising tool for afforestation andconservation planning. Finally, conservation actions are needed for naturalhabitats, particularly in the arid and semi-arid regions, which are highlythreatened by global warming.

PG  - 4466
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-32254-8 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern have continuously evolved and may erode vaccineinduced immunity. In this observational cohort study, we determine the risk ofbreakthrough infection in a fully vaccinated cohort. SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike IgGlevels were measured before first SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and at day 21-28, 90 and180, as well as after booster vaccination. Breakthrough infections were captured through the Danish National Microbiology database. incidence rate ratio (IRR) forbreakthrough infection at time-updated anti-spike IgG levels was determined usingPoisson regression. Among 6076 participants, 127 and 364 breakthrough infections due to Delta and Omicron variants were observed. IRR was 0.29 (95% CI 0.15-0.56) for breakthrough infection with the Delta variant, comparing the highest andlowest quintiles of anti-spike IgG. For Omicron, no significant differences inIRR were observed. These results suggest that quantitative level of anti-spikeIgG have limited impact on the risk of breakthrough infection with Omicron.

AB  - Invariant natural killer T cell (iNKT) subsets are differentially distributed in various immune organs. However, it remains unclear whether iNKT cells exhibitphenotypical and functional differences in different peripheral organs and howthymic iNKT cells emigrate to peripheral organs. Here, we used single-cellRNA-seq to map iNKT cells from peripheral organs. iNKT1 cells from liver, spleen,and lymph node appear to have distinct phenotypic profiles and functionalcapabilities. However, iNKT17 transcriptomes were comparable across peripheralorgans. In addition, by integrating data with a thymic iNKT cell study, weuncovered a transient population of recent thymic emigrants, a cluster ofperipheral iNKT cells with high expression of transcription factor Kruppel-likefactor 2 (Klf2). Deletion of Klf2 led to a severe impairment of iNKTdifferentiation and migration. Our study revealed that iNKT subsets are uniquely distributed in peripheral organs with some inter-local tissue variation,especially for iNKT1 cell, and identified Klf2 as a rheostat for iNKT cellmigration and differentiation.

AB  - Members of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex frequently colonize the gut and colonization is associated with subsequent infection. To identify genesassociated with progression from colonization to infection, we undertook acase-control comparative genomics study. Concordant cases (N = 85), wherecolonizing and invasive isolates were identical strain types, were matched toasymptomatically colonizing controls (N = 160). Thirty-seven genes are associatedwith infection, 27 of which remain significant following adjustment for patientvariables and bacterial phylogeny. Infection-associated genes are not previously characterized virulence factors, but instead a diverse group of stressresistance, regulatory and antibiotic resistance genes, despite carefuladjustment for antibiotic exposure. Many genes are plasmid borne, and for some,the relationship with infection is mediated by gut dominance. Five genes werevalidated in a geographically-independent cohort of colonized patients. Thisstudy identifies several genes reproducibly associated with progression toinfection in patients colonized by diverse Klebsiella.

AB  - AIMS: To verify the prevalence of Potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPB) and theirantimicrobial resistance profile in tracheal aspirates of children withtracheostomy and compare it to clinical data. METHODS: A cross-sectional studywas conducted in patients aged 0-18 years who all underwent tracheostomy cannula change (TCC) performed by the Otolaryngology Unit at Hospital de Clinicas dePorto Alegre, Brazil, between October, 2017 and December, 2018. Patients weresubmitted, at the time of TCC, to a tracheal aspirate through the tracheostomyand secretion was sent to microbiological analysis and antimicrobialsusceptibility testing. Clinical data were evaluated through available patients' electronic medical records. RESULTS: Forty-four patients had their tracheostomyaspirate cultured and all but one presented PPB growth (97.7%). Median age was 3 years-old. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most prevalent bacteria (56.9%) and it was resistant to gentamycin, amikacin and cefepime in 36%, 28% and 12% of theculture tests, respectively. P. aeruginosa resistance to gentamycin and tocefepime suggested an association with the number of antibiotic classes used inthe 12 months before enrollment (both p=0.04) and with 2 or more hospitaladmissions in the same period (p=0.03 and p=0.02, respectively). Staphylococcusaureus was isolated in 9.1% and there was no MRSA. CONCLUSION: It was found a97.7% prevalence of PPB in the cultured aspirates; the most prevalent bacteriumwas P. aeruginosa and there was no MRSA identification. Data suggest anassociation between P. aeruginosa antimicrobial resistance with previous use ofantibiotic therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Strongyloides stercoralis is an intestinal helminth ubiquitous intropical and subtropical regions worldwide. It persists in the human host for alifetime as a result of autoinfection and if undetected and untreated, can leadto increased morbidity and high mortality in immunocompromised individuals suchas the transplant population. Transplant patients, including solid-organ andhaematopoietic stem cell transplants (SOT and HSCT, respectively), are at a high risk of hyperinfection and disseminated strongyloidiasis. Unfortunately screeningis often not systematically performed. Prevalence estimates of Strongyloides inthis high-risk population is not well studied. Through this systematic review, weaim to summarise the descriptive evidence on Strongyloides prevalence in SOT and HSCT patients, including diagnostic and screening practices alongside the casesof hyperinfection, disseminated strongyloidiasis and the mortality rate in thispopulation. METHODS AND ANALYSES: Through the use of various online librarydatabases, we will conduct a systematic review including relevant literature onthe prevalence of Strongyloides in SOT and HSCT patients as well as studiesassessing hyperinfection and disseminated strongyloidiasis in this patientpopulation. The Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome and Study Designstrategy and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews andMeta-Analyses guidelines will be used to determine a final subset of studies for analysis. Quality assessment for case series and case reports will be determined by a modified quality assessment tool developed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NIH), and the CARE guidelines, respectively. We will provide anarrative synthesis of the findings pertaining to the primary and secondaryoutcomes of interest (prevalence of Strongyloides and mortality rate intransplant population, respectively) alongside the associated 95% CI. Estimatesfrom individual studies will be pooled using a random effects model. ETHICS ANDDISSEMINATION: This systematic review does not require formal ethical approvalsince no primary data will be collected. Findings will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed publication and relevant conferences. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER:CRD42021269305.

TI  - Global prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria in adults with non-cysticfibrosis bronchiectasis 2006-2021: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e055672
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-055672 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To accurately estimate the global prevalence of non-tuberculousmycobacteria (NTM) in adults with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis andto determine the proportion of NTM species and subspecies in clinical patientsfrom 2006 to 2021. DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis using thePreferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines.DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Web of Science were searched for articles published between 2006 and 2021. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: We included all the prospective or retrospective studies withoutlanguage restrictions and all patients were adults (>/=18 years of age) withnon-CF bronchiectasis. The studies estimated the effect size of the prevalence ofNTM with a sample size >/=40, and patients were registered in and after 2006.DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers screened the titles, abstracts andfull texts independently. Relevant information was extracted and curated intotables. Risk of bias was evaluated following the Cochrane Collaboration's tool.Meta-analysis was performed with software R Statistics V.3.6.3 using randomeffect model with 95% CI. I(2) index and Q statistics were calculated to assessthe heterogeneity, and mixed-effects meta-regression analyses were performed toidentify the sources of heterogeneity. The proportions of NTM subspecies wereexamined using Shapiro-Wilk normality test in R. RESULTS: Of all the 2014 studiesyielded, 24 met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 14 were identified to berandomised controlled studies and included for an accurate estimation. The globalprevalence of NTM in adults with non-CF bronchiectasis from 2006 to 2021 wasestimated to be approximately 10%, with great variations primarily due togeographical location. Mycobacterium avium complex was the most commonsubspecies, followed by Mycobacterium simiae and Mycobacterium gordonae.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of NTM in adults with non-CF bronchiectasis has been on the rise and the most common subspecies changed greatly in recent years. More cohort studies should be done in many countries and regions for future estimates.PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020168473.

TI  - The Transcription Factor Zfp335 Promotes Differentiation and Persistence ofMemory CD8(+) T Cells by Regulating TCF-1.
LID - ji2200026 [pii]
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2200026 [doi]
AB  - Memory CD8(+) T cells play an essential role in providing effective and lifelong protection against pathogens. Comprehensive transcriptional and epigeneticnetworks are involved in modulating memory T cell development, but the molecular regulations of CD8(+) memory T cell formation and long-term persistence remainlargely unknown. In this study, we show that zinc finger protein 335 (Zfp335) is indispensable for CD8(+) T cell memory establishment and maintenance during acuteinfections. Mice with Zfp335 deletion in CD8(+) T cells exhibit a significantreduction of memory T cells and memory precursor cells in the contraction phase. Zfp335 deficiency in CD8(+) T cells resulted in decreased expression of memoryfeatured genes Eomes and IL-2Rbeta, leading to a loss of memory identity and anincrease of apoptosis in response to IL-7 and IL-15. Mechanistically, Zfp335directly binds to and regulates TCF-1, known to be critical for memory T celldevelopment. Importantly, overexpression TCF-1 could rescue the defects in thesurvival of both CD8(+) memory precursors and memory T cells caused by Zfp335deficiency. Collectively, our findings reveal that Zfp335 serves as a noveltranscriptional factor upstream of TCF-1 in regulating CD8(+) T cell memory.

AB  - Novel almazole D-amide conjugates, esters, and N-alkylated analogs weresynthesized and investigated for their anticancer activity against seven cancercell lines. Among the series, compounds 5g and 5m showed significant anticanceractivities against multiple cell lines with moderate selectivity indices.Compound 5g had IC50 values of 5.86 +/- 0.31, 9.94 +/- 0.06, 12.74 +/- 0.12, and 9.40 +/- 0.03 muM against the B16-F10, DU145, HeLa, and LC-540 cell lines,respectively, while compound 5m showed IC50 values of 6.35 +/- 0.09, 9.17 +/-0.11, 9.00 +/- 0.011, 19.65 +/- 0.63, 8.13 +/- 0.04, and 11.56 +/- 0.01 muMagainst B16-F10, DU145, HeLa, HepG2, LC-540, and SK-BR-3 cells, respectively.Compared to almazole D, which only showed significant activity against B16-F10cells (IC50 = 9.05 +/- 0.008 muM), the synthesized analogs showed improvedanticancer activity against multiple cell lines. The kinase inhibition assaycoupled with the docking studies revealed that epidermal growth factor receptor(EGFR) kinase inhibition via interaction with amino acid residue T790 on the EGFRis one of the possible mechanisms by which 5g exerts its anticancer potential.The ADMET prediction and drug-likeness of the analogs project the synthesizedanalogs as promising agents, which can be further developed for application incancer therapy.

MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: From January 2018 to December 2020, data from the Seoul ClinicalLaboratories on vaginal swab cultures were retrospectively analyzed to detectmaternal GBS carriers. Each swab specimen was inoculated onto a 5% blood agarplate and incubated at 35-37 in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h. GBS isolates wereidentified using a Microflex MALDI Biotyper. Antimicrobial susceptibility testswere performed using the Vitek 2 automated system. RESULTS: The overallnationwide GBS colonization rate in pregnant Korean women was found to be 10.6%(3578/33721). The maternal GBS colonization rates ranged from 10.5%-10.8% overthe 3-year study period. The GBS colonization rates by province, in descendingorder, were as follows: Jeolla-do, 13.2%; Gangwon-do, 12.0%; Chungcheong-do,11.8%; Gyeonggi-do, 11.3%; Seoul, 10.2%; and Gyeongsang-do, 9.6%. During thestudy period, the resistance rates against chloramphenicol, levofloxacin,clindamycin, erythromycin, and tetracycline were 2.6%-2.7%, 18.2%-19.6%,33.4%-35.7%, 35.6%-36.8%, and 50.5%-53.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: In pregnant Korean women, GBS colonization rates were in the range of 9.6%-13.2%, withGyeongsang-do being the lowest and Jeolla-do the highest. The resistance rateagainst clindamycin was high (33.4%-35.7%). GBS colonization rates duringpregnancy should be studied nationwide according to the Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention-recommended guidelines with periodic antimicrobialresistance monitoring.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae(ESBL-PE) are a major public health concern worldwide. Little is known about the prevalence of ESBL-PE colonization in rehabilitation wards in France. Our aim wasto determine the prevalence of ESBL-PE colonization in rehabilitation wards inthe Parisian area and to identify potential risk factors for ESBL-PE carriage.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This one-day prospective study was performed in threerehabilitation wards in Paris, France, between September 1, 2016, and June 26,2017. Rectal samples were collected for microbial analysis from patients who werepresent at 8am and all isolates recovered were identified by mass spectrometry.The presence of ESBL-PE was confirmed using a double-disk synergy test according to EUCAST recommendations. Risk factors for colonization were determined byunivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 136 patients wereanalyzed (50.7% of female patients; median age 71 years). Twenty-eight patients(20.6%) were colonized with ESBL-PE on the day of sampling. Escherichia coli was identified in 15 (50%) cases and Klebsiella pneumoniae in six (20%). None of the variables studied was significantly associated with a higher risk of ESBL-PEcolonization. However, there was a tendency for a higher risk of ESBL-PEcolonization with dementia (OR=6.116 [95%CI: 0.92-40.57]; p=0.06) and diabeteswith complications (OR=2.853 [95%CI: 1-8.16]; p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients inrehabilitation wards showed a high rate of ESBL-PE colonization (21%). Continuousmonitoring of antibiotic resistance among potentially pathogenic bacteria,including ESBL-PE, is crucial as colonized patients represent an importantreservoir for transmission after discharge outside the hospital setting.

LID - tpmd210746 [pii]
AB  - Diphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease and is caused by toxigenic strains ofCorynebacterium diphtheriae. Several case reports have been published in therecent years, and this resurgence of cases has occurred mainly in adolescent and adult populations. Also, several research articles have reported waning immunity against diphtheria in adults who have completed childhood immunization. Thus, it is an important need to conduct larger sero-surveillance studies to understandthe cause of rising diphtheria cases. Here, we report a case of a 23-year-oldpregnant women of 8 weeks' gestation who presented to the outpatient departmentwith fever, severe throat pain, odynophagia, dysphagia, neck pain, and neckswelling of 3 days' duration. On clinical examination, a gray, leathery membrane was noted on the soft palate. An Albert's stain from the membrane revealedorganisms resembling Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Appropriate treatment wasinitiated immediately, and follow-up examination at 2 weeks from date ofdischarge was uneventful. The gray membrane had completely resolved. Contacttracing was done and the appropriate antimicrobial agent was administered. Thiscase study indicates the importance of timely clinical and microbiologicaldiagnosis and reinforces the previously reported resurgence of diphtheriainfection.

AB  - Iron metabolism are frequently disrupted in cancer. Patients with cancer areprone to anemia and receive transfusions frequently; the condition which results in iron overload, contributing to serious therapeutic complications. Iron isintroduced as a carcinogen that may increase tumor growth. However,investigations regarding its impact on response to chemotherapy, particularly theinduction of drug resistance are still limited. Here, iron contribution to cellsignaling and various molecular mechanisms underlying iron-mediated drugresistance are described. A dual role of this vital element in cancer treatmentis also addressed. On one hand, the need to administer iron chelators to surmountiron overload and improve the sensitivity of tumor cells to chemotherapy isdiscussed. On the other hand, the necessary application of iron as a therapeutic option by iron-oxide nanoparticles or ferroptosis inducers is explained. Authors hope that this paper can help unravel the clinical complications related to iron in cancer therapy.

AB  - Increased poaching in northern South Africa has necessitated relocation of large numbers of southern white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) to the EasternCape Province. The climate and grassland ecology of this province differ fromthat of northern South Africa which may impact the health of this species. Thisassessment of fecal steroid levels and microbiome in 10 free-ranging southernwhite rhinoceros in the Eastern Cape will provide insights into white rhinoceros physiology in this biome. Fecal steroid metabolites were analyzed using enzymeimmunoassay (EIA) and ultra-performance convergence chromatography tandem massspectrometry (UPC(2)-MS/MS). Fecal microbial composition was assessed via nextgeneration sequencing. EIAs with antibodies raised against progesterone (P4;mouse monoclonal - CL425 clone), testosterone (T; rabbit polyclonal),corticosterone (B; sheep polyclonal) were utilized. Pregnant females had largequantities of fecal progesterone metabolites (FPMs) detected by CL425 EIA.Pregnant females also had native P4 and 11alpha-hydroxydihydroprogesterone(11alphaOHDHP4; 4-pregnen-11alpha-ol-3,20-dione) detected by UPC(2)-MS/MS butthese concentrations were 1000-fold less than the concentrations of FPMs detectedby the CL425 EIA. By contrast, non-pregnant females had FPM concentrationsdetected by CL425 EIA which were similar to native P4 and 11alphaOHDHP4concentrations detected by UPC(2)-MS/MS. Mean fecal androgen metabolite (FAM)concentrations detected by the T EIA were similar between males and females.11-ketoandrostenedione (11KA4) detected by UPC(2)-MS/MS was higher in femalesthan males. However, there was no difference between males and females in theconcentration of fecal glucocorticoid metabolites (FGMs) detected by the B EIA.Bacteroidia, followed by Clostridia, was the most abundant classes of fecalmicrobes. The unfiltered microbiome of females was more diverse than that ofmales. The core fecal microbiome of young rhinoceros had a higher observedspecies richness (Shannon diversity index, and Simpson diversity index) than thatof old rhinoceros. In the alpha male, immobilization was associated with anincrease in FGMs detected by 11-deoxycortisol (S) detected by UPC(2)-MS/MScoupled with decreased abundance of Spirochaetia. We detected substantiallydifferent FAM and FPM concentrations from those previously reported for bothcaptive and wild white rhinoceros. Comparison of our UPC(2)-MS/MS and EIA resultsunderscores the fact that most EIAs are highly cross reactive for many steroidmetabolites. Our data also demonstrates a distinct effect of stress not only onFGMs but also on the fecal microbiome. This is the first non-invasive assessment of fecal steroid metabolites by UPC(2)-MS/MS and the fecal microbiome in wildwhite rhinoceros.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the impact of hepatic androgen receptor (AR) pathway onliver pathogenesis was documented, its physiological function in normal liver is remained unclear. This study aims to investigate if hepatic AR acts onmetabolism, the major liver function, using a hepatic-specific AR-transgenic(H-ARTG) mouse model. METHODS: We established the albumin promoter driven H-ARTG mice and included wild type (WT) and H-ARKO mice for study. The body weight,specific metabolic parameters and results from various tolerance tests werecompared in different groups of mice fed a chow diet, from 2 to 18months of age. Glucose feeding and insulin treatment were used to study the expression and zonaldistribution pattern of AR and related genes in liver at different prandialstages. RESULTS: The body weight of H-ARTG mice fed a chow diet was 15% lowerthan that of wild-type mice, preceded by lower blood glucose and livertriglyceride levels caused by AR reduced hepatic gluconeogenesis. The oppositephenotypes identified in H-ARKO and castrated H-ARTG mice support the criticalrole of activated AR in decreasing gluconeogenesis and triglyceride levels inliver. Hepatic AR acting by enhancing the expression of cytosolicglycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (cGPDH), a key of glycerophosphate shuttle,was identified as one mechanism to decrease gluconeogenesis from glycerol. Wefurther found AR normally expressed in zone 3 of hepatic lobules. Its levelfluctuates dependent on the demand of glucose, decreased by fasting but increasedby glucose uptake or insulin stimulation. CONCLUSION: AR is a newly identifiedzone 3 hepatic gene with function in reducing blood glucose and body weight inmice. It suggests that stabilization of hepatic AR is a new direction to prevent hyperglycemia, obesity and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in males.

AB  - Although SARS-CoV-2 can cause severe illness and death, a percentage of theinfected population is asymptomatic. This, along with other factors, such asinsufficient diagnostic testing and underreporting due to self-testing,contributes to the silent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and highlights theimportance of implementing additional surveillance tools. The fecal shedding ofthe virus from infected individuals enables its detection in communitywastewater, and this has become a valuable public health tool worldwide as itallows the monitoring of the disease on a populational scale. Here, we monitored the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and its dynamic genomic changes in wastewater sampled from two metropolitan areas in Arkansas during major surges of COVID-19 cases andassessed how the viral titers in these samples related to the clinical casecounts between late April 2020 and January 2022. The levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNAwere quantified by reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction(RT-qPCR) using a set of TaqMan assays targeting three different viral genes(encoding ORF1ab polyprotein, surface glycoprotein, and nucleocapsidphosphoprotein). An allele-specific RT-qPCR approach was used to screen thesamples for SARS-CoV-2 mutations. The identity and genetic diversity of the viruswere further investigated through amplicon-based RNA sequencing, and SARS-CoV-2variants of concern were detected in wastewater samples throughout the durationof this study. Our data show how changes in the virus genome can affect thesensitivity of specific RT-qPCR assays used in COVID-19 testing with the surge ofnew variants. A significant association was observed between viral titers inwastewater and recorded number of COVID-19 cases in the areas studied, exceptwhen assays failed to detect targets due to the presence of particular variants. These findings support the use of wastewater surveillance as a reliablecomplementary tool for monitoring SARS-CoV-2 and its genetic variants at thecommunity level.

AB  - Interfacial reactions between iron (Fe) (hydr)oxide surfaces and the activity of bacteria during dissimilatory Fe reduction affect extracellular electrontransfer. The presence of organic matter (OM) and exposed facets of Fe(hydr)oxides influence this process. However, the underlying interfacialmechanism of facet-dependent hematite and its toxicity toward microbes duringbioreduction in the presence of OM remains unknown. Herein, humic acid (HA), astypical OM, was selected to investigate its effect on the bioreduction ofhematite {100} and {001}. When HA concentration was increased from 0 to500mgL(-1), the bioreduction rates increased from 0.02h(-1) to 0.04h(-1) forhematite {100} and from 0.026h(-1) to 0.05h(-1) for hematite {001}. Sincehematite {001} owned lower resistance than hematite {100} irrespective of the HA concentration, and hematite {100} was less favorable for reduction.Microscopy-based analysis showed that more hematite {001} nanoparticles adheredto the cell surface and were bound more closely to the bacteria. Moreover, lesscell damage was observed in the HA-hematite {001} treatments. As the reactionprogressed, some bacterial cells died or were inactivated; confocal laserscanning microscopy showed that bacterial survival was higher in the HA-hematite {001} treatments than in the HA-hematite {100} treatments after bioreduction.Spectroscopic analysis revealed that facet-dependent binding was primarilyrealized by surface complexation of carboxyl functional groups with structural Featoms, and that the binding order of HA functional groups and hematite wasaffected by the exposed facets. The exposed facets of hematite could influencethe electrochemical properties and activity of bacteria, as well as the bindingof bacteria and Fe oxides in the presence of OM, thereby governing theextracellular electron transfer and concomitant bioreduction of Fe (hydr)oxides. These results provide new insights into the interfacial reactions between OM and facet-dependent Fe oxides in anoxic, OM-rich soil and sediment environments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide difference (Pcv-aCO2)is a biomarker for tissue perfusion, but the diagnostic value of Pcv-aCO2 inbacteria bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by gram-negative (GN) bacteriaremains unclear. This study evaluated the expression levels and diagnostic value of Pcv-aCO2 and procalcitonin (PCT) in the early stages of GN bacteria BSI.METHODS: Patients with BSI admitted to the intensive care unit at GuangdongProvincial People's Hospital between August 2014 and August 2017 were enrolled.Pcv-aCO2 and PCT levels were evaluated in GN and gram-positive (GP) bacteria BSI patients. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients with BSI were enrolled. The Pcv-aCO2(8.32 +/- 3.59 vs 4.35 +/- 2.24 mmHg p=0.001) and PCT (30.62 +/- 34.51 vs 4.92+/- 6.13 ng/ml p=0.001) levels were significantly higher in the GN group than in the GP group. In the diagnosis of GN bacteria BSI, the area under the receiveroperating characteristic curve (AUROC) for Pcv-aCO2 was 0.823 (95% confidenceinterval (CI): 0.746-0.900). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictivevalue (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 71.90%, 88.00%, 74.07% and78.21%, respectively. The AUROC for PCT was 0.818 (95% CI: 0.745-0.890). Thesensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV were 57.90%, 94.67%, 71.93% and 74.67%,respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Pcv-aCO2 and PCT have similar and high diagnosticvalue for the early diagnosis of BSI caused by GN bacteria.

AB  - Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii), as an intracellular protozoan parasite, has thepotential to disturb the homeostasis of trace metal elements in host cells. Zinc (Zn) is one of those essential metals that is required for combating infection.Zinc cellular homeostasis is controlled by zinc membrane transporters, including efflux and influx transporters. One of the Zrt-Irt-like protein (ZIP)transporters, ZIP8, facilitates zinc influx into the cytosol. It was recentlyreported to play significant roles in facilitating Zn uptakes during infection.Here, we investigated the function of ZIP8 in host defense against T. gondiiinfection in cultured alpha mouse liver 12 (AML12) hepatocytes and mice, withloss of ZIP8 function. Herein, C57BL/6J female wild-type (WT) and ZIP8-KD mice(Slc39a8 knockdown mice), that were infected with tachyzoites ofToxoDB#9(TgCtwh3), were used as a model of acute toxoplasmosis. AML12 hepatocyteswere transfected with lentivirus (LV), with silenced ZIP8 expression. Finally, weobserved the function of hepatocytes pretreated with ZnCl2 before TgCtwh3infection in vivo and in vitro. In vivo, the levels of zinc ions and ZIP8 proteinwere upregulated after TgCtwh3 infection. ZIP8 knockdown exacerbated liverdamage, further decreased antioxidant enzyme activity, promoted inflammatorymediator expression, and upregulated the rate of apoptosis. ZnCl2 pretreatmentbefore TgCtwh3 infection improved liver injury, increased antioxidant enzymeactivity, restrained the expression of inflammatory mediators, and decreased the rate of apoptosis. The results in vitro were almost the same as those in vivo.This study defines the function of ZIP8-dependent zinc in hepatocyte damageduring intracellular pathogen infection. Reagents that regulate ZIP8 activitymight be developed as therapeutics to protect the liver function oftoxoplasmosis.

AB  - RNA helicases represent attractive drug targets as their activity is linked toseveral human diseases and impacts microbial infectious processes. While someinhibitors of human RNA helicases demonstrated therapeutic potential asanticancer and antiviral drugs in preclinical trials, chemical inhibition ofmicrobial RNA helicases is less investigated. Here, we address this matter byfocusing on the RhlE proteobacterial group of RNA helicases. Having previouslyshown that the RhlE2 RNA helicase is important for the virulence of theopportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we screened a library of 1280molecules for inhibitors of RhlE2 RNA-dependent ATP hydrolytic activity. The mostpotent inhibitor is the diazo compound Chicago Sky Blue (CSB). Usinghydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry and biochemical assays, we mappedCSB binding to RhlE2 catalytic core and defined its inhibitory mechanism.Targeting microbial RNA helicases as therapeutic strategy is challenging due topotential side-effects linked to protein conservation across life kingdoms.Interestingly, our structure-activity relationship analysis delineates otherdiazo dyes closely related to CSB differentially affecting RhlE homologs. Ourwork could thus be exploited for future drug development studies, which areextremely timely considering the increasing spread of antibiotic resistance amongbacterial pathogens.

AB  - Tissue engineering offers a promising treatment strategy for ureteral strictures,but its success requires an in-depth understanding of the architecture, cellular heterogeneity, and signaling pathways underlying tissue regeneration. Here, wedefine and spatially map cell populations within the human ureter usingsingle-cell RNA sequencing, spatial gene expression, and immunofluorescenceapproaches. We focus on the stromal and urothelial cell populations to enumerate the distinct cell types composing the human ureter and infer potential cell-cell communication networks underpinning the bi-directional crosstalk between thesecompartments. Furthermore, we analyze and experimentally validate the importance of the sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway in adult progenitor cellmaintenance. The SHH-expressing basal cells support organoid generation in vitro and accurately predict the differentiation trajectory from basal progenitor cellsto terminally differentiated umbrella cells. Our results highlight the essential processes involved in adult ureter tissue homeostasis and provide a blueprint forguiding ureter tissue engineering.

AB  - Cistus ladanifer L. is a Mediterranean shrub, well recognized for its manypharmacological properties. The present study aimed to investigate thephytochemical profile, the in vivo anti-inflammatory and the wound healingactivities of the aqueous extract from its aerial parts (AECL). The in vivoanti-inflammatory and the wound healing properties were evaluated bycarrageenan-induced paw edema (CAECL) and burn wound in rats, respectively. Theresults showed that six compounds belonging to flavonoids and tannins wereidentified in the AECL extract. Moreover, the AECL administrated orally at a doseof 500 mg/kg significantly reduced edema with a percentage of 72 % in terms ofinflammation inhibition, using indomethacin as reference drug. On the other hand,when administrated topically, both doses of CAECL cream (5 % and 10 %) manifesteda significant anti-inflammatory action using diclofenac as reference drug with a percentage reduction of inflammation that reached 85 % (CAECL-10). As far aswound healing is concerned, the CAECL showed higher effect at a dose of 10 %(CAECL-10) producing a wound contraction of 96 %, similar to that of thereference drug. The findings of the present study indicate that the aqueousextract from aerial parts of Cistus ladanifer L. display stronglyanti-inflammatory and wound healing effects to be advantageously used for medicalpurposes.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of polyethylene and polyvinyl chloridemicroplastics on the UV fluence response curve for the inactivation ofmultidrug-resistant E. coli and enterococci in ultrapure water at pH 6.0 +/- 0.1.In the absence of microplastics, the UV inactivation of the studied bacteriaexhibited an initial resistance followed by a faster inactivation of free(dispersed) bacteria, while in the presence of microplastics, these 2 regimeswere followed by an additional regime of slower or no inactivation related tomicroplastic-associated bacteria (i.e., bacteria aggregated with microplasticsresulting in shielding bacteria from UV indicated by tailing at higher UVfluences). The magnitude of the negative effect of microplastics varied withdifferent microplastics (type/particle size) and bacteria (Gram-negative andGram-positive). Results showed that when the UV transmittance of themicroplastic-containing water was not taken into account in calculating UVfluences, the effect of microplastics as protectors of bacteria wasoverestimated. A UV fluence-based double-exponential microbial inactivation modelaccounting for both free and microplastic-associated bacteria could describe wellthe disinfection data. The present study elucidated the effect of microplasticson the performance of UV disinfection, and the approach used herein to prove thisconcept may guide future research on the investigation of the possible effect of other particles including nanoplastics with different characteristics on theexposure response curve for the inactivation of various microorganisms byphysical and chemical disinfection processes in different water and wastewatermatrices.

AB  - Mammalian genomes are methylated on carbon-5 of many cytosines, mostly in CpGdinucleotides. Methylation patterns are maintained during mitosis via DNMT1, and regulatory factors involved in processes that include histone modifications.Methylation in a sequence longer than CpG can influence the binding ofsequence-specific transcription factors, thus affecting gene expression.5-Methylcytosine deamination results in C-to-T transition. While some mutationsare beneficial, most are not; so boosting C-to-T transitions can be dangerous.Given the role of DNMT3A in establishing de novo DNA methylation duringdevelopment, it is this CpG methylation and deamination that provide the majormutagenic impetus in the DNMT3A gene itself, including the R882Hdominant-negative substitution associated with two diseases: germline mutationsin DNMT3A overgrowth syndrome, and somatic mutations in clonal hematopoiesis thatcan initiate acute myeloid leukemia. We discuss recent developments intherapeutics targeting DNMT1, the role of noncatalytic isoform DNMT3B3 inregulating de novo methylation by DNMT3A, and structural characterization ofDNMT3A in various configurations.

AB  - Campylobacter (C.) spp. represent one of the most important causes for food-bornebacterial pathogen in humans worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate metabolic requirements of two Campylobacter strains of different species based onsubstrate utilisation (in vitro). Based on these results, a correlation betweenthe colonisation and the available substrates in different intestinal sectionswas recorded using an animal model. Campylobacter coli (ST-5777) and C. jejuni(ST-122) were used to inoculate 16 pigs, respectively, and one group of 16 pigswas used as control. The strains differed significantly in substrate utilisation - C. coli was able to metabolise various substrates (acetate, asparagine, serine,fucose, and propionate), while C. jejuni only utilised serine. Metabolomicanalysis of intestinal content from different gut sections showed the presence ofall previously tested metabolites, except for fucose. A significantly largeramount of glucose was found in the jejunum of those pigs infected with C. coli,while neither strain utilised it in vitro. The analysis of the intestinalcontents revealed a very low proportion of Campylobacterales in the totalmicrobiome, suggesting that the small percentage of the inoculated Campylobacter strains in the gut microflora of the animals is too low to cause differencesbetween the control and infected groups in the composition of the metabolome.Nevertheless, knowledge of specific nutritional requirements of the pathogenscombined with proof of different metabolites in the intestinal segments mayprovide clues about the site of colonisation in the host and improve ourunderstanding of this zoonotic germ.

AB  - Escherichia coli is the most common cause of economic loss in swine industry.Nowadays, bacteriophages have been proven as good candidates for controllingbacterial infections. In this study, 6 phages were isolated and selected based ontheir high efficacy against 11 stains of E. coli isolated from diarrheal pigs.Six groups of weaned piglets were assigned (control, bacterial control (BC), two phage control (PC) and two phage treatment (PT) groups). Two titers (2 x 10(9)PFU/animal and 2 x 10(10) PFU/animal) of phage cocktails consisting of thesephages were tested in the PC and PT groups via oral gavage at 24, 48, and 72 hagainst an E. coli cocktail (2 x 10(9) CFU/animal) that was given to the piglets at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h of the trial. A significant reduction of fecal E. colicounts was observed in both PT groups from day 1 to 7 following the final phagedosage when compared to those of the BC group. Microbiomes in feces obtained 24 hafter the final phage administration revealed phage therapy with both dosagescould restore the gut's bacterial composition. Moreover, the given phagecocktails resulted in a significantly higher average daily gain of piglets duringthe first few weeks in both PC groups and the PT group receiving a higher phagedosage. These findings suggest that bacteriophages might be a potentialalternative to antibiotics in the treatment of pathogens. In addition, they couldalso be utilized to improve pig growth performance.

AB  - Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a severe inflammatory skin disease caused by acombination of genetic, immune, and environmental factors. Intestinal microbiome disorders and changes in the immune microenvironment are associated with AD. Weobserved that gut bacterial metabolite enterolactone (ENL) was significantlyreduced in AD model mice. Notably, patients with early childhood-onset ADexhibited decreased sera ENL level compared to the healthy controls, and the ENL level was negatively correlated with the SCORAD index.Secoisolariciresinol-diglycoside (SDG) is a natural dietary lignan of flaxseedsthat can be converted by intestinal bacteria to ENL. Repeated applications of2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB) were performed on the ear and dorsal skin of miceto induce AD-like symptoms and skin lesions. Oral administration of SDGsignificantly decreased serum IgE levels and limited skin inflammation in theDNCB-induced AD mice. In addition, SDG treatment strongly limited the Th2responses in AD mice. Moreover, we demonstrated that the IL-4 production wassignificantly suppressed by ENL under Th2 polarization conditions via theJAK-STAT6 signaling pathway in a concentration-dependent manner. We concludedthat SDG and its derived metabolite ENL ameliorated AD development by reducingthe Th2 immune response. These results suggested that SDG and ENL might beexploited as potential therapeutic candidates for AD treatment.

AB  - Coral diseases contribute to the rapid degradation of coral reefs on a globalscale. Although widespread in tropical and subtropical reefs, disease outbreakshave not been described in warm temperate areas. Here, we report the outbreak of a new coral disease in a warm temperate marginal coral community in Japan.Outbreaks of the disease have been observed during the summer and autumn monthssince 2014. It affects the coral species Porites heronensis and was tentativelynamed "White Mat Syndrome" (WMS) as it consists of a white microbial matdominated by Thiothrix sp., a sulfide oxidizing bacteria. Outbreaks followed highseasonal temperatures and were associated with the macroalga Gelidium elegans,which acts as a pathogen reservoir. With ocean warming and the anticipatedincrease in novel coral-algae interactions as some coral species shift poleward, WMS and emerging diseases could hinder the role of temperate areas as a futurecoral refuge.

AB  - Antibiotics, the primary drugs used to cure bacterial diseases, are increasingly becoming ineffective due to the emergence of multiple drug resistance (MDR)leading to recurrence of previously sensitive pathogens. Human gut microbiome(GM), known to play an important role in various physiological processes,consists of pool of diverse microbes. Indiscriminate use of antibiotics duringthe life span of an individual may lead to development of resistant microbes e.g.Vibrio, Acinetobacter, Escherichia, Klebsiella, Clostridia, etc. in the human GM.Transmission of antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) between pathogenic andcommensal bacteria occurs more frequently in microbiome communities whereinbacteria communicate and exchange cellular constituents both among themselves andwith the host. Additionally, co-factors like 'early vs. late' exposure, type ofantibiotics and duration of treatment modulate the adverse effects of antibioticson GM maturation. Furthermore, factors like mode of birth, ethnicity,malnutrition, demography, diet, lifestyle, etc., which influence GM composition, can also indirectly alter the host response to antibiotics. Currently, advanced'omics' and culturomics approaches are revealing novel avenues to study theinterplay between antibiotics and the microbiome and to identify resistant genes in these bacterial communities. Here, we discuss the recent developments thathave given insights into the effects of antibiotics on the homeostatic balance ofthe gut microbiome and thus on human health.

The presentwork demonstrates the role of vitexin in modulating Staphylococcus aureus surfacehydrophobicity while aggregating to form biofilm and pathogenesis in a host. Inplanktonic form, vitexin shows minimum inhibitory concentration at 252 microg/ml against S. aureus. Sub-MIC doses of vitexin and antibiotics (26 microg/ml ofvitexin, 55 microg/ml of azithromycin, and 2.5 microg/ml of gentamicin) wereselected to treat S. aureus. Dead cell counts after treatment were studiedthrough flow cytometry. As dead cell counts were minimal (<5 %), these doses wereconsidered for all subsequent experiments. While studying aggregating cells, itwas observed that vitexin reduces S. aureus surface hydrophobicity and membranepermeability at the sub-MIC dose of 26 microg/ml. The in silico binding analysis showed a higher binding affinity of vitexin with surface proteins (IcaA, DltA,and SasG) of S. aureus. Down-regulation of dltA and icaAB expression, along with the reduction in membrane potential with a sub-MIC dose of vitexin, explainsreduced S. aureus surface hydrophobicity. Vitexin was found to interfere with S. aureus biofilm-associated protein biomass, EPS production, and swarming movement.Subsequently, the suppression of proteases production and down-regulation oficaAB and agrAC gene expression with a sub-MIC dose of vitexin explained theinhibition of S. aureus virulence in vitro. Besides, vitexin was also found topotentiate the antibiofilm activity of sub-MIC doses of gentamicin andazithromycin. Treatment with vitexin exhibits a protective response in S. aureus infected macrophages through modulation of expression of cytokines like IL-10 andIL-12p40 at protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, CFU count and histologicalexamination of infected mouse tissue (liver and spleen) justify the in vivoprotective effect of vitexin from S. aureus biofilm-associated infection. Fromthis study, it can be inferred that vitexin can reduce S. aureus surfacehydrophobicity, leading to interference with aggregation at the time of biofilmformation and subsequent pathogenesis in a host.

AB  - In recent years, cutting-edge nanotechnology research has revolutionized several facets of the food business, including food processing, packaging,transportation, preservation, and functioning. Nanotechnology has beginning toloom large in the food business as the industry's demand for biogenicnanomaterial grows. The intracellular and extracellular synthesis of metal, metaloxide, and other essential NPs has recently been explored in a variety ofmicroorganisms, including bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, yeasts, microalgae, andviruses. These microbes produce a variety extracellular material,exopolysaccharides, enzymes, and secondary metabolites which play key roles insynthesizing as well as stabilizing the nanoparticle (NPs). Furthermore, genetic engineering techniques can help them to improve their capacity to generate NPsmore efficiently. As a result, using microorganisms to manufacture NPs is unique and has a promising future. Microbial-mediated synthesis of NPs has lately beenpopular as a more environmentally friendly alternative to physical and chemicalmethods of nanomaterial synthesis, which require higher prices, more energyconsumption, and more complex reaction conditions, as well as a potentiallydangerous environmental impact. It is critical to consider regulatory measuresimplemented at all stages of the process, from production through refining,packaging, preservation, and storage, when producing bionanomaterials derivedfrom culturable microbes for efficient food preservation. The current reviewdiscusses the synthesis, mechanism of action, and possible food preservation usesof microbial mediated NPs, which can assist to minimize food deterioration fromthe inside out while also ensuring that food is safe and free of contaminants.Despite the numerous benefits, there are looming debates concerning their usagein food items, particularly regarding its aggregation in human bodies and otherrisks to the environment. Other applications and impacts of thesemicrobe-fabricated NPs in the context of future food preservation prospectsconnected with regulatory problems and potential hazards are highlighted.

AB  - Many bacteria use small-molecule chelators called metallophores to acquire trace metals from their environment. These molecules play a central role ininteractions between bacteria, plants, and animals. Hence, knowing their fulldiversity is key to combatting infectious diseases as well as harnessingbeneficial microbial communities. Metallophore discovery has been streamlined by advances in genome mining, where genomes are scanned for genes involved inmetallophore biosynthesis. This review highlights recent trends and advances inpredicting the presence and structure of metallophores based solely on genomicinformation. Recent work suggests new families of metallophores remain hiddenfrom current homology-based approaches. Their discovery will require new genomemining approaches that move beyond biosynthesis to consider metallophoretransporters, regulation, and evolution.

AB  - As an alternative for commercial enzyme, crude enzyme of fungal mash couldpromote food waste (FW) hydrolysis, but its specific effects coupled pH adjustingon the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) remains unknown. The crudeenzyme produced from an Aspergillus awamori, named complex-amylase (CA), wasadded to short-term anaerobic system of FW fermentation. Results showed thatadding CA significantly improved the solubility and degradability ofbiodegradable and non-biodegradable organics in FW, where the SCOD concentration with adding CA increased by 116.9% relative to the control but a marginalenhancement on VFAs yield. In contrast, adding CA combined with adjusting pH 8markedly increased the VFAs production to 32.0 g COD/L, almost 10 times as muchas the control. Besides, pH adjusting altered the metabolic pathway fromlactate-type to butyrate-type. Adding CA coupled pH adjusting significantincrease the component of butyrate compared with pH adjusting alone. Moreover,microbial community analysis indicated that adding CA reinforced proportion ofthe butyrate-producing bacteria (e.g., Dialister) under basic conditions, thusenhancing the butyrate metabolic pathways. This study demonstrated that fungalmash pretreatment coupled pH conditioning could be an economical way to enhanceVFAs yield for FW valorization during anaerobic fermentation.

AB  - To improve cross-protection of influenza vaccination, we tested conjugation ofconserved M2e epitopes to the surface of inactivated influenza virus (iPR8-M2e*).Treatment of virus with chemical cross-linker led to diminished hemagglutination activity and failure to induce hemagglutination inhibiting antibodies. ConjugatediPR8-M2e* vaccine was less protective against homologous and heterosubtypicviruses, despite the induction of virus-specific binding IgG antibodies. Inalternative approaches to enhance cross-protection, we developed a geneticallylinked chimeric protein (M2e-B stalk) vaccine with M2e of influenza A andhemagglutinin (HA) stalk of influenza B virus. Vaccination of mice withinactivated influenza A virus supplemented with M2e-B stalk effectively inducedhemagglutination inhibiting antibodies, humoral and cellular M2e immuneresponses, and enhanced heterosubtypic protection. This study demonstrates theimportance of HA functional integrity in influenza vaccine efficacy and thatsupplementation of influenza vaccines with M2e-B stalk protein could be afeasible strategy of improving cross-protection against influenza viruses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a viral zoonotic disease that has been found in several countries of Asia and is responsible for high mortality andmorbidity of men and animals in rural and sub-urban endemic areas due to thevirus re-circulation among diverse hosts and vectors. The present study estimatesthe prevalence of the JE virus in the vector and animal population of the Asiancontinent using a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: The Cochrancollaborators' Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis[PRISMA] guidelines were used for systematic review and meta-analysis. Theheterogeneity was observed in meta-regression analysis due to several factorsincluding region, species, and different diagnostic assays used in variousstudies. Thus we did sensitivity and subgroup analysis. RESULTS: The prevalenceof the JE virus was calculated using a total sample size of 47,391. Subgroupanalysis revealed the JE virus prevalence of 39% in the Southeast Asia region,followed by East Asia with 35% and South Asia with 15% prevalence. Hence, theoverall pooled prevalence of the JE virus was 26% in the Asian continent.CONCLUSIONS: The highest proportion of infection was found in pigs amongst allanimals, reinforcing the fact that they can be used as sentinels to predictoutbreaks in humans. The findings of this study will enable researchers andpolicymakers in better understanding the disease's spatial and temporaldistribution, as well as in creating and implementing location-specific JEprevention and control measures.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), whichcauses coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has spread globally. The majorreservoir for SARS-CoV-2 transmission remains controversial, with the airborneroute remaining a possible transmission vehicle for carrying the virus withinindoor environments. This study aimed to detect contamination of SARS-CoV-2 inhigh-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters within hospital isolation rooms ofconfirmed COVID-19 patients, exploring the role of nano-treatment of thesefilters with silver and titanium dioxide nanoparticles (Ag/TiO2 NPs). MATERIALSAND METHODS: We investigated the effectiveness of Ag-NPs/TiO2-treated HEPAfilters in the air of rooms occupied by patients with confirmed COVID-19 in auniversity teaching hospital in the Eastern province of Saudi Arabia during thefirst wave of the pandemic. Ag/TiO2 NPs were designed and coated on HEPA filters to examine the filtration efficiency and antiviral ability in the presence ofaerosolized virus particles. A total of 20 viral swab samples were collected fromfive patients' rooms before and after treatment with nanoparticle-preparedsolutions into the sterile virus-transporting media. Samples were evaluated forSARS-CoV-2 with a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Twosamples taken from the HEPA filter air exhaust outlets prior to nano-treatmenttested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the intensive care unit, which hasstringent aerosolization control procedures, suggesting that small virus-ladendroplets may be displaced by airflow. All air samples collected from the HEPAfilters from the rooms of patients with confirmed COVID-19 followingnano-treatment were negative. CONCLUSION: We recommend further experimentalexploration using a larger number of HEPA filters in areas withaerosol-generating procedures, along with viability studies on the HEPA filtersto facilitate decision-making in high-risk facilities regarding the replacement, storage, and disposal of HEPA filters in wards occupied by cases diagnosed with ahighly transmissible disease.

AB  - Pit latrines provide essential onsite sanitation services to over a billionpeople, but there are concerns about their role in infectious diseasetransmission, and impacts on groundwater resources. We conducted fieldwork in an informal settlement in Dar es Salaam, where cholera is endemic. We combined platecounting with portable MinION sequencing and quantitative polymerase chainreaction (qPCR) methods for characterization of bacteria in pit latrine sludge,leachate, shallow and deep groundwater resources. Pit latrine sludge wascharacterized by log10 marker gene concentrations per 100 mL of 11.2 +/- 0.2, 9.9+/- 0.9, 6.0 +/- 0.3, and 4.4 +/- 0.8, for total bacteria (16S rRNA), E. coli(rodA), human-host-associated Bacteroides (HF183), and Vibrio cholerae (ompW),respectively. The ompW gene observations suggested 5 % asymptomatic Vibriocholerae carriers amongst pit latrine users. Pit leachate percolation throughone-meter-thick sand beds attenuated bacterial hazard indicators by 1 to 4 log10 units. But first-order removal rates derived from these data substantiallyoverestimated the longer-range hazard attenuation in the sand aquifers.Cooccurrence of human sewage marker gene HF183 in all shallow groundwater samplestesting positive for ompW genes demonstrated the human origin of Vibrio cholerae hazards in the subsurface. All borehole water samples tested negative for ompWand HF183 genes, but 16S rRNA gene sequencing data suggested ingress of faecalpollution into boreholes at the peak of the "long rainy season". Quantitativemicrobial risk assessment (QMRA) predicted a gastrointestinal disease burden of0.05 DALY per person per year for the community, well above WHO targets of10(-4)-10(-6) DALY for disease related to drinking water.

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of the UVHER project is to evaluate the risk of development ofoptic nerve damage in patients with herpetic anterior uveitis (AU) prospectively followed over 2 years. Herein, we described the baseline characteristics.METHODS: This is a multicentre, prospective study. An aqueous humour tap wasperformed. Only patients with a positive PCR were included. Clinicalcharacteristics, optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters and visual field(VF) abnormalities were registered. RESULTS: 27 patients were included: 18 HerpesSimplex (HSV), one Varicella Zoster (VVZ), and 8Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Patientswith HSV-AU had severe inflammation, iris atrophy and corneal involvement. Inpatients with CMV-AU, less inflammation and medium-to-large keratic precipitates were observed. OCT showed a thinner RNFL and GCL in CMV-AU patients in comparisonto HSV patients. VF showed abnormalities in six cases. CONCLUSIONS: Patients inthe UVHER cohort showed the typical clinical manifestations of herpetic AU. InCMV patients, optic nerve damage was observed at baseline, and in HSV patients,inflammation was more severe.

TI  - First Report of leaf spot disease caused by Enterobacter mori on Canna indica in China.
LID - 10.1094/PDIS-05-22-1223-PDN [doi]
AB  - Canna indica L. is a popular landscape ornamental herb of family Cannaceaethroughout China. This plant has been extensively cultivated for decoration andas an ornamental in China. C. indica was seriously affected by a disease in thegarden in spring of 2021 with an incidence of 21.2 to 45.6%, and it causedeconomic loss to control plant diseases with chemicals. Both young and olderleaves developed necrotic lesions with small water-soaked spots on leaves, which then enlarged and were bordered by chlorosis. Symptomatic tissues were collected from Zhanjiang city (21.2N110.3E) and Wuchuan city (21.4N110.7E) in Guangdongprovince. Three symptomatic leaves from each city were surface disinfected in a1% hypochlorite solution for 3 mins followed by being rinsed in sterile distilledwater for 3 times. Six bacterial isolates originated from six single colonieswere recovered from the samples. Colonies were raised and opaque with smoothmargins. The bacteria were gram-negative, rod-shaped with sizes ranged from0.4-0.7 mum wide and 1.2-2.0 mum long, without endospore, and were facultativeanaerobes. For molecular identification, the direct colony PCR method (Lu et al. 2012) was used to amplify the 16S rDNA (Moreno et al., 2002), gyrB, leuS and rpoBof 2 selected strains, EM21ZJ1 and EM21WC1 using the primer pairs 27F/1492R,gyrB3/gyrB4, leuS3 /leuS4 and rpoBjt112/ rpoBjt748 respectively (Deletoile etal., 2009). The resulting sequences were deposited in GenBank (ON600470 andON600471 for 16S rDNA; ON600472 and ON600473 for gyrB; ON600474 and ON600475 for LeuS; ON600476 and ON600477 for rpoB). BLAST searches with the four genesequences revealed the greatest similarity with the sequences of Enterobactermori (Zhu et al. 2011). The available complete genome sequences of Enterobacterspecies, especially type strains, were downloaded and the sequences of thecorresponding 4 genes of each genome was extracted by Bioedit software. Theconcatenated sequences were aligned by Mega 11.0 with the neighbor-joiningmethod. Multilocus sequence typing analysis showed that the concatenatedsequences of the 2 isolates were clustered with E. mori with 100% bootstrapvalue. The 2 isolates were selected for pathogenicity tests to fulfill Koch'spostulates. Six plants at three- to five-leaf stage were inoculated with eachisolate separately, 2 sites of each leaf were inoculated, one site was woundedwith a sterile needle and the other was not. The 2 sites of each leaf werecovered with a piece of cotton drenched with 200 microl bacteria suspension (108 CFU/ml) from 2 isolates separately. Control plants were inoculated identicallyexcept Luria-Bertani (LB) medium was used to drench the cotton. Inoculated plantswere placed in an incubator at 25 degrees C, and 80% humidity under a 12-hlight/dark cycle for 7 days. After 3 days of incubation, water-soaked yellowspots were observed in all the inoculated plants in both wounded and unwoundedsites, except the negative control. The water-soaked yellow spots enlarged andbecame necrotic that matched those seen in garden. The pathogenicity tests wereconducted three times with similar results. The bacteria were then reisolatedfrom the lesions and found to have the same colony morphology and 99.9% identity of 16S rDNA sequences as those of the inoculum. According to morphological andsequence analysis, the pathogen was identified as E. mori. To our knowledge, thisis the first report of disease of C. indica caused by E. mori.

TI  - Conformational Changes and H-Bond Rearrangements during Quinone Release inPhotosystem II.
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.2c00324 [doi]
AB  - In photosystem II (PSII) and photosynthetic reaction centers from purple bacteria(PbRC), the electron released from the electronically excited chlorophyll istransferred to the terminal electron acceptor quinone, QB. QB accepts twoelectrons and two protons before leaving the protein. We investigated themolecular mechanism of quinone exchange in PSII, conducting molecular dynamics(MD) simulations and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM)calculations. MD simulations suggest that the release of QB leads to thetransformation of the short helix (D1-Phe260 to D1-Ser264), which is adjacent to the stromal helix de (D1-Asn247 to D1-Ile259), into a loop and to the formationof a water-intake channel. Water molecules enter the QB binding pocket via thechannel and form an H-bond network. QM/MM calculations indicate that the H-bondnetwork serves as a proton-transfer pathway for the reprotonation of D1-His215,the proton donor during QBH(-)/QBH2 conversion. Together with the absence of the corresponding short helix but the presence of Glu-L212 in PbRC, it seems likelythat the two type-II reaction centers undergo quinone exchange via differentmechanisms.

AB  - Autologous stem cell transplant with gene therapy (ASCT-GT) provides curativetherapy while reducing pre-transplant immune-suppressive conditioning andeliminating post-transplant immune suppression. Clonal hematopoiesis ofindeterminate potential (CHIP)-associated mutations increase and telomere lengths(TL) shorten with natural aging and DNA damaging processes. It is possible thatif CHIP is present before ASCT-GT, or mutagenesis occurs due to busulfanexposure, the HSCs carrying these somatic variants may survive the conditioningchemotherapy and have selective reconstitution advantage, increasing risk ofhematologic malignancy and overall mortality. Seventy-four peripheral bloodsamples (ranging from baseline to 120 months post ASCT-GT) from 10 pediatricparticipants who underwent ASCT-GT for adenosine deaminase deficient severecombined immune deficiency (ADA-SCID) following reduced intensity conditioning(RIC) with busulfan and 16 healthy controls were analyzed for TL and CHIP. Oneparticipant had a significant decrease in TL. There were no CHIP-associatedmutations identified by the next generation sequencing (NGS) in any of theADA-SCID participants. This suggests that further studies are needed to determineutility of germline analyses in revealing underlying genetic risk of malignancyin participants undergoing gene therapy. While these results are promising,larger scale studies are needed to corroborate the effect of ASCT-GT on telomere length and CHIP. This trial is registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov asNCT00794508.

AB  - The article highlights the course of long-term SARS-CoV-2 infection in a patient with a secondary immunodeficiency developed with B-cell-depleting therapy of the underlying disease. Analysis of the intrapatient virus evolution revealed aninpatient S:G75A mutation that alters the 72GTNGTKR78 motif of the S-protein,with a possible role in binding to alternative cellular receptors. Therapy with aready-made COVID-19-globulin preparation (native human immunoglobulin G (IgG)derived from the plasma of convalescent COVID-19-patients) resulted in rapidimprovement of the patient's condition, fast, and stable elimination of thevirus, and passive immunization of the patient for at least 30 days. The results suggest the use of products containing neutralizing antibodies opens newprospects for treatment algorithms for patients with persistent coronavirusinfection, as well as for passive immunization schemes for patients with apresumably reduced specific response to vaccination.

AB  - Cellular quiescence is a state of reversible cell cycle arrest that is associatedwith tissue dormancy. Timely regulated entry into and exit from quiescence isimportant for processes such as tissue homeostasis, tissue repair, stem cellmaintenance, developmental processes, and immunity. However, little is knownabout processes that control the mechanical adaption to cell behavior changesduring the transition from quiescence to proliferation. Here, we show thatquiescent human keratinocyte monolayers sustain an actinomyosin-based system thatfacilitates global cell sheet displacements upon serum-stimulated exit fromquiescence. Mechanistically, exposure of quiescent cells to serum-borne mitogens leads to rapid amplification of preexisting contractile sites, leading to a burstin monolayer tension that subsequently drives large-scale displacements ofotherwise motility-restricted monolayers. The stress level after quiescence exit correlates with the level of quiescence depth at the time of activation, and acritical stress magnitude must be reached to overcome the cell sheet displacementbarrier. The study shows that static quiescent cell monolayers are mechanicallypoised for motility, and it identifies global stress amplification as a mechanismfor overcoming motility restrictions in confined confluent cell monolayers.

TI  - Sulfur and methane oxidation by a single microorganism.
PG  - e2114799119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2114799119 [doi]
AB  - Natural and anthropogenic wetlands are major sources of the atmosphericgreenhouse gas methane. Methane emissions from wetlands are mitigated bymethanotrophic bacteria at the oxic-anoxic interface, a zone of intense redoxcycling of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen compounds. Here, we report on theisolation of an aerobic methanotrophic bacterium, 'Methylovirgula thiovorans'strain HY1, which possesses metabolic capabilities never before found in anymethanotroph. Most notably, strain HY1 is the first bacterium shown toaerobically oxidize both methane and reduced sulfur compounds for growth. Genomicand proteomic analyses showed that soluble methane monooxygenase and XoxF-typealcohol dehydrogenases are responsible for methane and methanol oxidation,respectively. Various pathways for respiratory sulfur oxidation were present,including the Sox-rDsr pathway and the S4I system. Strain HY1 employed theCalvin-Benson-Bassham cycle for CO2 fixation during chemolithoautotrophic growth on reduced sulfur compounds. Proteomic and microrespirometry analyses showed thatthe metabolic pathways for methane and thiosulfate oxidation were induced in the presence of the respective substrates. Methane and thiosulfate could therefore beindependently or simultaneously oxidized. The discovery of this versatilebacterium demonstrates that methanotrophy and thiotrophy are compatible in asingle microorganism and underpins the intimate interactions of methane andsulfur cycles in oxic-anoxic interface environments.

AB  - Ruthenium (Ru) complexes are developed as latent emissive photosensitizers forcancer and pathogen photodiagnosis and therapy. Nevertheless, most existing Rucomplexes are limited as photosensitizers in terms of short excitation andemission wavelengths. Herein, we present an emissive Ru(II) metallacycle (herein referred to as 1) that is excited by 808-nm laser and emits at a wavelength ofapproximately 1,000 nm via coordination-driven self-assembly. Metallacycle 1exhibits good optical penetration ( approximately 7 mm) and satisfactory reactiveoxygen species production properties. Furthermore, 1 shows broad-spectrumantibacterial activity (including against drug-resistant Escherichia coli) aswell as low cytotoxicity to normal mammalian cells. In vivo studies reveal that 1is employed in precise, second near-infrared biomedical window fluorescentimaging-guided, photo-triggered treatments in Staphylococcus aureus-infected micemodels, with negligible side effects. This work thus broads the applications ofsupramolecular photosensitizers through the strategy of lengthening theirwavelengths.

AB  - A large number of neutrophils infiltrate the lymph node (LN) within 4 h afterStaphylococcus aureus skin infection (4 h postinfection [hpi]) and preventsystemic S. aureus dissemination. It is not clear how infection in the skin canremotely and effectively recruit neutrophils to the LN. Here, we found thatlymphatic vessel occlusion substantially reduced neutrophil recruitment to theLN. Lymphatic vessels effectively transported bacteria and proinflammatorychemokines (i.e., Chemokine [C-X-C motif] motif 1 [CXCL1] and CXCL2) to the LN.However, in the absence of lymph flow, S. aureus alone in the LN was insufficientto recruit neutrophils to the LN at 4 hpi. Instead, lymph flow facilitated theearliest neutrophil recruitment to the LN by delivering chemokines (i.e., CXCL1, CXCL2) from the site of infection. Lymphatic dysfunction is often found duringinflammation. During oxazolone (OX)-induced skin inflammation, CXCL1/2 in the LN was reduced after infection. The interrupted LN conduits further disrupted theflow of lymph and impeded its communication with high endothelial venules (HEVs),resulting in impaired neutrophil migration. The impaired neutrophil interactionwith bacteria contributed to persistent infection in the LN. Our studies showedthat both the flow of lymph from lymphatic vessels to the LN and the distributionof lymph in the LN are critical to ensure optimal neutrophil migration and timelyinnate immune protection in S. aureus infection.

TI  - Random encounters and amoeba locomotion drive the predation of Listeriamonocytogenes by Acanthamoeba castellanii.
PG  - e2122659119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2122659119 [doi]
AB  - Predatory protozoa play an essential role in shaping microbial populations. Amongthese protozoa, Acanthamoeba are ubiquitous in the soil and aqueous environments inhabited by Listeria monocytogenes. Observations of predator-prey interactionsbetween these two microorganisms revealed a predation strategy in whichAcanthamoeba castellanii assemble L. monocytogenes in aggregates, termedbackpacks, on their posterior. The rapid formation and specific location ofbackpacks led to the assumption that A. castellanii may recruit L. monocytogenes by releasing an attractant. However, this hypothesis has not been validated, and the mechanisms driving this process remained unknown. Here, we combined videomicroscopy, microfluidics, single-cell image analyses, and theoretical modelingto characterize predator-prey interactions of A. castellanii and L. monocytogenesand determined whether bacterial chemotaxis contributes to the backpackformation. Our results indicate that L. monocytogenes captures are not driven by chemotaxis. Instead, random encounters of bacteria with amoebae initializebacterial capture and aggregation. This is supported by the strong correlationbetween experimentally derived capture rates and theoretical encounter models at the single-cell level. Observations of the spatial rearrangement of L.monocytogenes trapped by A. castellanii revealed that bacterial aggregation into backpacks is mainly driven by amoeboid locomotion. Overall, we show that twononspecific, independent mechanisms, namely random encounters enhanced bybacterial motility and predator surface-bound locomotion, drive backpackformation, resulting in a bacterial aggregate on the amoeba ready forphagocytosis. Due to the prevalence of these two processes in the environment, weexpect this strategy to be widespread among amoebae, contributing to theireffectiveness as predators.

PG  - e2202590119
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2202590119 [doi]
AB  - CRISPR-associated transposons (CASTs) are Tn7-like elements that are capable ofRNA-guided DNA integration. Although structural data are known for nearly allcore transposition components, the transposase component, TnsB, remainsuncharacterized. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structuredetermination, we reveal the conformation of TnsB during transposon integrationfor the type V-K CAST system from Scytonema hofmanni (ShCAST). Our structure ofTnsB is a tetramer, revealing strong mechanistic relationships with the overallarchitecture of RNaseH transposases/integrases in general, and in particular the MuA transposase from bacteriophage Mu. However, key structural differences in theC-terminal domains indicate that TnsB's tetrameric architecture is stabilized by a different set of protein-protein interactions compared with MuA. We describethe base-specific interactions along the TnsB binding site, which explain howdifferent CAST elements can function on cognate mobile elements independent ofone another. We observe that melting of the 5' nontransferred strand of thetransposon end is a structural feature stabilized by TnsB and furthermore iscrucial for donor-DNA integration. Although not observed in the TnsBstrand-transfer complex, the C-terminal end of TnsB serves a crucial role intransposase recruitment to the target site. The C-terminal end of TnsB adopts ashort, structured 15-residue "hook" that decorates TnsC filaments. Unlikefull-length TnsB, C-terminal fragments do not appear to stimulate filamentdisassembly using two different assays, suggesting that additional interactionsbetween TnsB and TnsC are required for redistributing TnsC to appropriatetargets. The structural information presented here will help guide future work inmodifying these important systems as programmable gene integration tools.

AB  - During immune surveillance, CD8 T cells scan the surface of antigen-presentingcells using dynamic microvillar palpation and movements as well as by havingtheir receptors preconcentrated into patches. Here, we use real-time latticelight-sheet microscopy to demonstrate the independence of microvillar andmembrane receptor patch scanning. While T cell receptor (TCR) patches candistribute to microvilli, they do so stochastically and not preferentially as forother receptors such as CD62L. The distinctness of TCR patch movement frommicrovillar movement extends to many other receptors that form patches that also scan independent of the TCR. An exception to this is the CD8 coreceptor whichlargely comigrates in patches that overlap with or are closely adjacent to those containing TCRs. Microvilli that assemble into a synapse contain various arraysof the engaged patches, notably of TCRs and the inhibitory receptor PD-1,creating a pastiche of occupancies that vary from microvillar contact to contact.In summary, this work demonstrates that localization of receptor patches withinthe membrane and on microvillar projections is random prior to antigen detection and that such random variation may play into the generation of many individually composed receptor patch compositions at a single synapse.

AB  - A fundamental understanding of extracellular microenvironments of O2 and reactiveoxygen species (ROS) such as H2O2, ubiquitous in microbiology, demandshigh-throughput methods of mimicking, controlling, and perturbing gradients of O2and H2O2 at microscopic scale with high spatiotemporal precision. However, there is a paucity of high-throughput strategies of microenvironment design, and itremains challenging to achieve O2 and H2O2 heterogeneities with microbiologicallydesirable spatiotemporal resolutions. Here, we report the inverse design, basedon machine learning (ML), of electrochemically generated microscopic O2 and H2O2 profiles relevant for microbiology. Microwire arrays with suitably designedelectrochemical catalysts enable the independent control of O2 and H2O2 profiles with spatial resolution of approximately 10(1) mum and temporal resolution ofapproximately 10 degrees s. Neural networks aided by data augmentation inversely design the experimental conditions needed for targeted O2 and H2O2microenvironments while being two orders of magnitude faster than experimentalexplorations. Interfacing ML-based inverse design with electrochemicallycontrolled concentration heterogeneity creates a viable fast-response platformtoward better understanding the extracellular space with desirable spatiotemporalcontrol.

TI  - CWHM-12, an Antagonist of Integrin-Mediated Transforming Growth Factor-BetaActivation Confers Protection During Early Mycobacterium tuberculosis Infectionin Mice.
LID - 10.1089/jir.2022.0027 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) caused by the pathogenic bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis(Mtb) is one of the most lethal infectious diseases in the world. Presently,Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, the vaccine approved for use against TB, does not offercomplete protection against the disease, which necessitates the development ofnew therapeutics to treat this infection. Overexpression of transforming growthfactor beta (TGF-beta) is associated with pulmonary profibrotic changes. Theinactive TGF-beta secreted is activated through its cleavage and release byalphav integrins. Integrin-mediated regulation of TGF-beta is considered as amaster switch in the profibrotic process and a potential therapeutic target.Thus, in this study, we sought to determine if treatment with a broad rangeantagonist of integrins, CWHM-12, has the potency to inhibit pulmonary fibrosisand enhance Mtb control in a highly susceptible mouse model of Mtb infection,namely the C3Heb/FeJ (FeJ). CWHM-12 treatment at the early stages of Mtbinfection was efficacious in reducing disease severity and inflammationassociated with decreased iNOS, MIP-2, and IL-10 production without degradationof collagen. This suggests a potential for CWHM-12 targeting of TGF-beta to beexplored as an adjunct therapeutic for early Mtb infection.

TI  - SUMO Modification of Histone Demethylase KDM4A in Kaposi's Sarcoma-AssociatedHerpesvirus-Induced Primary Effusion Lymphoma.
PG  - e0075522
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00755-22 [doi]
AB  - Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a fatal B-cell lymphoma caused by Kaposi'ssarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. Inducing KSHV lytic replication that causes the death of host cells is an attractive treatment approach for PE;however, combination therapy inhibiting viral production is frequently needed to improve its outcomes. We have previously shown that the KSHV lytic protein K-bZIPcan SUMOylate histone lysine demethylase 4A (KDM4A) at lysine 471 (K471) and thisSUMOylation is required for virus production upon KSHV reactivation. Here, wedemonstrate that SUMOylation of KDM4A orchestrates PEL cell survival, a majorchallenge for the success of PEL treatment; and cell movement and angiogenesis,the cell functions contributing to PEL cell extravasation and dissemination.Furthermore, integrated ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses identified interleukin-10(IL-10), an immunosuppressive cytokine, as a novel downstream target of KDM4A. Wedemonstrate that PEL-induced angiogenesis is dependent on IL-10. Moreimportantly, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis demonstrated that,at the late stage of KSHV reactivation, KDM4A determines the fates of PEL cells, as evidenced by two distinct cell populations; one with less apoptotic signaling expresses high levels of viral genes and the other is exactly opposite, whileKDM4A-K417R-expressing cells contain only the apoptotic population with lessviral gene expression. Consistently, KDM4A knockout significantly reduced cellviability and virus production in KSHV-reactivated PEL cells. Since inhibitingPEL extravasation and eradicating KSHV-infected PEL cells without increasingviral load provide a strong rationale for treating PEL, this study indicatestargeting KDM4A as a promising therapeutic option for treating PEL. IMPORTANCEPEL is an aggressive and untreatable B-cell lymphoma caused by KSHV infection.Therefore, new therapeutic approaches for PEL need to be investigated. Sincesimultaneous induction of KSHV reactivation and apoptosis can directly kill PELcells, they have been applied in the treatment of this hematologic malignancy andhave made progress. Epigenetic therapy with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitorshas been proved to treat PEL. However, the antitumor efficacies of HDACinhibitors are modest and new approaches are needed. Following our previousreport showing that the histone lysine demethylase KDM4A and its SUMOylation are required for lytic reactivation of KSHV in PEL cells, we further investigated itscellular function. Here, we found that SUMOylation of KDM4A is required for thesurvival, movement, and angiogenesis of lytic KSHV-infected PEL cells. Togetherwith our previous finding showing the importance of KDM4A SUMOylation in viralproduction, KDM4A can be a potential therapeutic target for PEL.

TI  - Inhaled antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis.
PG  - CD008319
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD008319.pub4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder in which abnormal mucus in the lungs is associated with susceptibility to persistent infection. Pulmonaryexacerbations are when symptoms of infection become more severe. Antibiotics are an essential part of treatment for exacerbations and inhaled antibiotics may beused alone or in conjunction with oral antibiotics for milder exacerbations orwith intravenous antibiotics for more severe infections. Inhaled antibiotics donot cause the same adverse effects as intravenous antibiotics and may prove analternative in people with poor access to their veins. This is an update of apreviously published review. OBJECTIVES: To determine if treatment of pulmonaryexacerbations with inhaled antibiotics in people with cystic fibrosis improvestheir quality of life, reduces time off school or work, and improves theirlong-term lung function. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic FibrosisGroup's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register. Date of the last search: 7 March 2022.We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the Australia and New Zealand ClinicalTrials Registry and WHO ICTRP for relevant trials. Date of last search: 3 May2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials in people with cysticfibrosis with a pulmonary exacerbation in whom treatment with inhaled antibioticswas compared to placebo, standard treatment or another inhaled antibiotic forbetween one and four weeks. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authorsindependently selected eligible trials, assessed the risk of bias in each trialand extracted data. They assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADEcriteria. Authors of the included trials were contacted for more information.MAIN RESULTS: Five trials with 183 participants are included in the review. Twotrials (77 participants) compared inhaled antibiotics alone to intravenousantibiotics alone and three trials (106 participants) compared a combination ofinhaled and intravenous antibiotics to intravenous antibiotics alone. Trials wereheterogenous in design and two were only available in abstract form. Risk of biaswas difficult to assess in most trials but, for four out of five trials, wejudged there to be a high risk from lack of blinding and an unclear risk withregards to randomisation. Results were not fully reported and only limited datawere available for analysis. One trial was a cross-over design and we onlyincluded data from the first intervention arm. Inhaled antibiotics alone versusintravenous antibiotics alone Only one trial (18 participants) reported aperceived improvement in lifestyle (quality of life) in both groups (verylow-certainty evidence). Neither trial reported on time off work or school. Both trials measured lung function, but there was no difference reported betweentreatment groups (very low-certainty evidence). With regards to our secondaryoutcomes, one trial (18 participants) reported no difference in the need foradditional antibiotics and the second trial (59 participants) reported on thetime to next exacerbation. In neither case was a difference between treatmentsidentified (both very low-certainty evidence). The single trial (18 participants)measuring adverse events and sputum microbiology did not observe any in eithertreatment group for either outcome (very low-certainty evidence). Inhaledantibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics versus intravenous antibiotics aloneInhaled antibiotics plus intravenous antibiotics may make little or no differenceto quality of life compared to intravenous antibiotics alone. None of the trials reported time off work or school. All three trials measured lung function, butfound no difference between groups in forced expiratory volume in one second (twotrials; 44 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or vital capacity (onetrial; 62 participants). None of the trials reported on the need for additionalantibiotics. Inhaled plus intravenous antibiotics may make little difference tothe time to next exacerbation; however, one trial (28 participants) reported onhospital admissions and found no difference between groups. There is likely nodifference between groups in adverse events (very low-certainty evidence) and onetrial (62 participants) reported no difference in the emergence ofantibiotic-resistant organisms (very low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS'CONCLUSIONS: We identified only low- or very low-certainty evidence to judge the effectiveness of inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of pulmonary exacerbationsin people with cystic fibrosis. The included trials were not sufficiently poweredto achieve their goals. Hence, we are unable to demonstrate whether one treatmentwas superior to the other or not. Further research is needed to establish whetherinhaled tobramycin may be used as an alternative to intravenous tobramycin forsome pulmonary exacerbations.

TI  - Capsule type defines the capability of Klebsiella pneumoniae in evading Kupffercell capture in the liver.
PG  - e1010693
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010693 [doi]
AB  - Polysaccharide capsule is the main virulence factor of K. pneumoniae, a majorpathogen of bloodstream infections in humans. While more than 80 capsularserotypes have been identified in K. pneumoniae, only several serotypes arefrequently identified in invasive infections. It is documented that the capsuleenhances bacterial resistance to phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides andcomplement deposition under in vitro conditions. However, the precise role of thecapsule in the process of K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections remains to beelucidated. Here we show that the capsule promotes K. pneumoniae survival in the bloodstream by protecting bacteria from being captured by liver residentmacrophage Kupffer cells (KCs). Our real-time in vivo imaging revealed thatblood-borne acapsular K. pneumoniae mutant is rapidly captured and killed by KCs in the liver sinusoids of mice, whereas, to various extents, encapsulated strainsbypass the anti-bacterial machinery in a serotype-dependent manner. Using capsuleswitched strains, we show that certain high-virulence (HV) capsular serotypescompletely block KC's capture, whereas the low-virulence (LV) counterparts conferpartial protection against KC's capture. Moreover, KC's capture of the LV K.pneumoniae could be in vivo neutralized by free capsular polysaccharides ofhomologous but not heterologous serotypes, indicating that KCs specificallyrecognize the LV capsules. Finally, immunization with inactivated K. pneumoniaeenables KCs to capture the HV K. pneumoniae. Together, our findings haveuncovered that KCs are the major target cells of K. pneumoniae capsule to promotebacterial survival and virulence, which can be reversed by vaccination.

AB  - The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to adapt to its surroundingenvironment is critical for the bacterium to successfully colonize its host.Transcriptional changes are a vital mechanism by which Mtb responds to keyenvironmental signals experienced, such as pH, chloride (Cl-), nitric oxide (NO),and hypoxia. However, much remains unknown regarding how Mtb coordinates itsresponse to the disparate signals seen during infection. Utilizing atranscription factor (TF) overexpression plasmid library in combination with apH/Cl-responsive luciferase reporter, we identified the essential TF, PrrA, part of the PrrAB two-component system, as a TF involved in modulation of Mtb responseto pH and Cl-. Further studies revealed that PrrA also affected Mtb response toNO and hypoxia, with prrA overexpression dampening induction of NO andhypoxia-responsive genes. PrrA is phosphorylated not just by its cognate sensorhistidine kinase PrrB, but also by serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs) at a second distinct site. Strikingly, a STPK-phosphoablative PrrA variant wassignificantly dampened in its response to NO versus wild type Mtb, disrupted inits ability to adaptively enter a non-replicative state upon extended NOexposure, and attenuated for in vivo colonization. Together, our results revealPrrA as an important regulator of Mtb response to multiple environmental signals,and uncover a critical role of STPK regulation of PrrA in its function.

TI  - Microparticle Delivery of a STING Agonist Enables Indirect Activation of NK Cellsby Antigen-Presenting Cells.
LID - 10.1021/acs.molpharmaceut.2c00207 [doi]
AB  - Natural killer (NK) cells are an important member of the innate immune system andcan participate in direct tumor cell killing in response to immunotherapies. One class of immunotherapy is stimulator of interferon gene (STING) agonists, whichresult in a robust type I interferon (IFN-I) response. Most mechanistic studiesinvolving STING have focused on macrophages and T cells. Nevertheless, NK cellsare also activated by IFN-I, but the effect of STING activation on NK cellsremains to be adequately investigated. We show that both direct treatment withsoluble STING agonist cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate(cGAMP) and indirect treatment with cGAMP encapsulated in microparticles (MPs)result in NK cell activation in vitro, although the former requires 100x morecGAMP than the latter. Additionally, direct activation with cGAMP leads to NKcell death. Indirect activation with cGAMP MPs does not result in NK cell deathbut rather cell activation and cell killing in vitro. In vivo, treatment withsoluble cGAMP and cGAMP MPs both cause short-term activation, whereas only cGAMP MP treatment produces long-term changes in NK cell activation markers. Thus, thiswork indicates that treatment with an encapsulated STING agonist activates NKcells more efficiently than that with soluble cGAMP. In both the in vitro and in vivo systems, the MP delivery system results in more robust effects at a greatly reduced dosage. These results have potential applications in aiding theimprovement of cancer immunotherapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) remains one of the most significant causes of death and a major public health problem in the community.As a result, the aim of this study was to determine magnitude of Mycobacteriumtuberculosis, its drug resistance, and associated factors among presumptivetuberculosis (TB) patients at St. Paul's Hospital Millennium Medical College,Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: Cross-sectional study was conducted at St. Paul'sHospital Millennium Medical College (SPHMMC), Addis Ababa, Ethiopia from January to July 2019. Demographic and clinical data were collected by structuredquestionnaire through face to face interview. Using microscopic examination andGeneXpert MTB/RIF assay and culturing in the Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) culturemedia, we collected and analyzed both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary clinicalsamples. Data were analyzed by SPSS version 23. Binary logistic regression wasdone to identify the associated risk factors and p-value less than 0.05 was takenas significant association. RESULTS: Of the total 436 respondents, 223(51%) were male. The mean +/-SD age of the participants was 38+/-17years. Overall,27/436(6.2%) of the participants had confirmed Mycobacterium tuberculosis usingthe GeneXpert MTB/RIF assay and LJ culture media, and two isolates were resistantto RIF and one to INH medication, with two (0.5%) being MDR-TB. MTB infection wasassociated with previous TB contact history, patient weight loss, and CD4+ T-cellcounts of 200-350/mm3 of blood. CONCLUSION: The magnitude of M. tuberculosis and MDR-TB in this study underscores the need for improved early case detection andmanagement of MDR-TB in order to reduce transmission and patient suffering.

TI  - Structural and biophysical properties of FopA, a major outer membrane protein of Francisella tularensis.
PG  - e0267370
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0267370 [doi]
AB  - Francisella tularensis is an extremely infectious pathogen and a category Abioterrorism agent. It causes the highly contagious zoonosis, Tularemia.Currently, FDA approved vaccines against tularemia are unavailable. F. tularensisouter membrane protein A (FopA) is a well-studied virulence determinant andprotective antigen against tularemia. It is a major outer membrane protein (Omp) of F. tularensis. However, FopA-based therapeutic intervention is hindered due tolack of complete structural information for membrane localized mature FopA. Inour study, we established recombinant expression, monodisperse purification,crystallization and X-ray diffraction (~6.5 A) of membrane localized mature FopA.Further, we performed bioinformatics and biophysical experiments to unveil itsstructural organization in the outer membrane. FopA consists of 393 amino acidsand has less than 40% sequence identity to known bacterial Omps. Usingcomprehensive sequence alignments and structure predictions together withexisting partial structural information, we propose a two-domain organization forFopA. Circular dichroism spectroscopy and heat modifiability assay confirmed FopAhas a beta-barrel domain consistent with alphafold2's prediction of an eightstranded beta-barrel at the N-terminus. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) andnative-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed FopA purified in detergentmicelles is predominantly dimeric. Molecular density derived from SAXS at 31 Ashows putative dimeric N-terminal beta-barrels surrounded by detergent corona andconnected to C-terminal domains via flexible linker. Disorder analysis predictsN- and C-terminal domains are interspersed by a long intrinsically disorderedregion and alphafold2 predicts this region to be largely unstructured. Takentogether, we propose a dimeric, two-domain organization of FopA in the outermembrane: the N-terminal beta-barrel is membrane embedded, provides dimerization interface and tethers to membrane extrinsic C-terminal domain via long flexiblelinker. Structure determination of membrane localized mature FopA is essential tounderstand its role in pathogenesis and develop anti-tularemia therapeutics. Our results pave the way towards it.

PG  - e0272375
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272375 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence around prevalence of bacterial coinfection and pattern ofantibiotic use in COVID-19 is controversial although high prevalence rates ofbacterial coinfection have been reported in previous similar global viralrespiratory pandemics. Early data on the prevalence of antibiotic prescribing in COVID-19 indicates conflicting low and high prevalence of antibiotic prescribing which challenges antimicrobial stewardship programmes and increases risk ofantimicrobial resistance (AMR). AIM: To determine current prevalence of bacterialcoinfection and antibiotic prescribing in COVID-19 patients. DATA SOURCE: OVIDMEDLINE, OVID EMBASE, Cochrane and MedRxiv between January 2020 and June 2021.STUDY ELIGIBILITY: English language studies of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19patients which reported (a) prevalence of bacterial coinfection and/or (b)prevalence of antibiotic prescribing with no restrictions to study designs orhealthcare setting. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (aged >/= 18 years) with RT-PCRconfirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, regardless of study setting. METHODS: Systematicreview and meta-analysis. Proportion (prevalence) data was pooled using randomeffects meta-analysis approach; and stratified based on region and study design. RESULTS: A total of 1058 studies were screened, of which 22, hospital-basedstudies were eligible, compromising 76,176 of COVID-19 patients. Pooled estimatesfor the prevalence of bacterial co-infection and antibiotic use were 5.62% (95%CI 2.26-10.31) and 61.77% (CI 50.95-70.90), respectively. Sub-group analysis byregion demonstrated that bacterial co-infection was more prevalent in NorthAmerican studies (7.89%, 95% CI 3.30-14.18). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of bacterial coinfection in COVID-19 is low, yet prevalence of antibiotic prescribing is high,indicating the need for targeted COVID-19 antimicrobial stewardship initiativesto reduce the global threat of AMR.

AB  - Armillaria mellea is an important fungal pathogen worldwide, affecting a largenumber of hosts in the horticulture and forestry industries. Controlling A.mellea infection is expensive, labour intensive and time-consuming, so a new,environmentally friendly management solution is required. To this effect,endophytic Trichoderma species were studied as a potential protective agent forArmillaria root rot (ARR) in strawberry and privet plants. A collection of forty endophytic Trichoderma isolates were inoculated into strawberry (Fragaria xananassa) plants and plant growth was monitored for two months, during which timeTrichoderma treatment had no apparent effect. Trichoderma-colonised strawberryplants were then inoculated with A. mellea and after three months plants wereassessed for A. mellea infection. There was considerable variation in ARR diseaselevels between plants inoculated with different Trichoderma spp. isolates, butseven isolates reduced ARR below the level of positive controls. These isolateswere further tested for protective potential in Trichoderma-colonized privet(Ligustrum vulgare) plants where five Trichoderma spp. isolates, including twohighly effective Trichoderma atrobrunneum isolates, were able to significantlyreduce levels of disease. This study highlights the potential of plantspre-colonised with T. atrobrunneum for effective protection against A. mellea in two hosts from different plant families.

AB  - Non-typhoidal Salmonellae are common foodborne pathogens that can causegastroenteritis and other illnesses in people. This is the first study to assess the transfer of Salmonella enterica from raw chicken carcasses to ready-to-eatchicken salad in Cambodia. Twelve focus group discussions in four Cambodianprovinces collected information on typical household ways of preparing salad. Theresults informed four laboratory experiments that mimicked household practices,using chicken carcasses inoculated with Salmonella. We developed four scenariosencompassing the range of practices, varying by order of washing (chicken orvegetables first) and change of chopping utensils (same utensils or different).Even though raw carcasses were washed twice, Salmonella was isolated from 32 out of 36 chicken samples (88.9%, 95% CI: 73.0-96.4) and two out of 18 vegetablesamples (11.1%, 95% CI: 1.9-36.1). Salmonella was detected on cutting boards(66.7%), knives (50.0%) and hands (22.2%) after one wash; cross-contamination wassignificantly higher on cutting boards than on knives or hands (p-value < 0.05). The ready-to-eat chicken salad was contaminated in scenario 1 (wash vegetablesfirst, use same utensils), 2 (wash vegetables first, use different utensils) and 3 (wash chicken first, use same utensils) but not 4 (wash chicken first, usedifferent utensils) (77.8%, 11.1%, 22.2% and 0%, respectively). There wassignificantly higher Salmonella cross-contamination in scenario 1 (washvegetables first, use same utensils) than in the other three scenarios. Theseresults show how different hygiene practices influence the risk of pathogenscontaminating chicken salad. This information could decrease the risk offoodborne disease in Cambodia and provides inputs to a quantitative riskassessment model.

AB  - In spite of the availability of vaccine, the health burden associated with theCOVID-19 pandemic continues to increase. An estimated 5 million people have died with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Analysis of evolution and genomic diversity canprovide sufficient information to reduce the health burden of the pandemic. This study focused to conduct worldwide genomic surveillance. About 7.6 milliongenomic data were analyzed during 2019 to 2022. Multiple sequence alignment wasconducted by using maximum likelihood method. Clade GK (52%) was the mostpredominant followed by GRY (12%), GRA (11%), GR (8%), GH (7%), G (6%), GV (3%), and O (1%), respectively. VOC Delta (66%) was the most prevalent variant followedby VOC Alpha (18%), VOC Omicron (13%), VOC Gamma (2%) and VOC Beta (1%),respectively. The frequency of point mutations including E484K, N501Y, N439K, andL452R at spike protein has increased 10%-92%. Evolutionary rate of the variantswas 23.7 substitution per site per year. Substitution mutations E484K and N501Yhad significant correlation with cases (r = .45, r = .23), fatalities (r = .15, r= .44) and growth rate R0 (r = .28, r = .54). This study will help to understand the genomic diversity, evolution and the impact of the variants on the outcome ofthe COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The filling mining method is an effective method for controlling ground stressand preventing surface subsidence in the mining field during exploitation ofunderground resources. Tailings can be utilized as the filling material, so as torealize the reuse of industrial waste. However, utilization of the traditionalPortland cement as the cementing material for tailings leads to groundwaterpollution. In addition, production of Portland cement results in consumption of agreat amount of ore and air pollution. In this paper, a tailings cementationmethod by using the microbial induced calcite precipitation (MICP) technique withimmersion curing is proposed. Tailings are cemented by the MICP technique withaerobic bacteria (Sporosarcina pasteurii) under a soaked curing environment. The variable control method is applied to investigate the factors influencing thecementation effects by the MICP technique with Sporosarcina pasteurii, including the bacterial solution concentration, the cementing solution concentration, theparticle size of tailings, and the curing temperature. The results indicate that:when OD600 of the Sporosarcina pasteurii solution is 1.6, the urea concentration in the cementing solution is 0.75 mol/L, the tailings are raw materials withoutgrinding, and the curing temperature is 30 degrees C, the cementation effect isthe best. In view of uneven calcification during MICP with Sporosarcinapasteurii, mixed Sporosarcina pasteurii and Castellaniella denitrificans are usedfor tailings cementation. Higher strength of cemented tailings is achieved. It isproved that the MICP technique with mixed aerobic bacteria and facultativeanaerobes is an effective method for tailings cementation.

PG  - e0272388
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0272388 [doi]
AB  - Stenotrophomonas maltophilia contains an operon comprising mfsB and mfsC, whichencode membrane transporters in the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). Theresults of the topological analysis predicted that both MfsB and MfsC possess 12 transmembrane helices with the N- and C-termini located inside the cells. Thedeletion of mfsC increased the susceptibility to diamide, a chemical oxidizingagent, but not to antibiotics and oxidative stress-generating substances relativeto wild-type K279a. Moreover, no altered phenotype was observed against alltested substances for the DeltamfsB mutant. The results of the expressionanalysis revealed that the mfsBC expression was significantly induced by exposureto diamide. The diamide-induced gene expression was mediated by DitR, a TetR-typetranscriptional regulator encoded by smlt0547. A constitutively high expressionof mfsC in the ditR mutant indicated that DitR acts as a transcriptionalrepressor of mfsBC under physiological conditions. Purified DitR was bound tothree sites spanning from position + 21 to -57, corresponding to the putativemfsBC promoter sequence, thereby interfering with the binding of RNA polymerase. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assays illustrated that thetreatment of purified DitR with diamide caused the release of DitR from the mfsBCpromoter region, and the diamide sensing mechanism of DitR required two conservedcysteine residues, Cys92 and Cys127. This suggests that exposure to diamide canoxidize DitR through the oxidation of cysteine residues, leading to its releasefrom the promoter, thus allowing mfsBC transcription. Overall, MfsC and DitR playa role in adaptive resistance against the diamide of S. maltophilia.

LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270187 [doi]
AB  - While most productivity on the surface of the Earth today is fueled by oxygenicphotosynthesis, for much of Earth history it is thought that anoxygenicphotosynthesis-using compounds like ferrous iron or sulfide as electrondonors-drove most global carbon fixation. Anoxygenic photosynthesis is stillperformed by diverse bacteria in niche environments today. Of these, the Chlorobi(formerly green sulfur bacteria) are often interpreted as being particularlyancient and are frequently proposed to have fueled the biosphere during lateArchean and early Paleoproterozoic time before the rise of oxygenicphotosynthesis. Here, we perform comparative genomic, phylogenetic, and molecularclock analyses to determine the antiquity of the Chlorobi and theircharacteristic phenotypes. We show that contrary to common assumptions, theChlorobi clade is relatively young, with anoxygenic phototrophy, carbon fixation via the rTCA pathway, and iron oxidation all significantly postdating the rise ofoxygen ~2.3 billion years ago. The Chlorobi therefore could not have fueled theArchean biosphere, but instead represent a relatively young radiation oforganisms which likely acquired the capacity for anoxygenic photosynthesis andother traits via horizontal gene transfer sometime after the evolution ofoxygenic Cyanobacteria.

TI  - Intracranially Extended Sinonasal Undifferentiated Carcinoma: A Case Report andLiterature Review.
PG  - e935876
LID - 10.12659/AJCR.935876 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas (SNUC) are highly malignant and rare lesions. Therapeutic efforts often provide frustrating results. Their courseis characterized by indolent progression, until it culminates in extensive local infiltration of adjacent anatomical structures or cervical lymphadenopathy inapproximately one-third of patients upon admission. It most frequently affectsmales, with a sex ratio of 3: 1. The age at manifestation tends to be about 40-50years. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 41-year-old man with intracranialexpansion of SNUC. Two previous sinus surgeries were performed endoscopicallybecause the lesion at that moment was exclusively located endonasally. Within thelast few months, he had been having persistent headaches. Magnetic resonanceimaging (MRI) revealed an anterior cranial fossa lesion. Therefore, he underwent a bifrontal craniotomy and excision of the space-occupying lesion (SOL). Theosseous defect of the skull base was covered with a titanium mesh. Finally, weperformed a duraplasty using a pericranial flap and fat tissue taken from hisabdomen. Postoperatively, his wound was dehisced. We proceeded then to a frontal craniectomy with surgical debridement, subgaleal empyem and epidural abscessremoval, and copious irrigation with oxygen peroxide. Enterococcus spp. wereisolated from pus cultures. Despite receiving bacteria-focused antibiotics, heunfortunately developed sepsis and died. The histopathologic findings revealed a SNUC, which is the criterion standard for diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Multimodaltreatment offers the best prognosis to patients with SNUC. Combined operations byotolaryngologists and neurosurgeons provide the necessary radicality. There ishigh risk of wound healing disorders, especially when local irradiation had been administered.

LID - 10.20900/agmr20220004 [doi]
AB  - Advanced age escalates post-burn complications and older burn patients, and even those with relatively minor burns, have worse clinical outcomes after injury.While the mechanism(s) responsible for the compounding effects of age and burninjury have not been defined, in this viewpoint, we highlight the emerging datasuggesting that age-mediated impairment of gut barrier integrity and dysbiosis ofthe fecal microbiome in older subjects may play a role in the heightenedmulti-organ responses seen in older patients. Studies aimed at exploring thecontribution of intestinal dysfunction in age-related exacerbations of post-burn inflammatory responses could highlight novel therapeutic interventions that canbe used to treat victims of burns and other traumatic injuries.

TI  - Genome-based reclassification of Azospirillum brasilense Az39 as the type strain of Azospirillum argentinense sp. nov.
LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.005475 [doi]
AB  - Strain Az39(T) of Azospirillum is a diazotrophic plant growth-promoting bacteriumisolated in 1982 from the roots of wheat plants growing in Marcos Juarez,Cordoba, Argentina. It produces indole-3-acetic acid in the presence ofl-tryptophan as a precursor, grows at 20-38 degrees C (optimal 38 degrees C), andthe cells are curved or spiral-shaped, with diameters ranging from 0.5-0.9 to1.8-2.2 microm. They contain C16 : 0, C18 : 0 and C18 : 1 omega7c/omega6c as the main fatty acids. Phylogenetic analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence confirmedthat this strain belongs to the genus Azospirillum, showing a close relationship with Azospirillum baldaniorum Sp245(T), Azospirillum brasilense Sp7(T) andAzospirillum formosense CC-Nfb-7(T). Housekeeping gene analysis revealed thatAz39(T), together with five strains of the genus (Az19, REC3, BR 11975, MTCC4035 and MTCC4036), form a cluster apart from A. baldaniorum Sp245(T), A. brasilenseSp7(T) and A. formosense CC-Nfb-7(T). Average nucleotide identity (ANI) anddigital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) between Az39(T) and the aforementioned type strains revealed values below 96 %, the circumscription limit for the speciesdelineation (ANI: 95.3, 94.1 and 94.0 %; dDDH: 62.9, 56.3 and 55.6 %).Furthermore, a phylogeny evaluation of the core proteome, including 809 commonshared proteins, showed an independent grouping of Az39(T), Az19, REC3, BR 11975,MTCC4035 and MTCC4036. The G+C content in the genomic DNA of these six strainsvaried from 68.3 to 68.5 %. Based on the combined phylogenetic, genomic andphenotypic characterization presented here, we consider that strain Az39(T),along with strains Az19, REC3, BR 11975, MTCC4035 and MTCC4036, are members of a new Azospirillum species, for which the name Azospirillum argentinense sp. nov.is proposed. The type strain is Az39(T) (=LBPCV39(T)=BR 148428(T)=CCCT 22.01(T)).

TI  - Reinstatement and phylogenetic allocation of the palm rust genus Cerradoa in the Pucciniaceae, and establishment of Pseudocerradoa, gen. nov.
PG  - 1-19
LID - 10.1080/00275514.2022.2084672 [doi]
AB  - The genus Cerradoa (type species Cerradoa palmaea) was established in 1978 byHennen and Ono and named after the Brazilian Cerrado biome. The holotypecollected in Planaltina, Federal District, Brazil, belonged to the first rustfungus reported on palms (Arecaceae). For decades, the status of Cerradoa as adistinct genus has been regarded as doubtful, representing a synonym of Edythea(Uropyxidaceae) starting with the second edition of the Illustrated Genera ofRust Fungi in 1983. Our molecular phylogenetic analyses, as well as ourmorphological investigations, allowed us to reject this synonymy, leading to the reinstatement of Cerradoa within the Pucciniaceae. Cerradoa, together withmorphologically similar genera such as the newly established Pseudocerradoa with two species (Ps. paullula and Ps. rhaphidophorae) infecting araceous hosts, thefern rust Desmella, and also P. engleriana, could not be assigned to any of theseven identified major lineages within the Pucciniaceae. Edythea, instead ofbeing maintained as a member of the Uropyxidaceae, was herein placed inPucciniaceae, shown phylogenetically in close relationship to Cumminsiellamirabilissima, both infecting the Berberidaceae. Additionally, our extensivephylogenetic analyses add guidance for future taxonomic revisions in the highlypolyphyletic genus Puccinia and other established taxa within the familyPucciniaceae.

LID - dkac256 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jac/dkac256 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Remdesivir and sotrovimab both have clinical trial data in theoutpatient setting demonstrating reduction in the risk of hospitalizations andemergency department (ED) visits related to COVID-19. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate theeffectiveness of remdesivir in comparison with sotrovimab and matched high-riskcontrol patients in preventing COVID-19-related hospitalizations and ED visitsduring the Omicron B.1.1.529 surge. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospectivecohort study included outpatients positive for SARS-CoV-2, with non-severesymptoms for </=7 days and deemed high-risk for severe COVID-19 by an internalscoring matrix. Patients who received remdesivir or sotrovimab from 27/12/2021 to04/02/2022 were included (n = 82 and n = 88, respectively). These were comparedwith a control cohort of high-risk COVID-19 outpatients who did not receivetherapy (n = 90). The primary outcome was a composite of 29 day COVID-19-related hospitalizations and/or ED visits. Pre-specified secondary outcomes includedcomponents of the primary endpoint, 29 day all-cause mortality and seriousadverse drug events. RESULTS: Patients treated with remdesivir were significantlyless likely to be hospitalized or visit the ED within 29 days from symptom onset (11% versus 23.3%; OR = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.17-0.95). Patients receiving sotrovimab were also less likely to be hospitalized or visit the ED (8% versus 23.3%; OR =0.28, 95% CI = 0.11-0.71). There was no difference in the incidence ofhospitalizations/ED visits between sotrovimab and remdesivir. CONCLUSIONS: Ourhighest-risk outpatients with Omicron-related COVID-19 who received earlysotrovimab or remdesivir had significantly lower likelihoods of a hospitalizationand/or ED visit.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a delay differential equation model to describe theWolbachia infection dynamics in mosquitoes in which the key factor of cytoplasmicincompactibility (CI) is incorporated in a more natural way than those in theliterature. By analyzing the dynamics of the model, we are able to obtain someinformation on the impact of four important parameters: the competitioncapabilities of the wild mosquitoes and infected mosquitoes, the maternaltransmission level and the CI level. The analytic results show that there areranges of parameters that support competition exclusion principle, and there are also ranges of parameters that allow co-persistence for both wild and infectedmosquitoes. These ranges account for the scenarios of failure of invasion,invasion and suppressing the wild mosquitoes, and invasion and replacing the wildmosquitoes. We also discuss some possible future problems both in mathematics andin modeling.

TI  - Effects of multiple halotolerant rhizobacteria on the tolerance, growth, andyield of rice plants under salt stress.
LID - 10.1007/s12223-022-00997-y [doi]
AB  - Halotolerant bacteria get adapted to a saline environment through modifiedphysiological/structural characteristics and may provide stress tolerance alongwith enhanced growth to the host plants by different direct and indirectmechanisms. This study reports on multiple halotolerant plant growth-promotingrhizobacteria isolated from the coastal soils in Bangladesh, in fields where the halophytic wild rice Oryza coarctata is endemic. The aim was to find halotolerantbacteria for potential use as biofertilizer under normal/salt-stressedconditions. In this study, eight different strains were selected from a total of 20 rhizobacterial isolates from the saline-prone regions of Debhata and Satkhira based on their higher salt tolerance. 16S rRNA gene sequencing results of therhizobacterial strains revealed that they belonged to Halobacillus, Bacillus,Acinetobactor, and Enterobactor genera. A total of ten halotolerant rhizobacteria(the other 2 bacteria were previously isolated and already reported as beneficialfor rice growth) were used as both single inoculants and in combinations andapplied to rice growing in pots. To investigate their capability to improve rice growth, physiological parameters such as shoot and root length and weight,chlorophyll content at the seedling stage as well as survival and yield at thereproductive stage were measured in the absence or presence (in concentration 40 or 80 mmol/L) of NaCl and in the absence or presence of the rhizobacteria. At thereproductive stage, only 50% of the uninoculated plants survived without setting any grains in 80 mmol/L NaCl in contrast to 100% survival of the rice plantsinoculated with a combination of the rhizobacteria. The combined halotolerantrhizobacterial inoculations showed significantly higher chlorophyll retention as well as yield under the maximum NaCl concentration applied compared toapplication of single species. Thus, the use of a combination of halotolerantrhizobacteria as bioinoculants for rice plants under moderate salinity cansynergistically alleviate the effects of stress and promote rice growth andyield.

LID - 10.1007/s00018-022-04489-7 [doi]
AB  - The human pathogen Helicobacter pylori represents a risk factor for thedevelopment of gastric diseases including cancer. The H. pylori-inducedtranscription factor nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated Bcells (NF-kappaB) is involved in the pro-inflammatory response and cell survival in the gastric mucosa, and represents a trailblazer of gastric pathophysiology.Termination of nuclear NF-kappaB heterodimer RelA/p50 activity is regulated bythe ubiquitin-RING-ligase complex elongin-cullin-suppressor of cytokinesignalling 1 (ECS(SOCS1)), which leads to K48-ubiquitinylation and degradation ofRelA. We found that deubiquitinylase (DUB) ubiquitin specific protease 48(USP48), which interacts with the COP9 signalosome (CSN) subunit CSN1, stabilisesRelA by deubiquitinylation and thereby promotes the transcriptional activity ofRelA to prolong de novo synthesis of DUB A20 in H. pylori infection. An importantrole of A20 is the suppression of caspase-8 activity and apoptotic cell death.USP48 thus enhances the activity of A20 to reduce apoptotic cell death in cellsinfected with H. pylori. Our results, therefore, define a synergistic mechanismby which USP48 and A20 regulate RelA and apoptotic cell death in H. pyloriinfection.

TI  - Does the use of intrawound povidone-iodine irrigation and local vancomycin powderimpact surgical site infection rate in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis surgery?
LID - 10.1007/s00586-022-07340-6 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Surgical site infection (SSI) is a major complication after adolescentidiopathic scoliosis (AIS) surgery, with an incidence ranging from 0.5 to 7%.Intraoperative wound decontamination with povidone-iodine (PVP-I) irrigationand/or vancomycin powder in adult spinal surgery has gained attention in theliterature with controversial results. The aim of this study was to investigatethe impact of using intrawound PVP-I irrigation and local vancomycin powder (LVP)on the incidence of early SSI in AIS surgery. METHODS: All AIS patients whounderwent posterior spinal fusion between October 2016 and December 2019 wereretrospectively reviewed. The incidence of early SSI was reported and comparedbetween 2 groups defined by the treating spinal surgeons' preferences: group1-intrawound irrigation with 2L of PVP-I and application of 3 g LVP beforeclosure and control group 2-patients that did not receive either of thesemeasures. RESULTS: Nine early cases of SSI (2.9%) were reported among the 307 AISposterior spinal fusion patients. Incidence of SSI in group 1 (2/178 = 1.1%) was significantly lower than in group 2 (7/129 = 5.4%; p = 0.04). There were noadverse reactions to the use of PVP-I and LVP in our study. At latest follow-up, rate of surgical revision for mechanical failure with pseudarthrosis wassignificantly lower in group 1 (2/178 = 1.1%) than in group 2 (9/129 = 7.0%; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative use of intrawound PVP-I irrigation andvancomycin powder is associated with a significant reduction of early SSI afterAIS spine surgery.

TI  - Nectar-Inhabiting Bacteria Affect Olfactory Responses of an Insect Parasitoid by Altering Nectar Odors.
LID - 10.1007/s00248-022-02078-6 [doi]
AB  - Floral nectar is ubiquitously colonized by a variety of microorganisms amongwhich yeasts and bacteria are the most common. Microorganisms inhabiting floralnectar can alter several nectar traits, including nectar odor by producingmicrobial volatile organic compounds (mVOCs). Evidence showing that mVOCs canaffect the foraging behavior of insect pollinators is increasing in theliterature, whereas the role of mVOCs in altering the foraging behavior ofthird-trophic level organisms such as insect parasitoids is largely overlooked.Parasitoids are frequent visitors of flowers and are well known to feed onnectar. In this study, we isolated bacteria inhabiting floral nectar ofbuckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum (Polygonales: Polygonaceae), to test thehypothesis that nectar bacteria affect the foraging behavior of the eggparasitoid Trissolcus basalis (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) via changes in odors of nectar. In behavioral assays, we found that T. basalis wasps are attracted towardnectar fermented by 4 out of the 14 bacterial strains isolated, which belong toStaphylococcus epidermidis, Terrabacillus saccharophilus (both Firmicutes),Pantoea sp. (Proteobacteria), and Curtobacterium sp. (Actinobacteria). Results ofchemical investigations revealed significant differences in the volatile blendcomposition of nectars fermented by the bacterial isolates. Our results indicate that nectar-inhabiting bacteria play an important role in the interactionsbetween flowering plants and foraging parasitoids. These results are alsorelevant from an applied perspective as flowering resources, such as buckwheat,are largely used in agriculture to promote conservation biological control ofinsect pests.

LID - 10.1007/s00063-022-00925-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria are threateningmodern healthcare, and antibacterial resistance has become one of the greatestthreats to public health. In Germany 54,500 patients become infected withantibiotic-resistant bacteria per year, causing about 2400 attributable deaths.Rising resistance in Gram-negative bacteria especially carbapenem-resistantpathogens is of particular concern due to the lack of effective and safealternative treatment options. OBJECTIVE: The results from trials andcompassionate-use programs with the new antibiotic cefiderocol, which wasapproved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in April 2020 for the treatmentof adults with infections caused by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, aresummarized. RESULTS: The new betalactam antibiotic cefiderocol is the firstsiderophore cephalosporin indicated for the treatment of infections due toaerobic Gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. Itschemical structure and its unique mechanism of action confer enhanced stabilityagainst betalactamases including all classes of clinically relevantcarbapenemases. In vitro data show high antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacterales and nonfermenters, includingcarbapenem-resistant strains. In clinical trials, cefiderocol showed superiority in complicated urinary tract infection in comparison to imipenem andnon-inferiority versus meropenem in hospital-acquired/ventilator-associatedpneumonia patients and severe infections caused by carbapenem-resistantpathogens. CONCLUSION: Clinical trial data and case reports identified in theliterature search show that cefiderocol is a promising treatment option forsevere infections caused by drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, particularlycarbapenem-resistant bacteria.

TI  - Complete gammaproteobacterial endosymbiont genome assembly from a seep tubewormLamellibrachia satsuma.
LID - 10.1007/s12275-022-2057-4 [doi]
AB  - Siboglinid tubeworms thrive in hydrothermal vent and seep habitats via asymbiotic relationship with chemosynthetic bacteria. Difficulties in culturingtubeworms and their symbionts in a laboratory setting have hindered the study of host-microbe interactions. Therefore, released symbiont genomes are fragmented,thereby limiting the data available on the genome that affect subsequentanalyses. Here, we present a complete genome of gammaproteobacterial endosymbiontfrom the tubeworm Lamellibrachia satsuma collected from a seep in Kagoshima Bay, assembled using a hybrid approach that combines sequences generated from theIllumina and Oxford Nano-pore platforms. The genome consists of a single circularchromosome with an assembly size of 4,323,754 bp and a GC content of 53.9% with3,624 protein-coding genes. The genome is of high quality and contains noassembly gaps, while the completeness and contamination are 99.33% and 2.73%,respectively. Comparative genome analysis revealed a total of 1,724 gene clustersshared in the vent and seep tubeworm symbionts, while 294 genes were foundexclusively in L. satsuma symbionts such as transposons, genes for defensemechanisms, and inorganic ion transportations. The addition of this completeendosymbiont genome assembly would be valuable for comparative studiesparticularly with tubeworm symbiont genomes as well as with other chemosynthetic microbial communities.

AB  - This study was designed to evaluate the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and cytotoxicpotentials of the marine actinomycetes spp. isolated from the Red Sea water,Hurghada, Egypt. Out of 80 actinomycetes isolates, one isolate AW6 was selectedbased on its antioxidant activity (IC50 about 5.24 microg/mL which scavenged 91% of formed DPPH free radicals) and antimicrobial potential against E. coli, S.aureus, B. subtilis, and P. aeruginosa, A. niger, and C. albicans. The strain wasidentified based on phenotypic and genotypic analysis, and deposited in theGenBank with accession number OK090864.1. Cultivation of the selected strain onrice, chromatographic purification, and structural elucidation led to theisolation of two compounds C1: umbelliferone, and C2:1-methoxy-3-methyl-8-hydroxy-anthraquinone. The antimicrobial activity of theobtained compounds showed that C1 and C2 have low antibacterial activity towardS. aureus and E. coli with no pronounced activity toward P. aeruginosa, C.albicans, and A. niger. Additionally, the antioxidant activity of C1 and C2revealed that C2 has a good antioxidant activity, with DPPH scavenging activityreaching (55.25%), followed by C1 (30.20%). Moreover, both compounds displayedanti-Gyr-B enzyme activity with IC50 value of (3.79 +/- 0.21 microM) for C1, and (IC50 = 13 +/- 0.71 microM) for C2. The ADME-related physicochemical propertiesof the obtained compound were predicted using SwissADME web tools and theProToxii webserver was used to estimate in silico toxicity.

TI  - Concise evaluation and therapeutic guidelines for severe periodontitis: A public health perspective.
LID - 10.1111/prd.12463 [doi]
AB  - The main goal of periodontology is to prevent and arrest gingivitis andperiodontitis to avoid tooth loss and focal infection of periodontal origin.Periodontal scaling or flap surgery of moderate-to-severe periodontitis haveshortcomings, most likely because removal of herpesviruses and bacterialpathogens in deep periodontal lesions and the adjacent inflamed gingiva requires systemic antimicrobial treatment (or gingivectomy). Valacyclovir (1000 mg twicedaily on day 1, and 500 mg twice daily on day 2 and on day 3) is a potentanti-herpesvirus agent. Antibiotic combinations against bacterial pathogensinclude amoxicillin-metronidazole (250 mg of each, thrice daily for 4 days; forsystemically healthy adults) and ciprofloxacin-metronidazole (500 mg of each,twice daily for 4 days; for immunosuppressed individuals and patients exposed to contaminated water and poor sanitation). Supportive antiseptic treatment mayconsist of 0.1%-0.2% sodium hypochlorite (regular household bleach) as coolingspray in ultrasonic scalers, flosser fluid in oral irrigators, and mouthrinse in patient self-care. The anti-infective treatment described here helps controlcases of severe periodontitis and constitutes an exceedingly inexpensivealternative to conventional (mechanical) periodontal therapy.

TI  - Aminoglycoside-mimicking carbonized polymer dots for bacteremia treatment.
LID - 10.1039/d2nr01959k [doi]
AB  - Bacteremia and associated bacterial sepsis are potentially fatal and occur whenthe host response to microbial invasion is impaired or compromised. Thismotivated us to develop carbonized polymer dots (CPDsMan/AA) from a mixture ofmannose (Man) and positively charged amino acids [AAs; lysine, arginine (Arg), orhistidine] through a one-step mild pyrolysis procedure, which effectivelyinhibited drug-resistant bacterial strains isolated from septic patients. Theas-prepared CPDsMan/AA showed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, includingmultidrug-resistant bacteria, even in human plasma. The minimal inhibitoryconcentration of CPDsMan/Arg is ca. 1.0 mug mL(-1), which is comparable to orlower than those of other tested antibiotics (e.g., ampicillin, gentamicin, andvancomycin). In addition to directly disrupting bacterial membranes, theCPDsMan/Arg feature a structure similar to aminoglycoside antibiotics that could bind to 16S rRNA, thereby blocking bacterial protein synthesis. In vitrocytotoxic and hemolytic assays demonstrated the high biocompatibility of theCPDsMan/AA. In addition, in vivo studies on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus-infected mice treated with the CPDsMan/Arg showed a significant decreasein mortality-even better than that of antibiotics. Overall, the synthesis of the CPDsMan/AA is cost-efficient, straightforward, and effective for treatingbacteremia. The polymeric features of the CPDsMan/Arg, including cationic chargesand specific groups, can be recognized as a safe and broad-spectrum biocide tolessen our reliance on antibiotics to treat systemic bacterial infections in the future.

TI  - The Biochemical Mechanisms of Antimicrobial Photodynamic Therapy.
LID - 10.1111/php.13685 [doi]
AB  - The unbridled dissemination of multidrug-resistant pathogens is a major threat toglobal health and urgently demands novel therapeutic alternatives. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) has been developed as a promising approach to treatlocalized infections regardless of drug resistance profile or taxonomy. Eventhough this technique has been known for more than a century, discussions andspeculations regarding the biochemical mechanisms of microbial inactivation have never reached a consensus on what is the primary cause of cell death. Sincephotochemically generated oxidants promote ubiquitous reactions with variousbiomolecules, researchers simply assumed that all cellular structures are equallydamaged. In this study, biochemical, molecular, biological, and advancedmicroscopy techniques were employed to investigate whether protein, membrane orDNA damage correlates better with dose-dependent microbial inactivation kinetics.We showed that although mild membrane permeabilization and late DNA damage occur,no correlation with inactivation kinetics was found. On the other hand, proteindegradation was analyzed by 3 different methods and showed a dose-dependent trendthat matches microbial inactivation kinetics. Our results provide a deepermechanistic understanding of aPDT that can guide the scientific community towardsthe development of optimized photosensitizing drugs and also rationally proposesynergistic combinations with antimicrobial chemotherapy.

TI  - De novo SIX2 activation in human kidneys treated with neonatal kidneystem/progenitor cells.
LID - 10.1111/ajt.17164 [doi]
AB  - During development, nephron structures are derived from a SIX2+ stem cellpopulation. After 36 weeks of gestation, these cells are exhausted, and no newnephrons are formed. We have previously described a non-invasive strategy toisolate and expand the native SIX2+ kidney stem cells from the urine of pretermneonates, named neonatal kidney stem/progenitor cells (nKSPC). Here, weinvestigated the safety and feasibility of administering nKSPC into human kidneysdiscarded for transplantation during normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) andevaluated the regenerative and immunomodulatory potential of nKSPC treatment. We found that nKSPC administration during NMP is safe and feasible. Interestingly,nKSPC induced the de novo expression of SIX2 in proximal tubular cells of thedonor kidneys and upregulated regenerative markers such as SOX9 and VEGF. This isthe first time that SIX2 re-expression is observed in adult human kidneys.Moreover, nKSPC administration significantly lowered levels of kidney injurybiomarkers and reduced inflammatory cytokine levels via thetryptophan-IDO-kynurenine pathway. In conclusion, nKSPC are a novel cell type to be applied in kidney-targeted cell therapy, with potential to induce anendogenous regenerative process and immunomodulation.

TI  - The Toxicity and Antibacterial Effects of Povidone-Iodine Irrigation in Fracture Surgery.
LID - 10.1111/os.13422 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgical site infection is a common complication of surgery,especially in orthopedics. Povidone-Iodine (PI) is one of the oldest and mostcommonly used disinfectants in surgery. However, the toxicity and antimicrobialeffect of PI have not been discussed. In addition, no study has explored theoptimum PI concentration for sterilization and tissue healing. This studyexplores the germicidal efficacy of different concentrations PI, in addition, thetoxicity and antibacterial effects of PI irrigation in fracture surgery are also discussed. METHODS: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonasaeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) were used to evaluate the germicidal efficacy of PI invitro and in vivo. In vitro, the effects of PI on bacterial growth were analyzed.2.5%, 1.25%, 0.5%, 0.25%, 0.05%, 0.025%, 0.005%, 0.0025% and 0% PI was added intothe bacterial suspension, besides, the bacterial algebra and growth rate weretested. Meanwhile, the fluorescence intensity of viable bacteria was also tested to evaluate the effects of PI on bacterial survival. In vivo, first, femoralfracture with wound infection rat models were established. Second, thyroid gland sections, blood thyroxine, urinary iodine, wound local skin, muscle and bonetissue sections, serum creatinine and alanine aminotransferase, serum and bonelocal tissue interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-10 (IL-10), bone morphogeneticprotein (BMP-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforminggrowth factor (TGF-beta1) were detected in rat femoral shaft fracture model with 5%, 2.5%, 0.5%, 0.05%, and 0% PI irrigation. Third, tissue bacteria culture wastested in rat femoral fracture with wound infection model with differentconcentrations PI irrigation. RESULTS: In vitro, 2.5%, 1.25%, 0.5% PI inhibitedthe growth of bacteria. 1.25%, 0.5% PI killed all the bacteria, while 0.25%,0.05% PI had not killed bacteria after about 10 min. The iodine absorption of 5%,2.5%, 0.5% PI irrigation did not cause thyroid injury. The 5%, 2.5%, 0.5% PIirrigation did not make serum creatinine and alanine aminotransferase abnormaland can remove bacteria from wounds. The 0.5%, 2.5% PI irrigation can promotetissue healing and increase BMP-2, VEGF, TGF-beta1, IL-10, in addition, decrease IL-6. 5% PI irrigation would inhibit tissue healing, and increase IL-6, decrease BMP-2, VEGF, TGF-beta1, IL-10. CONCLUSIONS: Povidone-Iodine was a widely useddisinfectant and 2.5%, 1.25% and 0.5% PI could effectively kill bacteria. Fivepercent and lower concentration PI irrigation was safe and could not causethyroid, kidney and liver damage. The 0.5% PI irrigation was beneficial fortissue healing but 5% PI irrigation was the opposite.

AB  - Developing non-antibiotic-dependent antibacterial hydrogels for repairinginfected skin defect remains largely unexplored. Herein, a synergic photothermal and synergic antibacterial hydrogel was designed via one-pot approach to copewith full-thickness skin wound infection. In this work, the mixture ofsilversodium lignin sulfonate nanoparticles (Ag-SLS NPs) andpolypyrrole-polydopamine nanoparticles (PPy-PDA NPs) for the first time assynergic photothermal agent was introduced into poly (ethylene glycol) diacrylate(PEGDA) to form Ag-SLS/PPy-PDA@PEGDA hydrogel. Thanks to the near-infrared light into heat conversion capacity of both Ag and PPy-PDA NPs, the formed hydrogelshows ultrahigh photothermal activity, and outstanding antibacterial activity to both Gram-negative (E. coli) and Gram-positive (S. aureus) bacteria in vitro.Additionally, in vivo assay indicates that the hydrogel has outstanding long-termantibacterial effect due to the photothermal sterilization along with Ag ionsrelease. Overall, the dual-synergic photothermal and antibacterial effects of theAg-SLS/PPy-PDA@PEGDA hydrogel could highly accelerate infection wound healing,and thus has great potential to be used for tissue engineering.

Among them, amorphous magnesiumphosphates (AMP)s indicated a higher rate of resorption, while preserving highosteoblasts viability and proliferation, which is comparable to their CaP peers. However, fast degradation of AMP leads to the initial fast release of Mg(2+) ionsand adverse effects on its excellent biological features. It seems that theaddition of graphene oxide (GO) to magnesium phosphate can moderate itsdegradation rate. Hence, a novel in situ synthesized AMP powders containing 0.05,0.25, 0.5, and 1 wt% of graphene oxide (AMP/GO) were developed to achieve afavorable degradation rate, desirable antibacterial properties against bothEscherichia coli (E. coli), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) accompanying withproper cell viability and proliferation. The incorporation of 0.5 wt% of grapheneoxide into the AMP ceramic led to reduce the release of Mg(2+) ions from 571.2+/- 12.9 mg/L to 372.8 +/- 14.7 mg/L and P ions from 354.8 +/- 11.9 mg/L to 245.3+/- 9.9 mg/L, at day 10 of immersion in PBS. Besides, AMP/0.5 GO bioceramics werecapable of eradicating all bacterial colonies of both strains. On the other hand,MG63 cells viability went up from 143.46% +/- 7.54 to 184.46% +/- 11.54 on the7th day of culture in the presence of 0.5 wt% of GO compared to pure AMP ceramic.Furthermore, alizarin red staining and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activitydemonstrated the ability of AMP/GO to maintain the osteogenic phenotype of MG63cells during 7 days culture. Therefore, it can be concluded that well distributedand in situ synthesized AMP/0.5GO powders can be a promising biomaterial for bonetissue regeneration.

AB  - The use of chemically synthesized nanoparticles and crude plant extracts asantimicrobial -anticancer agents have many limitations. In this study, we haveused Centella asiatica extract (CaE) having relatively less explored buttremendous medicinal properties, as reducing and stabilizing agents to greensynthesize magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgONPs) using magnesium nitrate. Incomparison to the bulk material, capabilities of Ca-MgONPs as an improvedantibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer agent in human prostatic carcinomacells (PC3), as well as membranolytic capability in model cell membrane, werestudied. The phyto-functionalized Ca-MgONPs were characterized using UV-Visiblespectroscopy (UV-Vis), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform Infra-RedSpectroscopy (FT-IR) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Observation ofcharacteristic peaks by spectroscopic and microscopic analysis confirmed thesynthesis of Ca-MgONPs. The Ca-MgONPs showed broad spectrum of bactericidalactivity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and fungicidalactivity against two species of the Candida fungus. The Ca-MgONPs also exhibited dose-dependent and selective inhibition of proliferating PC3 cells with IC50 of123.65 +/- 4.82 mug/mL at 24 h, however, without having any cytotoxicity towardnon-cancerous HEK293 cells. Further studies aimed at understanding the probablemechanism of toxicity of Ca-MgONPs in PC3 cells, the results indicated asignificant reduction in cell migration capacities, increment in cytosolic ROS,loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential, DNA damage and S-phase cell cycle arrest. Ca-MgONPs also induced pore formation in a synthetic large unilamellarvesicle. Thus, Ca-MgONPs might be useful in the effective management of severalhuman pathogens of concern and some more cancer types.

AB  - To provide antibacterial properties, the titanium samples were subjected toelectrochemical oxidation in the fluoride-containing diethylene glycol-basedelectrolyte to create a titanium oxide nanotubular surface. Afterward, thesurface was covered by sputtering with silver 5 nm film, and the tops of thenanotubes were capped using laser treatment, resulting in an appearance of silvernanoparticles (AgNPs) of around 30 nm in diameter on such a modified surface. To ensure a controlled release of the bactericidal substance, the samples wereadditionally coated with a pH-sensitive chitosan/Eudragit 100 coating, alsoexhibiting bactericidal properties. The modified titanium samples werecharacterized using SEM, EDS, AFM, Raman, and XPS techniques. The wettability,corrosion properties, adhesion of the coating to the substrate, the release ofAgNPs into solutions simulating body fluids at different pH, and antibacterialproperties were further investigated. The obtained composite coatings werehydrophilic, adjacent to the surface, and corrosion-resistant. An increase in theamount of silver released as ions or metallic particles into a simulated bodyfluid solution at acidic pH was observed for modified samples with the biopolymercoating after three days of exposure avoiding burst effect. The proposedmodification was effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

AB  - Altered wound healing is a major challenge faced by both developed and developingnations. Biofilm formation has been identified as one of the causative factorsfor the progression of chronic wounds. The spread of biofilm is controlled byinhibiting the biofilm formation or disrupting the mature biofilm. Functionalnanomaterials/enzymes with antimicrobial effects, such as metal oxides, rareearth metals, and carbon nanoparticles have been investigated to treat biofilmand overcome the drawbacks associated with the antibiotic therapy. Cerium oxidenanoparticles (CNPs) have drawn significant attention as a promisingantimicrobial agent owing to their antibacterial, enzyme-mimetic, and crystallineproperties but they suffer from poor colloidal stability and dispersity in anaqueous environment and size-dependent function. In this work, we have developed a functionalized silica ceria nanocomposite (FSC), as an antibiotic-free system, to treat biofilms. The FSC possesses a high surface area of mesoporous silicananoparticles (MSNs) combined with the intrinsic antibacterial activity of ceriumoxide for biofilm inhibition. The nanocomposite was fabricated using silica andceria precursors, and it exhibited a high surface area of 436 m(2)/g and anaverage particle size of around 450 nm. The physical and chemical properties ofnanocomposite were characterized using FTIR, XRD, UV-Vis, BET, EDX, and XPSanalysis. It exhibited a potent antioxidant activity (86%), positivehaloperoxidase mimetic property, and broad-spectrum antibacterial activities. It showed 99.9% inhibition against S. aureus (Gram-positive) and 81% inhibitionagainst E. coli (Gram-negative) within 12 and 24 h along with the significantinhibition of biofilm formation (80%) as well as the disruptive effect againstthe established biofilm (77%) of S. aureus. Cell viability assays indicated theproliferative nature of composite in normal basal conditions and increased cellviability (97%) in the presence of oxidative stress. Despite being a cationicnanomaterial, it showed a good hemocompatibility against human blood and causedcomplete wound closure in mouse fibroblast cell line within 24 h. Thefunctionalized silica ceria nanocomposite developed has a strong potential inchronic wound healing applications.

AB  - The alpha-l-Lysine (LL) grafting onto the enzymatic poly(gallic acid) (PGAL)produces a helicoidal brush-like antimicrobial polymer containing outerpositive-charged moieties. Best results are found with ca. 16 mol%alpha-LL-grafting for the inhibition of gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus andgram-negative Escherichia coli strains. Membrane permeability, confocal andscanning electron microscopy studies suggest a pore-formation and translocationmechanisms by initial electrostatic interaction of positive charged polymer atthe negatively charged bacterial membranes. The attained polymer displays highconcentration of hemolysis (Hc) in erythrocytes, and no lymphocyte mitochondrial activity. Interestingly, PGAL-LL is not cytotoxic on human dermal fibroblast. Theantioxidant activity after the LL hybridization is also demonstrated by DPPH,ORAC, FRAP and hydroxyl radical scavenging, which enhances the preservation ofhuman cells in addition to antimicrobial for this polymer.

AB  - An anti-infective bilayer implant coating with selectively activatable propertieswas developed to prevent biofilm formation and to support the treatment ofperiprosthetic infection as a local adjunct to current treatment concepts. In afirst step, Ti6Al4V discs were coated with a permanent layer of Poly(l-lactide)(PLLA) including silver ions. The PLLA could be optionally released by theapplication of extracorporeal shock waves. In a second step, a resorbable layerof triglyceride (TAG) with incorporated antibiotics was applied. The second layeris designed for resorption within weeks. Prior to approval and clinicalapplication, a comprehensive evaluation process to determine mechanical/physical and microbiological properties is obligate. To date, none of the existing teststandards covers both drug-releasing and activatable coatings for orthopedicimplants. Therefore, a comprehensive test concept was developed to characterizethe new coating in a pilot series. The coatings were homogeneously applied on theTi6Al4V substrate, resulting in an adhesion strength sufficient fornon-articulating surfaces for PLLA. Proof of the extracorporeal shockwaveactivation of PLLA was demonstrated both mechanically and microbiologically, witha simultaneous increase of biocompatibility compared to standard electroplatedsilver coating. Wettability was significantly reduced for both layers incomparison to the Ti6Al4V substrate. Thus, potentially inhibiting biofilmformation. Furthermore, the TAG coating promoted cell proliferation and bacterialeradication. In conclusion, the testing concept is applicable for similarbiopolymer coating systems. Furthermore, the extracorporeal activation couldrepresent a completely new supportive approach for the treatment ofperiprosthetic joint infections.

AB  - Developing antimicrobial biomaterials is a major challenge in the fields oforthopaedic and dental implants. In this study, we evaluated the bone-bondingability and antibacterial activity of a novel biomaterial for preventingimplant-associated infections. We have previously reported that NaOH heattreatment improved the bone-bonding ability of titanium, which was later modifiedto release target ions from the calcium titanate surface. Iodine, an essentialnutrient, exhibits broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity; hence, we designed acalcium titanate that releases iodine ions (Ca-I-Ti). The material was preparedfrom a simple solution using heat treatments as well as inexpensive devices andchemical agents. MC3T3-E1 cells seeded on Ca-I-Ti displayed high degrees ofbioactivity and viability, and Ca-I-Ti exhibited antibacterial activity againstmethicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. In vivo biomechanical andhistological experiments showed that Ca-I-Ti had excellent bone-bonding abilityat 8 weeks after implantation. In a subcutaneous infection model in rats,methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus on the implant was reduced byapproximately 95% compared to that on commercially pure titanium, indicating thatCa-I-Ti has antibacterial effects in vivo. In addition, no local or systemiccomplications were observed, and active infection in the surrounding tissues was histologically inhibited. Thus, iodine-containing calcium titanate is a safebiomaterial with excellent bioactivity and antibacterial properties, indicatingits potential in preventing implant-associated infections.

TI  - Conformational Changes in Herpes Simplex Virus Glycoprotein C.
PG  - e0016322
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00163-22 [doi]
AB  - Low endosomal pH facilitates herpesvirus entry in a cell-specific manner. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) causes significant morbidity and death in humansworldwide. HSV-1 enters cells by low-pH and neutral-pH pathways. Low-pH-inducedconformational changes in the HSV envelope glycoprotein B (gB) may mediatemembrane fusion during viral entry. HSV-1 gC, a 511-amino acid, type I integralmembrane glycoprotein, mediates HSV-1 attachment to host cell surfaceglycosaminoglycans, but this interaction is not essential for viral entry. Wepreviously demonstrated that gC regulates low-pH viral entry independent of itsknown role in cell attachment. Low-pH-triggered conformational changes in gBoccur at a lower pH when gC is absent, suggesting that gC positively regulates gBconformational changes. Here, we demonstrate that mildly acidic pH triggersconformational changes in gC itself. Low-pH treatment of virions inducedantigenic changes in distinct gC epitopes, and those changes were reversible. Oneof these gC epitopes is recognized by a monoclonal antibody that binds to alinear sequence that includes residues within gC amino acids 33 to 123. Thisantibody inhibited low-pH entry of HSV, suggesting that its gC N-terminal epitopeis particularly important. We propose that gC plays a critical role in HSV entry through a low-pH endocytosis pathway, which is a major entry route in humanepithelial cells. IMPORTANCE Herpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that causelifelong latent infections and are characterized by multiple entry pathways. The HSV envelope gC regulates HSV entry by a low-pH entry route. The fusion proteingB undergoes pH-triggered conformational changes that are facilitated by gC.Here, we report that gC itself undergoes a conformational change at low pH. Amonoclonal antibody to gC that binds to a region that undergoes pH-inducedchanges also selectively inhibits HSV low-pH entry, corroborating the importance of gC in the low-pH entry pathway. This study illustrates the complex role ofendosomal pH during HSV entry and provides novel insights into the functions ofgC.

TI  - Riplet Binds the Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP) and Augments ZAP-MediatedRestriction of HIV-1.
PG  - e0052622
LID - 10.1128/jvi.00526-22 [doi]
AB  - The zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) is an interferon-stimulated gene (ISG)with potent intrinsic antiviral activity. ZAP inhibits the replication ofretroviruses, including murine leukemia virus (MLV) and HIV-1, as well asalphaviruses, filoviruses, and hepatitis B virus, and also the retrotranspositionof LINE-1 and Alu retroelements. ZAP operates posttranscriptionally to reduce thelevels of viral transcripts available for translation in the cytoplasm, although additional functions might be involved. Recent studies have shown that ZAPpreferentially binds viral mRNAs containing clusters of CpG dinucleotides via itsfour CCCH-type zinc fingers. ZAP lacks enzymatic activity and utilizes othercellular proteins to suppress viral replication. Tripartite motif 25 (TRIM25) andthe nuclease KHNYN have been identified as ZAP cofactors. In this study, weidentify Riplet, a protein known to play a central role in the activation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), as a novel ZAP cofactor. Overexpressionof Riplet acts to strongly augment ZAP's antiviral activity. Riplet is an E3ubiquitin ligase containing three domains, an N-terminal RING finger domain, acentral coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal P/SPRY domain. We show that Ripletinteracts with ZAP via its P/SPRY domain and that the ubiquitin ligase activityof Riplet is not required to stimulate ZAP-mediated virus inhibition. Moreover,we show that Riplet interacts with TRIM25, suggesting that both Riplet and TRIM25may operate as a complex to augment ZAP activity. IMPORTANCE The ZAP is a potent restriction factor inhibiting replication of many RNA viruses by binding directlyto viral RNAs and targeting them for degradation. We here identify RIPLET as acofactor that stimulates ZAP activity. The finding connects ZAP to other innateimmunity pathways and suggests oligomerization as a common theme in sensingpathogenic RNAs.

AB  - Emerging studies reveal unique bacterial communities in the human bladder, withalteration of composition associated to disease states. Systemic lupuserythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease that is characterized byfrequent impairment of the kidney. Here, we explored the bladder microbiome,metabolome, and cytokine profiles in SLE patients, as well as correlationsbetween microbiome and metabolome, cytokines, and disease profiles. We recruited a group of 50 SLE patients and 50 individually matched asymptomatic controls. We used transurethral catheterization to collect urine samples, 16S rRNA genesequencing to profile bladder microbiomes, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry to perform untargeted metabolomic profiling. Compared to controls,SLE patients possessed unique bladder microbial communities and increased alphadiversity. These differences were accompanied by differences in urinarymetabolomes, cytokines, and patients' disease profiles. The SLE-enriched genera, including Bacteroides, were positively correlated with several SLE-enrichedmetabolites, including olopatadine. The SLE-depleted genera, such as Pseudomonas,were negatively correlated to SLE-depleted cytokines, including interleukin-8.Alteration of the bladder microbiome was associated with disease profile. Forexample, the genera Megamonas and Phocaeicola were negatively correlated withserum complement component 3, and Streptococcus was positively correlated withIgG. Our present study reveals associations between the bladder microbiome andthe urinary metabolome, cytokines, and disease phenotypes. Our results could helpidentify biomarkers for SLE. IMPORTANCE Contrary to dogma, the human urinarybladder possesses its own unique bacterial community with alteration ofcomposition associated with disease states.

TI  - Hypervariable-Locus Melting Typing: a Novel Approach for More EffectiveHigh-Resolution Melting-Based Typing, Suitable for Large MicrobiologicalSurveillance Programs.
PG  - e0100922
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01009-22 [doi]
AB  - Pathogen typing is pivotal to detecting the emergence of high-risk clones inhospital settings and to limit their spread. Unfortunately, the most commonlyused typing methods (i.e., pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE], multilocussequence typing [MLST], and whole-genome sequencing [WGS]) are expensive ortime-consuming, limiting their application to real-time surveillance.High-resolution melting (HRM) can be applied to perform cost-effective and fastpathogen typing, but developing highly discriminatory protocols is challenging.Here, we present hypervariable-locus melting typing (HLMT), a novel approach toHRM-based typing that enables the development of more effective and portabletyping protocols. HLMT types the strains by assigning them to melting types (MTs)on the basis of a reference data set (HLMT-assignment) and/or by clustering them using melting temperatures (HLMT-clustering). We applied the HLMT protocoldeveloped on the capsular gene wzi for Klebsiella pneumoniae on 134 strainscollected during surveillance programs in four hospitals. Then, we compared theHLMT results to those obtained using wzi, MLST, WGS, and PFGE typing. HLMTdistinguished most of the K. pneumoniae high-risk clones with a sensitivitycomparable to that of PFGE and MLST+wzi. It also drew surveillanceepidemiological curves comparable to those obtained using MLST+wzi, PFGE, and WGStyping. Furthermore, the results obtained using HLMT-assignment were consistentwith those of wzi typing for 95% of the typed strains, with a Jaccard index valueof 0.9. HLMT is a fast and scalable approach for pathogen typing, suitable forreal-time hospital microbiological surveillance. HLMT is also inexpensive, andthus, it is applicable for infection control programs in low- and middle-incomecountries. IMPORTANCE In this work, we describe hypervariable-locus meltingtyping (HLMT), a novel fast approach to pathogen typing using the high-resolutionmelting (HRM) assay. The method includes a novel approach for gene targetselection, primer design, and HRM data analysis. We successfully applied thismethod to distinguish the high-risk clones of Klebsiella pneumoniae, one of themost important nosocomial pathogens worldwide. We also compared HLMT to typingusing WGS, the capsular gene wzi, MLST, and PFGE. Our results show that HLMT is atyping method suitable for real-time epidemiological investigation. Theapplication of HLMT to hospital microbiology surveillance can help to rapidlydetect outbreak emergence, improving the effectiveness of infection controlstrategies.

TI  - Deterministic Factors Determine the Comammox Community Composition in the PearlRiver Estuary Ecosystem.
PG  - e0101622
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01016-22 [doi]
AB  - Complete ammonia oxidizers (comammox) have been widely detected in riverine andestuarine ecosystems. However, knowledge about the process of comammox community assembly from freshwater to marine environments is still limited. Here, based on deep sequencing, we investigated the community composition of comammox along asalinity gradient in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), South China. Our resultsshowed that comammox microorganisms in the PRE sediments were extremely diverseand displayed distinct distributional patterns between upstream and downstreamhabitats. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that comammox was the dominantammonia-oxidizing microorganism (AOM) in the PRE upstream sediments, andammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) dominated the PRE downstream sediments, whileammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were not dominant in any section of the PRE.Neutral modeling revealed that stochastic processes explained a limited part ofthe variation in the comammox community. The majority of beta nearest-taxon indexvalues were higher than 2, indicating that comammox community assembly in the PREsediments was better explained through a deterministic process than through astochastic process. Salinity and total nitrogen were the most importantcontributing factors that shaped the comammox community. This study expanded the current knowledge of the diversity and niche preference of comammox in theestuarine ecosystem, and further enhances our understanding of the assembly ofcomammox community from freshwater to marine environments. IMPORTANCE Microbialcommunities are shaped by stochastic (emigration, immigration, birth, death, and genetic drift of species) and deterministic (e.g., environmental factors)processes. However, it remains unknown as to which type of process is moreimportant in influencing the comammox community assembly from freshwater tomarine environments. In this study, we compared the relative importance ofstochastic and deterministic processes in shaping the assembly of the comammoxcommunity, which demonstrated that the deterministic process was more importantin determining the community assembly patterns in the PRE ecosystem.

TI  - Methicillin Resistant Staphylococci Isolated from Goats and Their FarmEnvironments in Saudi Arabia Genotypically Linked to Known Human ClinicalIsolates: a Pilot Study.
PG  - e0038722
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00387-22 [doi]
AB  - We conducted a pilot whole genome sequencing (WGS) study to characterize thegenotypes of nine methicillin resistant staphylococci (MRS) isolates recoveredfrom goats and their farm environments in Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia, betweenNovember 2019 to August 2020. Seven out of nine isolates were methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and two were methicillin resistantStaphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE). All MRSA isolates possessed genotypespreviously identified to infect humans, including isolates harboring ST6-SCCmecIV-t304 (n = 4), ST5-SCCmec VI- t688 (n = 2) and ST5-SCCmec V-t311 (n = 1). 2MRSA isolates possessed plasmids that were genetically similar to thoseidentified in S. aureus isolates recovered from humans and poultry. In contrast, plasmids found in three MRSA isolates and one MRSE isolate were geneticallysimilar to those recovered from humans. All MRSA isolates harbored the hostinnate modulate genes sak and scn previously associated with human infections.The genotypes of MRSE isolates were determined as ST35, a well-known zoonoticsequence type and ST153, which has been associated with humans. However, the MRSEisolates were untypeable due to extra ccr complexes identified in their SCCmecelements. Moreover, we identified in ST153 isolate SCCmec element also harboredthe Arginine Catabolic Mobile Element (ACME) IV. All MRS isolates werephenotypically resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic for the decolonization of MRS. Three isolates carried antibiotic resistance genes intheir SCCmec elements that were not previously described, including thoseencoding fusidic acid resistance (fusC) and trimethoprim resistance (dfrC)incorporated in the MRSA SCCmec VI. IMPORTANCE Our findings demonstrate apossible cross-transmission of methicillin resistant staphylococci between goats and their local environments and between goats and humans. Due to ever increasingresistance to multiple antibiotics, the burden of MRS has a significant impact onlivestock farming, public health, and the economy worldwide. This studyhighlights that implementing a holistic approach to whole genome sequencingsurveillance in livestock and farm environments would aid our understanding ofthe transmission of methicillin resistant staphylococci and, most importantly,allow us to implement appropriate infection control and hygiene practices.

TI  - Systemic Candida albicans Infection in Mice Causes Endogenous Endophthalmitis viaBreaching the Outer Blood-Retinal Barrier.
PG  - e0165822
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01658-22 [doi]
AB  - Candida albicans is the leading cause of endogenous fungal endophthalmitis;however, its pathobiology studies are limited. Moreover, the contribution of hostfactors in the pathogenesis of Candida endophthalmitis remains unclear. In thepresent study, we developed a murine model of C. albicans endogenousendophthalmitis and investigated the molecular pathobiology of ocular candidiasisand blood-retinal barrier permeability. Our data show that intravenous injection of C. albicans in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice led to endogenous endophthalmitis without causing mortality, and C. albicans was detected in the eyes at 3 dayspostinfection and persisted for up to 10 days. The intraocular presence of C.albicans coincided with a decrease in retinal function and increased expressionof inflammatory mediators (tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha], interleukin1beta [IL-1beta], MIP2, and KC) and antimicrobial peptides (human beta-defensins [hBDs] and LL37) in mouse retinal tissue. C. albicans infection disrupted theblood-retinal barrier (BRB) by decreasing the expression of tight junction (ZO-1)and adherens junction (E-cadherin, N/R-cadherin) proteins. In vitro studies usinghuman retinal pigment epithelial (ARPE-19) cells showed time-dependent activationof eIF2alpha, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK), and NF-kappaB signaling and decreased activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) leading to theinduction of an inflammatory response upon C. albicans infection. Moreover, C.albicans-infected cells exhibited increased cellular permeability coinciding witha reduction in cellular junction proteins. Overall, our study provides newinsight into the molecular pathogenesis of C. albicans endogenousendophthalmitis. Furthermore, the experimental models developed in the study can be used to identify newer therapeutic targets or test the efficacy of drugs totreat and prevent fungal endophthalmitis. IMPORTANCE Patients with candidemiaoften experience endophthalmitis, a blinding infectious eye disease. However, thepathogenesis of Candida endophthalmitis is not well understood. Here, using invivo and in vitro experimental models, we describe events leading to the invasionof Candida into the eye. We show that Candida from the systemic circulationdisrupts the protective blood-retinal barrier and causes endogenousendophthalmitis. Our study highlights an important role of retinal pigmentepithelial cells in evoking innate inflammatory and antimicrobial responsestoward C. albicans infection. This study allows a better understanding of thepathobiology of fungal endophthalmitis, which can lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic targets to treat ocular fungal infections.

TI  - Glutamate Enhances Osmoadaptation of Anammox Bacteria under High Salinity:Genomic Analysis and Experimental Evidence.
LID - 10.1021/acs.est.2c01104 [doi]
AB  - An osmoprotectant that alleviates the bacterial osmotic stress can improve thebioreactor treatment of saline wastewater. However, proposed candidates areexpensive, and osmoprotectants of anammox bacteria and their ecophysiologicalroles are not fully understood. In this study, a comparative analysis of 34high-quality public metagenome-assembled genomes from anammox bacteria revealedtwo distinct groups of osmoadaptation. Candidatus Scalindua and Kuenenia share a close phylogenomic relation and osmoadaptation gene profile and have pathways forglutamate transport and metabolisms for enhanced osmoadaptation. The batch assay results demonstrated that the reduced Ca. Kuenenia activity in saline conditions was substantially alleviated with the addition and subsequent synergistic effectsof potassium and glutamate. The operational test of two reactors demonstratedthat the reduced anammox performance under brine conditions rapidly recovered by 35.7-43.1% as a result of glutamate treatment. The Ca. Kuenenia 16S rRNA andhydrazine gene expressions were upregulated significantly (p < 0.05), and theabundance increased by approximately 19.9%, with a decrease in dominantheterotrophs. These data demonstrated the effectiveness of glutamate inalleviating the osmotic stress of Ca. Kuenenia. This study provides genomicinsight into group-specific osmoadaptation of anammox bacteria and can facilitatethe precision management of anammox reactors under high salinity.

LID - 10.1128/msystems.00228-22 [doi]
AB  - Gemmatimonadota is a phylum-level lineage distributed widely but rarely reported.Only six representatives of Gemmatimonadota have so far been isolated andcultured in laboratory. The physiology, ecology, and evolutionary history of thisphylum remain unknown. The 16S rRNA gene survey of our salt lake and deep-seasediments, and Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) samples, reveals thatGemmatimonadota exist in diverse environments globally. In this study, weretrieved 17 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from salt lake sediments (12MAGs) and deep-sea sediments (5 MAGs). Analysis of these MAGs and thenonredundant MAGs or genomes from public databases reveals Gemmatimonadota candegrade various complex organic substrates, and mainly employ heterotrophicpathways (e.g., glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle) for growth viaaerobic respiration. And the processes of sufficient energy being stored inglucose through gluconeogenesis, followed by the synthesis of more complexcompounds, are prevalent in Gemmatimonadota. A highly expandable pangenome forGemmatimonadota has been observed, which presumably results from their adaptationto thriving in diverse environments. The enrichment of the Na(+)/H(+) antiporter in the SG8-23 order represents their adaptation to salty habitats. Notably, weidentified a novel lineage of the SG8-23 order, which is potentially anoxygenicphototrophic. This lineage is not closely related to the phototrophs in the orderof Gemmatimonadales. The two orders differ distinctly in the gene organizationand phylogenetic relationship of their photosynthesis gene clusters, indicatingphotosystems in Gemmatimonadota have evolved in two independent routes.IMPORTANCE The phylum Gemmatimonadota is widely distributed in variousenvironments. However, their physiology, ecology and evolutionary history remain unknown, primary due to the limited cultured isolates and available genomes. Wewere intrigued to find out how widespread this phylum is, and how it can thriveunder diverse conditions. Our results here expand the knowledge of the geneticand metabolic diversity of Gemmatimonadota, and shed light on the diverse energy conservation strategies (i.e., oxidative phosphorylation, substratephosphorylation, and photosynthetic phosphorylation) responsible for their globaldistribution. Moreover, gene organization and phylogenetic analysis ofphotosynthesis gene clusters in Gemmatimonadota provide a valuable insight intothe evolutionary history of photosynthesis.

TI  - Modeling-Guided Amendments Lead to Enhanced Biodegradation in Soil.
PG  - e0016922
LID - 10.1128/msystems.00169-22 [doi]
AB  - Extensive use of agrochemicals is emerging as a serious environmental issuecoming at the cost of the pollution of soil and water resources. Bioremediationtechniques such as biostimulation are promising strategies used to removepollutants from agricultural soils by supporting the indigenous microbialdegraders. Though considered cost-effective and eco-friendly, the success rate ofthese strategies typically varies, and consequently, they are rarely integratedinto commercial agricultural practices. In the current study, we appliedmetabolic-based community-modeling approaches for promoting realistic in terrasolutions by simulation-based prioritization of alternative supplements aspotential biostimulants, considering a collection of indigenous bacteria.Efficacy of biostimulants as enhancers of the indigenous degraderPaenarthrobacter was ranked through simulation and validated in pot experiments. A two-dimensional simulation matrix predicting the effect of differentbiostimulants on additional potential indigenous degraders (Pseudomonas,Clostridium, and Geobacter) was crossed with experimental observations. Theoverall ability of the models to predict the compounds that act as taxa-selectivestimulants indicates that computational algorithms can guide the manipulation of the soil microbiome in situ and provides an additional step toward the educateddesign of biostimulation strategies. IMPORTANCE Providing the food requirementsof a growing population comes at the cost of intensive use of agrochemicals,including pesticides. Native microbial soil communities are considered keyplayers in the degradation of such exogenous substances. Manipulating microbialactivity toward an optimized outcome in efficient biodegradation processesconveys a promise of maintaining intensive yet sustainable agriculture. Efficientstrategies for harnessing the native microbiome require the development ofapproaches for processing big genomic data. Here, we pursued metabolic modelingfor promoting realistic in terra solutions by simulation-based prioritization of alternative supplements as potential biostimulants, considering a collection ofindigenous bacteria. Our genomic-based predictions point at strategies foroptimizing biodegradation by the native community. Developing a systematic,data-guided understanding of metabolite-driven targeted enhancement of selectedmicroorganisms lays the foundation for the design of ecologically sound methodsfor optimizing microbiome functioning.

TI  - Profiles of Microbial Community and Antibiotic Resistome in Wild Tick Species.
PG  - e0003722
LID - 10.1128/msystems.00037-22 [doi]
AB  - Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens pose high risks to human and animal health worldwide. In recent years, the environment and wildlife as majorsources and reservoirs of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are beingincreasingly investigated. There have been many reports on bacterial community inticks, but little is known about ARGs they carry, and the correlation betweenbacterial and ARGs in wild ticks also remains unknown. Here, the profiles ofmicrobial community and antibiotic resistome in wild tick species wereinvestigated using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing and smart chip-basedhigh-throughput quantitative PCR approach (HT-qPCR), respectively. We found that bacterial composition in wild tick species is variable; the sequenced reads from all samples were assigned to 37 different phyla at the phylum level. The dominantphylum was Proteobacteria, which accounted for 75.60 +/- 10.34%, followed byBacteroidetes accounting for 13.78 +/- 11.68% of the total bacterial community.In total, 100 different ARGs across 12 antibiotic classes and 20 mobile geneticelements (MGEs) were identified by HT-qPCR, and among them aminoglycosides,multidrug, macrolide-clinolamide-streptogramin B, and tetracycline resistancegenes were the dominant ARG types. Co-occurrence patterns revealed by networkanalysis showed that eight bacterial genera may serve as the potential hosts for different ARGs. For the first time, this study provides comprehensive overview ofthe diversity and abundance of ARGs in wild ticks and highlights the possiblerole of wild ticks as ARG disseminators into the environment and vertebratehosts, with implications for human and animal health. IMPORTANCE The emergence ofantibiotic-resistant bacteria poses serious threat to the public health aroundthe world. Ticks are obligate hematophagous ectoparasites, surviving via feeding on the blood of various animal hosts. Although some previous studies haveconfirmed wild ticks carried various bacterial community, the role of wild ticks in the antibiotic resistance remains unknown. Here, identification of microbialcommunity and antibiotic resistome in wild tick species revealed that wild ticks are the reservoir, postulated potential spreaders of antibiotic resistance. Ourfindings highlight the contribution of wild ticks to the maintenance anddissemination of ARGs, and the associated health risks.

TI  - Comparative Metagenomics Highlight a Widespread Pathway Involved in Catabolism ofPhosphonates in Marine and Terrestrial Serpentinizing Ecosystems.
PG  - e0032822
LID - 10.1128/msystems.00328-22 [doi]
AB  - Serpentinizing hydrothermal systems result from water circulating into thesubsurface and interacting with mantle-derived rocks notably near mid-oceanridges or continental ophiolites. Serpentinization and associated reactionsproduce alkaline fluids enriched in molecular hydrogen, methane, and smallorganic molecules that are assumed to feed microbial inhabitants. In this study, we explored the relationships linking serpentinization to associated microbialcommunities by comparative metagenomics of serpentinite-hosted systems,basalt-hosted vents, and hot springs. The shallow Prony bay hydrothermal field(PBHF) microbiome appeared to be more related to those of ophiolitic sites thanto the Lost City hydrothermal field (LCHF) microbiome, probably because of themeteoric origin of its fluid, like terrestrial alkaline springs. This studyemphasized the ubiquitous importance of a set of genes involved in the catabolismof phosphonates and highly enriched in all serpentinizing sites compared to otherecosystems. Because most of the serpentinizing systems are depleted in inorganic phosphate, the abundance of genes involved in the carbon-phosphorus lyase pathwaysuggests that the phosphonates constitute a source of phosphorus in theseecosystems. Additionally, hydrocarbons such as methane, released upon phosphonatecatabolism, may contribute to the overall budget of organic molecules inserpentinizing systems. IMPORTANCE This first comparative metagenomic study ofserpentinite-hosted environments provides an objective framework to understandthe functioning of these peculiar ecosystems. We showed a taxonomic similaritybetween the PBHF and other terrestrial serpentinite-hosted ecosystems. At thesame time, the LCHF microbial community was closer to deep basalt-hostedhydrothermal fields than continental ophiolites, despite the influence ofserpentinization. This study revealed shared functional capabilities amongserpentinite-hosted ecosystems in response to environmental stress, themetabolism of abundant dihydrogen, and the metabolism of phosphorus. Our results are consistent with the generalized view of serpentinite environments but providedeeper insight into the array of factors that may control microbial activities inthese ecosystems. Moreover, we show that metabolism of phosphonate is widespread among alkaline serpentinizing systems and could play a crucial role in phosphorusand methane biogeochemical cycles. This study opens a new line of investigationof the metabolism of reduced phosphorus compounds in serpentinizing environments.

AB  - Most chemical or biological decontamination protocols have been driven by theneed for fast and efficient methods that are relatively safe and easy toimplement. As such, the focus has primarily been toward "general"environments-those in which water is readily available, and the ambientconditions are amenable to such techniques. Some of these include water showersand/or sprays with chemical decontaminants, eg, soapy water or diluted bleach.However, there exist some scenarios in which water-based decontamination methods are not desirable. These include such operational environments as arid regions(water scarcity), specialized operations (decontamination method must be lowvolume/weight), and cold weather (freezing risk). This study focuses on the cold weather challenge: identification of common methods for readily availabledecontamination and evaluation of their respective efficacies. Methods evaluated include wiping (with wet and dry wipes), blotting with moistened wipes,vacuuming, and the application and removal of adhesive tape. Results demonstrate that vacuuming and blotting (without overlapping targeted regions) are generally less effective than other wiping, blotting, and adhesive tape-based measures atremoving bacteria from surfaces.

LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01698-22 [doi]
AB  - Diarrhea caused by early-weaning-induced stress can increase mortality rates and reduce growth performance of piglets, seriously harming the livestock industry.To date, studies on the gut microbiome of early-weaned piglets have focusedalmost exclusively on bacteria, while studies on their gut virome are extremelylacking. Here, we used metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing combinedwith bioinformatic analysis techniques to preliminarily characterize theintestinal virome of early-weaned piglets at different biological classification levels. The alpha diversity of enteroviruses was generally elevated inearly-weaned piglets with diarrhea, compared to healthy piglets, whereas the two groups of piglets showed no significant difference in beta diversity. Inaddition, the species compositions of the gut virome were similar between healthypiglets and piglets with diarrhea, while their respective dominant species weresomewhat different. We also identified 58 differential DNA viruses and 16differential RNA viruses between the two groups of piglets at all biologicaltaxonomic levels. Of these, 1 (family Dhakavirus) and 6 (phylum Artverviricota,class Revtraviricetes, order Ortervirales, family Retroviridae, genusGammaretrovirus, and species Kirsten murine sarcoma virus) specific virusesdisappeared from the intestines of healthy piglets and piglets with diarrhea,respectively. Moreover, we found that some DNA and RNA viruses formed strongcorrelations among themselves or between them. IMPORTANCE This studysystematically reveals the biological diversity, structure, and composition ofintestinal DNA and RNA virus profiles in early-weaned piglets. Furthermore,characteristics of differences in gut viromes between early-weaned healthypiglets and piglets with diarrhea were also elucidated. Importantly, somepotential biomarkers for early-weaned piglets with diarrhea were identified.These findings fill a gap for the early-weaned piglet gut virome and lay thefoundation for the development of strategies to target enteroviruses for theprevention and treatment of early-weaning-induced piglet diarrhea.

TI  - A Role for Basigin in Toxoplasma gondii Infection.
PG  - e0020522
LID - 10.1128/iai.00205-22 [doi]
AB  - The role of specific host cell surface receptors during Toxoplasma gondiiinvasion of host cells is poorly defined. Here, we interrogated the role of thewell-known malarial invasion receptor, basigin, in T. gondii infection ofastrocytes. We found that primary astrocytes express two members of the BASIGIN(BSG) immunoglobulin family, basigin and embigin, but did not expressneuroplastin. Antibody blockade of either basigin or embigin caused a significantreduction of parasite infectivity in astrocytes. The specific role of basiginduring T. gondii invasion was further examined using a mouse astrocytic cell line(C8-D30), which exclusively expresses basigin. CRISPR-mediated deletion ofbasigin in C8-D30 cells resulted in decreased T. gondii infectivity. T. gondiireplication and invasion efficiency were not altered by basigin deficiency, butparasite attachment to astrocytes was markedly reduced. We also conducted aproteomic screen to identify T. gondii proteins that interact with basigin.Toxoplasma-encoded cyclophilins, the protein 14-3-3, and protein disulfideisomerase (TgPDI) were among the putative basigin-ligands identified. RecombinantTgPDI produced in E. coli bound to basigin and pretreatment of tachyzoites with aPDI inhibitor decreased parasite attachment to host cells. Finally, mutagenesisof the active site cysteines of TgPDI abolished enzyme binding to basigin. Thus, basigin and its related immunoglobulin family members may represent hostreceptors that mediate attachment of T. gondii to diverse cell types.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is generally believed to establish biofilm-associatedinfections under the regulation of the secondary messenger c-di-GMP. To evaluate P. aeruginosa biofilm physiology during ocular infections, comparativetranscriptomic analysis was performed on wild-type P. aeruginosa PAO1, aDeltawspF mutant strain (high c-di-GMP levels), and a plac-yhjH-containing strain(low c-di-GMP levels) from mouse corneal infection, as well as in vitro biofilmand planktonic cultures. The c-di-GMP content in P. aeruginosa during cornealinfection was monitored using a fluorescent c-di-GMP reporter strain.Biofilm-related genes were induced in in vivo PAO1 compared to in vitroplanktonic bacteria. Several diguanylate cyclases and phosphodiesterases werecommonly regulated in in vivo PAO1 and in vitro biofilm compared to in vitroplanktonic bacteria. Several exopolysaccharide genes and motility genes wereinduced and downregulated, respectively, in in vivo PAO1 and the in vivoDeltawspF mutant compared to the in vivo plac-yhjH-containing strain. Elevationof c-di-GMP levels in P. aeruginosa began as early as 2 h postinfection. TheDeltawspF mutant was less susceptible to host clearance than theplac-yhjH-containing strain and could suppress host immune responses. The typeIII secretion system (T3SS) was induced in in vivo PAO1 compared to in vitrobiofilm bacteria. A DeltawspF mutant with a defective T3SS was more susceptibleto host clearance than a DeltawspF mutant with a functional T3SS. Our studysuggests that elevated intracellular c-di-GMP levels and T3SS activity in P.aeruginosa are necessary for establishment of infection and modulation of hostimmune responses in mouse cornea.

TI  - Microalgae and Bacteria Interaction-Evidence for Division of Diligence in theAlga Microbiota.
PG  - e0063322
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00633-22 [doi]
AB  - Microalgae are one of the most dominant forms of life on earth that is tightlyassociated with a distinct and specialized microbiota. We have previously shownthat the microbiota of Scenedesmus quadricauda harbors less than 10 distinctmicrobial species. Here, we provide evidence that dominant species are affiliatedwith the genera of Variovorax, Porphyrobacter, and Dyadobacter. Experimental and transcriptome-based evidence implies that within this multispecies interaction,Dyadobacter is a key to alga growth and fitness and is highly adapted to live in the phycosphere. While presumably under light conditions the alga provides theenergy source to the bacteria, Dyadobacter produces and releases mainly a largevariety of polysaccharides modifying enzymes. This is coherent with high-levelexpression of the T9SS in alga cocultures. The transcriptome data further implythat quorum-quenching proteins (QQ) and biosynthesis of vitamins B1, B2, B5, B6, and B9 are expressed by Dyadobacter at high levels in comparison to Variovoraxand Porphyrobacter. Notably, Dyadobacter produces a significant number ofleucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins and enzymes involved in bacterial reactiveoxygen species (ROS) tolerance. Complementary to this, Variovorax expresses thegenes of the biosynthesis of vitamins B2, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12, andPorphyrobacter is specialized in the production of vitamins B2 and B6. Thus, the shared currency between partners are vitamins, microalgae growth-promotingsubstances, and dissolved carbon. This work significantly enlarges our knowledge on alga-bacteria interaction and demonstrates physiological investigations ofmicroalgae and associated bacteria, using microscopy observations, photosyntheticactivity measurements, and flow cytometry. IMPORTANCE The current study gives adetailed insight into mutualistic collaboration of microalgae and bacteria,including the involvement of competitive interplay between bacteria. We provideexperimental evidence that Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the Dyadobacter,Porphyrobacter, and Variovorax are the key players in a Scenedesmus quadricaudaalga-bacteria interaction. We impart strong evidence that Dyadobacter producesand releases polysaccharides degradation enzymes and leucine-rich repeatproteins; Variovorax supplies the consortium with auxins and vitamin B12, whilePorphyrobacter produces a broad spectrum of B vitamins. We show not only that themicroalgae collaborate with the bacteria and vice versa but also that thebacteria interact with each other via quorum-sensing and secretion systemmechanisms. The shared currency between partners appears to be vitamins,microalgae growth-promoting substances, and dissolved carbon.

TI  - Hibifolin, a Natural Sortase A Inhibitor, Attenuates the Pathogenicity ofStaphylococcus aureus and Enhances the Antibacterial Activity of Cefotaxime.
PG  - e0095022
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.00950-22 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to identify hibifolin as a sortase A (SrtA) inhibitor and todetermine whether it could attenuate the virulence of methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We employed a fluorescence resonance energytransfer (FRET) assay to screen a library of natural molecules to identifycompounds that inhibit SrtA activity. Fluorescence quenching assay and molecular docking were performed to verify the direct binding interaction between SrtA and hibifolin. The pneumonia model was established using C57BL/6J mice by MRAS nasal administration for evaluating the effect of hibifolin on the pathogenicity ofMRSA. Herein, we found that hibifolin was able to inhibit SrtA activity with anIC50 of 31.20 mug/mL. Further assays showed that the capacity of adhesion ofbacteria to the host cells and biofilm formation was decreased inhibifolin-treated USA300. Results obtained from fluorescence quenching assay and molecular docking indicated that hibifolin was capable of targeting SrtA protein directly. This interaction was further confirmed by the finding that theinhibition activities of hibifolin on mutant SrtA were substantially reducedafter mutating the binding sites (TRP-194, ALA-104, THR-180, ARG-197, ASN-114).The in vivo study showed that hibifolin in combination with cefotaxime protected mice from USA300 infection-induced pneumonia, which was more potent thancefotaxime alone, and no significant cytotoxicity of hibifolin was observed.Taken together, we identified that hibifolin attenuated the pathogenicity of S.aureus by directly targeting SrtA, which may be utilized in the future asadjuvant therapy for S. aureus infections. IMPORTANCE We identified hibifolin as a sortase A (SrtA) inhibitor by screening the natural compounds library, whicheffectively inhibited the activity of SrtA with an IC50 value of 31.20 mug/mL.Hibifolin attenuated the pathogenic behavior of Staphylococcus aureus, including adhesion, invasion, and biofilm formation. Binding assays showed that hibifolinbound to SrtA protein directly. Hibifolin improved the survival of pneumoniainduced by S. aureus USA300 in mice and alleviated the pathological damage.Moreover, hibifolin showed a synergistic antibacterial effect with cefotaxime in USA300-infected mice.

TI  - CroR Regulates Expression of pbp4(5) to Promote Cephalosporin Resistance inEnterococcus faecalis.
PG  - e0111922
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01119-22 [doi]
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen and a major cause of severenosocomial infections. Treatment options against enterococcal infections aredeclining due to the resistance of enterococci to numerous antibiotics. A keyrisk factor for developing enterococcal infections is treatment withcephalosporin antibiotics, to which enterococci are intrinsically resistant. For susceptible organisms, cephalosporins inhibit bacterial growth by acylating theactive site of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), key enzymes that catalyzepeptidoglycan cross-linking. Two specific PBPs of enterococci, Pbp4(5) andPbpA(2b), exhibit low reactivity toward cephalosporins, allowing these PBPs tocross-link peptidoglycan in the presence of cephalosporins to drive resistance inenterococci, but the mechanisms by which these PBPs are regulated are poorlyunderstood. The CroS/R two-component signal transduction system (TCS) is alsorequired for cephalosporin resistance. Activation of CroS/R by cephalosporinsleads to CroR-dependent changes in gene expression. However, the specific genesregulated by CroS/R that are responsible for cephalosporin resistance remainlargely unknown. In this study, we characterized CroR-dependent transcriptomeremodeling by RNA-seq, identifying pbp4(5) as a CroR regulon member in multiple, diverse lineages of E. faecalis. Through genetic analysis of the pbp4(5) and croRpromoters, we uncovered a CroR-dependent regulatory motif. Mutations in thismotif to disrupt CroR-dependent upregulation of pbp4(5) in the presence of cellwall stress resulted in a reduction of resistance to cephalosporins in E.faecalis, demonstrating that enhanced production of Pbp4(5) and likely otherproteins involved in peptidoglycan biogenesis by the CroS/R system drivesenterococcal cephalosporin resistance. IMPORTANCE Investigation into molecularmechanisms used by enterococci to subvert cephalosporin antibiotics is imperativefor preventing and treating life-threatening infections. In this study, we usedgenetic means to investigate the functional output of the CroS/R TCS required forenterococcal resistance to cephalosporins. We found that enhanced production ofthe penicillin-binding protein Pbp4(5) upon exposure to cell wall stress wasmediated by CroS/R and was critical for intrinsic cephalosporin resistance of E. faecalis.

TI  - Impact of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Mutations on Its Activation by TMPRSS2 and theAlternative TMPRSS13 Protease.

LID - 10.1128/mbio.01376-22 [doi]
AB  - The continuous emergence of new variants of severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) urges better understanding of the functional motifs inthe spike (S) protein and their tolerance to mutations. Here, we focused on theS2' motif, which, during virus entry, requires cleavage by a host cell proteaseto release the fusion peptide. Though belonging to an immunogenic region, theSARS-CoV-2 S2' motif (811-KPSKR-815) has shown hardly any variation, with itsthree basic (K/R) residues being >99.99% conserved thus far. By creating a seriesof mutant pseudoviruses bearing the spikes of Wuhan-Hu-1, its G614 mutant or the Delta and Omicron variants, we show that residue K814 (preceding the scissileR815) is dispensable for TMPRSS2 yet favored by the alternative TMPRSS13protease. Activation by TMPRSS13 was drastically reduced when the SARS-CoV-2 S2' motif was swapped with that of the low pathogenic 229E coronavirus(685-RVAGR-689), and also, the reverse effect was seen. This swap had no impacton recognition by TMPRSS2. In the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus(MERS-CoV) spike, introducing a dibasic scissile motif was easily accepted byTMPRSS13 but less so by TMPRSS2, confirming that TMPRSS13 favors a sequence rich in K/R residues. Pseudovirus entry experiments in Calu-3 cells confirmed that theS2' mutations have minor impact on TMPRSS2. Our findings are the first todemonstrate which S2' residues are important for SARS-CoV-2 spike activation bythese two airway proteases, with TMPRSS2 being more tolerant to variation thanTMPRSS13. This preemptive insight will help to estimate the impact of S2' motifchanges as they appear in new SARS-CoV-2 variants. IMPORTANCE Since itsintroduction in humans, SARS-CoV-2 is evolving with frequent appearance of newvariants. The surveillance would benefit from proactive characterization of thefunctional motifs in the spike (S) protein, the most variable viral factor. This is linked to immune evasion but also influences spike functioning. Remarkably,though located in a strongly immunogenic region, the S2' cleavage motif has, thusfar, remained highly conserved. This suggests that its sequence is critical forspike activation by airway proteases. To investigate this, we assessed howpseudovirus entry is affected by changes in the S2' motif. We demonstrate thatTMPRSS2 readily accepts variations in this motif, whereas the alternativeTMPRSS13 protease is more fastidious. The Wuhan-Hu-1, G614, Delta and Omicronspikes showed no difference in this regard. Being the first in its kind, ourstudy will help to assess the impact of S2' variations as soon as they aredetected during variant surveillance.

LID - 10.1128/mbio.01364-22 [doi]
AB  - Fecal communities transplanted into individuals can eliminate recurrentClostridioides difficile infection (CDI) with high efficacy. However, thistreatment is only used once CDI becomes resistant to antibiotics or has recurred multiple times. We sought to investigate whether a fecal community transplant(FCT) pretreatment could be used to prevent CDI altogether. We treated maleC57BL/6 mice with either clindamycin, cefoperazone, or streptomycin and theninoculated them with the microbial community from untreated mice before challengewith C. difficile. We measured colonization and sequenced the V4 region of the16S rRNA gene to understand the dynamics of the murine fecal community inresponse to the FCT and C. difficile challenge. Clindamycin-treated mice becamecolonized with C. difficile but cleared it naturally and did not benefit from theFCT. Cefoperazone-treated mice became colonized by C. difficile, but the FCTenabled clearance of C. difficile. In streptomycin-treated mice, the FCT was ableto prevent C. difficile from colonizing. We then diluted the FCT and repeated theexperiments. Cefoperazone-treated mice no longer cleared C. difficile. However,streptomycin-treated mice colonized with 1:10(2) dilutions resisted C. difficile colonization. Streptomycin-treated mice that received an FCT diluted 1:10(3)became colonized with C. difficile but later cleared the infection. Instreptomycin-treated mice, inhibition of C. difficile was associated withincreased relative abundance of a group of bacteria related to Porphyromonadaceaeand Lachnospiraceae. These data demonstrate that C. difficile colonizationresistance can be restored to a susceptible community with an FCT as long as itcomplements the missing populations. IMPORTANCE Antibiotic use, ubiquitous withthe health care environment, is a major risk factor for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI), the most common nosocomial infection. When C. difficile becomes resistant to antibiotics, a fecal microbiota transplant from a healthy individualcan effectively restore the gut bacterial community and eliminate the infection. While this relationship between the gut bacteria and CDI is well established,there are no therapies to treat a perturbed gut community to prevent CDI. Thisstudy explored the potential of restoring colonization resistance toantibiotic-induced susceptible gut communities. We described the effect that gut bacterial community variation has on the effectiveness of a fecal communitytransplant for inhibiting CDI. These data demonstrated that communitiessusceptible to CDI can be supplemented with fecal communities but that theeffectiveness depended on the structure of the community following theperturbation. Thus, a reduced bacterial community may be able to recovercolonization resistance in patients treated with antibiotics.

TI  - Cysteinyl Maresins Reprogram Macrophages to Protect Mice from Streptococcuspneumoniae after Influenza A Virus Infection.
PG  - e0126722
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01267-22 [doi]
AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) infections are a leading cause of mortality worldwide.Excess mortality during IAV epidemics and pandemics is attributable to secondary bacterial infections, particularly pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Resident alveolar macrophages (rAMs) are early responders to respiratoryinfections that coordinate initial host defense responses. Maresin conjugates in tissue regeneration (MCTRs) are recently elucidated cysteinyl maresins that areproduced by and act on macrophages. Roles for MCTRs in responses to respiratoryinfections remain to be determined. Here, IAV infection led to transientdecreases in rAM numbers. Repopulated lung macrophages displayed transcriptional alterations 21 days post-IAV with prolonged susceptibility to secondarypneumococcal infection. Administration of a mix of MCTR1 to 3 or MCTR3 alonepost-IAV decreased lung inflammation and bacterial load 48 and 72 h aftersecondary pneumococcal infection. MCTR-exposed rAMs had increased migration andphagocytosis of Streptococcus pneumoniae, reduced secretion of CXCL1, and areversion toward baseline levels of several IAV-induced pneumonia susceptibility genes. Together, MCTRs counter regulated post-IAV changes in rAMs to promote arapid return of bacteria host defense. IMPORTANCE Secondary bacterial pneumoniais a serious and common complication of IAV infection, leading to excessmorbidity and mortality. New host-directed approaches are needed to complementantibiotics to better address this important global infectious disease. Here, we show that harnessing endogenous resolution mechanisms for inflammation byexogenous administration of a family of specialized proresolving mediators (i.e.,cys-MCTRs) increased macrophage resilience mechanisms after IAV to protectagainst secondary infection from Streptococcus pneumoniae.

AB  - Cellulose being the most abundant polysaccharide on earth, beta-glucosidaseshydrolyzing cello-oligosaccharides are key enzymes to fuel glycolysis inmicroorganisms developing on plant material. In Streptomyces scabiei, thecausative agent of common scab in root and tuber crops, a genetic compensationphenomenon safeguards the loss of the gene encoding the cello-oligosaccharidehydrolase BglC by awakening the expression of alternative beta-glucosidases.Here, we revealed that the BglC compensating enzyme BcpE2 was the GH3-familybeta-glucosidase that displayed the highest reported substrate promiscuity andwas able to release the glucose moiety of all tested types of plant-derivedheterosides (aryl beta-glucosides, monolignol glucosides, cyanogenic glucosides, anthocyanosides, and coumarin heterosides). BcpE2 structure analysis highlighted a large cavity in the PA14 domain that covered the active site, and the highflexibility of this domain would allow proper adjustment of this cavity fordisparate heterosides. The exceptional substrate promiscuity of BcpE2 providesmicroorganisms a versatile tool for scavenging glucose from plant-derivednutrients that widely vary in size and structure. Importantly, scopolin was theonly substrate commonly hydrolyzed by both BglC and BcpE2, thereby generating thepotent virulence inhibitor scopoletin. Next to fueling glycolysis, both enzymeswould also fine-tune the strength of virulence. IMPORTANCE Plant decaying biomassis the most abundant provider of carbon sources for soil-dwelling microorganisms.To optimally evolve in such environmental niches, microorganisms possess anarsenal of hydrolytic enzymatic complexes to feed on the various types ofpolysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and monosaccharides. In this work, structural,enzymatic, and expression studies revealed the existence of a "swiss-army knife" enzyme, BcpE2, that was able to retrieve the glucose moiety of a multitude ofplant-derived substrates that vary in size, structure, and origin. This enzymewould provide the microorganisms with a tool that would allow them to findnutrients from any type of plant-derived material.

TI  - Phosphoglucose Isomerase Is Important for Aspergillus fumigatus Cell WallBiogenesis.
PG  - e0142622
LID - 10.1128/mbio.01426-22 [doi]
AB  - Aspergillus fumigatus is a devastating opportunistic fungal pathogen causinghundreds of thousands of deaths every year. Phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) is aglycolytic enzyme that converts glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, akey precursor of fungal cell wall biosynthesis. Here, we demonstrate that thegrowth of A. fumigatus is repressed by the deletion of pgi, which can be rescued by glucose and fructose supplementation in a 1:10 ratio. Even under theseoptimized growth conditions, the Deltapgi mutant exhibits severe cell walldefects, retarded development, and attenuated virulence in Caenorhabditis elegansand Galleria mellonella infection models. To facilitate exploitation of A.fumigatus PGI as an antifungal target, we determined its crystal structure,revealing potential avenues for developing inhibitors, which could potentially beused as adjunctive therapy in combination with other systemic antifungals.IMPORTANCE Aspergillus fumigatus is an opportunistic fungal pathogen causingdeadly infections in immunocompromised patients. Enzymes essential for fungalsurvival and cell wall biosynthesis are considered potential drug targets againstA. fumigatus. PGI catalyzes the second step of the glycolysis pathway, linkingglycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway. As such, PGI has been widelyconsidered as a target for metabolic regulation and therefore a therapeutictarget against hypoxia-related diseases. Our study here reveals that PGI isimportant for A. fumigatus survival and exhibit pleiotropic functions, including development, cell wall glucan biosynthesis, and virulence. We also solved thecrystal structure of PGI, thus providing the genetic and structural groundworkfor the exploitation of PGI as a potential antifungal target.

TI  - LPS O Antigen Plays a Key Role in Klebsiella pneumoniae Capsule Retention.
PG  - e0151721
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01517-21 [doi]
AB  - Despite the importance of encapsulation in bacterial pathogenesis, thebiochemical mechanisms and forces that underpin retention of capsule byencapsulated bacteria are poorly understood. In Gram-negative bacteria, there maybe interactions between lipopolysaccharide (LPS) core and capsule polymers,between capsule polymers with retained acyl carriers and the outer membrane, and in some bacteria, between the capsule polymers and Wzi, an outer membrane proteinlectin. Our transposon studies in Klebsiella pneumoniae B5055 identifiedadditional genes that, when insertionally inactivated, resulted in reducedencapsulation. Inactivation of the gene waaL, which encodes the ligaseresponsible for attaching the repeated O antigen of LPS to the LPS core, resultedin a significant reduction in capsule retention, measured by atomic forcemicroscopy. This reduction in encapsulation was associated with increasedsensitivity to human serum and decreased virulence in a murine model ofrespiratory infection and, paradoxically, with increased biofilm formation. Thecapsule in the WaaL mutant was physically smaller than that of the Wzi mutant of K. pneumoniae B5055. These results suggest that interactions between surfacecarbohydrate polymers may enhance encapsulation, a key phenotype in bacterialvirulence, and provide another target for the development of antimicrobials that may avoid resistance issues associated with growth inhibition. IMPORTANCEBacterial capsules, typically comprised of complex sugars, enable pathogens toavoid key host responses to infection, including phagocytosis. These capsules aresynthesized within the bacteria, exported through the outer envelope, and thensecured to the external surface of the organism by a force or forces that areincompletely described. This study shows that in the important hospital pathogen Klebsiella pneumoniae, the polysaccharide capsule is retained by interactionswith other surface sugars, especially the repeated sugar molecule of the LPSmolecule in Gram-negative bacteria known as "O antigen." This O antigen is joinedto the LPS molecule by ligation, and loss of the enzyme responsible for ligation,a protein called WaaL, results in reduced encapsulation. Since capsules areessential to the virulence of many pathogens, WaaL might provide a target for newantimicrobial development, critical to the control of pathogens like K.pneumoniae that have become highly drug resistant.

TI  - Bacterial Metabolism and Transport Genes Are Associated with the Preference ofDrosophila melanogaster for Dietary Yeast.
PG  - e0072022
LID - 10.1128/aem.00720-22 [doi]
AB  - Many animal traits are influenced by their associated microorganisms("microbiota"). To expand our understanding of the relationship between microbialgenotype and host phenotype, we report an analysis of the influence of themicrobiota on the dietary preference of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster.First, we confirmed through experiments on flies reared bacteria-free ("axenic") or in monoassociation with two different strains of bacteria that the microbiota significantly influences fruit fly dietary preference across a range of ratios ofdietary yeast:dietary glucose. Then, focusing on microbiota-dependent changes in fly dietary preference for yeast (DPY), we performed a metagenome-wideassociation (MGWA) study to define microbial species specificity for this traitand to predict bacterial genes that influence it. In a subsequent mutantanalysis, we confirmed that disrupting a subset of the MGWA-predicted genesinfluences fly DPY, including for genes involved in thiamine biosynthesis andglucose transport. Follow-up tests revealed that the bacterial influence on flyDPY did not depend on bacterial modification of the glucose or protein content ofthe fly diet, suggesting that the bacteria mediate their effects independent ofthe fly diet or through more specific dietary changes than broad ratios ofprotein and glucose. Together, these findings provide additional insight intobacterial determinants of host nutrition and behavior by revealing specificgenetic disruptions that influence D. melanogaster DPY. IMPORTANCE Associatedmicroorganisms ("microbiota") impact the physiology and behavior of their hosts, and defining the mechanisms underlying these interactions is a major gap in thefield of host-microbe interactions. This study expands our understanding of howthe microbiota can influence dietary preference for yeast (DPY) of a model host, Drosophila melanogaster. First, we show that fly preferences for a range ofdifferent dietary yeast:dietary glucose ratios vary significantly with theidentity of the microbes that colonize the fruit flies. We then performed ametagenome-wide association study to identify candidate bacterial genes thatcontributed to some of these bacterial influences. We confirmed that disruptingsome of the predicted genes, including genes involved in glucose transport andthiamine biosynthesis, resulted in changes to fly DPY and show that the influenceof two of these genes is not through changes in dietary ratios of protein toglucose. Together, these efforts expand our understanding of the bacterialgenetic influences on a feeding behavior of a model animal host.

TI  - Role of RpoS in Regulating Stationary Phase Salmonella TyphimuriumPathogenesis-Related Stress Responses under Physiological Low Fluid Shear ForceConditions.
PG  - e0021022
LID - 10.1128/msphere.00210-22 [doi]
AB  - The discovery that biomechanical forces regulate microbial virulence wasestablished with the finding that physiological low fluid shear (LFS) forcesaltered gene expression, stress responses, and virulence of the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium during the log phase. These log phaseLFS-induced phenotypes were independent of the master stress response regulator, RpoS (sigma(S)). Given the central importance of RpoS in regulatingstationary-phase stress responses of S. Typhimurium cultured under conventionalshake flask and static conditions, we examined its role in stationary-phasecultures grown under physiological LFS. We constructed an isogenic rpoS mutantderivative of wild-type S. Typhimurium and compared the ability of these strains to survive in vitro pathogenesis-related stresses that mimic those encountered inthe infected host and environment. We also compared the ability of these strains to colonize (adhere, invade, and survive within) human intestinal epithelial cellcultures. Unexpectedly, LFS-induced resistance of stationary-phase S. Typhimuriumcultures to acid and bile salts stresses did not rely on RpoS. Likewise, RpoS wasdispensable for stationary-phase LFS cultures to adhere to and survive withinintestinal epithelial cells. In contrast, the resistance of these cultures tochallenges of oxidative and thermal stresses, and their invasion into intestinal epithelial cells was influenced by RpoS. These findings expand our mechanisticunderstanding of how physiological fluid shear forces modulate stationary-phaseS. Typhimurium physiology in unexpected ways and provide clues into microbialmechanobiology and nuances of Salmonella responses to microenvironmental nichesin the infected host. IMPORTANCE Bacterial pathogens respond dynamically to avariety of stresses in the infected host, including physical forces of fluid flow(fluid shear) across their surfaces. While pathogens experience wide fluctuationsin fluid shear during infection, little is known about how these forces regulate microbial pathogenesis. This is especially important for stationary-phasebacterial growth, which is a critical period to understand microbial resistance, survival, and infection potential, and is regulated in many bacteria by thegeneral stationary-phase stress response protein RpoS. Here, we showed that,unlike conventional culture conditions, several stationary-phase Salmonellapathogenic stress responses were not impacted by RpoS when bacteria were culturedunder fluid shear conditions relevant to those encountered in the intestine ofthe infected host. These findings offer new insight into how physiological fluid shear forces encountered by Salmonella during infection might impact pathogenicresponses in unexpected ways that are relevant to their disease-causing ability.

TI  - Repressed Ang 1-7 in COVID-19 Is Inversely Associated with Inflammation andCoagulation.
PG  - e0022022
LID - 10.1128/msphere.00220-22 [doi]
AB  - The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infects host cells by binding to theangiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which belongs to ananti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic counter-regulatory arm of therenin-angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 dysfunction and RAS dysregulation has beenexplored as a driving force in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), butdata from COVID-19 patients has been inconsistent and inconclusive. We sought to identify disruptions of the classical (ACE)/angiotensin (Ang) II/Ang II type-1receptor (AT1R) and the counter-regulatory ACE2/Ang 1-7/Mas Receptor (MasR)pathways in patients with COVID-19 and correlate these with severity of infectionand markers of inflammation and coagulation. Ang II and Ang 1-7 levels in plasma were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for 230 patients, 166 of whom were SARS-CoV-2+. Ang 1-7 was repressed in COVID-19 patients compared to that in SARS-CoV-2 negative outpatient controls. Since the control cohort wasless sick than the SARS-CoV-2+ group, this association between decreased Ang 1-7 and COVID-19 cannot be attributed to COVID-19 specifically as opposed to criticalillness more generally. Multivariable logistic regression analyses demonstratedthat every 10-pg/mL increase in plasma Ang 1-7 was associated with a 3% reductionin the odds of hospitalization (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.97, confidenceinterval [CI] 0.95 to 0.99) and a 3% reduction in odds of requiring oxygensupplementation (AOR 0.97, CI 0.95 to 0.99) and/or ventilation (AOR 0.97, CI 0.94to 0.99). Ang 1-7 was also inversely associated with pro-inflammatory cytokinesand d-dimer in this patient cohort, suggesting that reduced activity in thisprotective counter-regulatory arm of the RAS contributes to the hyper-immuneresponse and diffuse coagulation activation documented in COVID-19. IMPORTANCESevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes a uniquedisease, COVID-19, which ranges in severity from asymptomatic to causing severerespiratory failure and death. Viral transmission throughout the world continues at a high rate despite the development and widespread use of effective vaccines. For those patients who contract COVID-19 and become severely ill, few therapeuticoptions have been shown to provide benefits and mortality rates are high.Additionally, the pathophysiology underlying COVID-19 disease presentation,progression, and severity is incompletely understood. The significance of ourresearch is in confirming the role of renin-angiotensin system dysfunction inCOVID-19 pathogenesis in a large cohort of patients with diverse disease severityand outcomes. Additionally, to our knowledge, this is the first study to pairangiotensin peptide levels with inflammatory and thrombotic markers. These datasupport the role of ongoing clinical trials examining renin-angiotensinsystem-targeted therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19.

TI  - Impacts of polyphenols on laying hens' productivity and egg quality: A review.
LID - 10.1111/jpn.13758 [doi]
AB  - There has been a rapid increase in the world's output of main poultry products(meat and eggs). This reflects customer desire for these high-quality and safeproducts and the comparatively low price. Recently, natural feed additives,plants and products have been increasingly popular in the poultry and livestockindustries to maintain and improve their health and production. Polyphenols are atype of micronutrient that is plentiful in our diet. They are phytochemicals thathave health benefits, notably cardiovascular, cognitive function, antioxidant,anti-mutagenic, anti-inflammatory, antistress, anti-tumour, anti-pathogen,detoxification, growth-promoting and immunomodulating activities. On the otherhand, excessive polyphenol levels have an unclear and sometimes negative impacton gastrointestinal tract health, nutrient digestion, digestive enzyme activity, vitamin, mineral absorption, laying hens performance and egg quality. As aresult, this review illuminated polyphenols' various sources, classifications,biological activities, potential usage restrictions and effects on poultry, layerproductivity and egg external and internal quality.

AB  - Several infections have been associated with motor neuron diseases resemblingALS, including species of viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Mycobacterium aviumsubspecies paratuberculosis (MAP), most known for its probable etiologicassociation with Crohn's disease, has been suggested as another possibleinfectious cause of motor neuron disease. Two published case reports describe thesuccessful treatment of ALS-like symptoms with antimycobacterial antibiotics.Both cases had atypical features. Based on these, we believe it would bereasonable to begin performing chest imaging in PALS who have features of theirhistory or exam that are atypical for ALS such as pain, fevers, or eye movementabnormalities. If the chest imaging is abnormal, more specific testing formycobacteria may be indicated. Until there is more clear evidence of anassociation between mycobacteria and ALS, we cannot endorse the widespread use ofpotentially toxic antimycobacterial antibiotics for PALS.

TI  - Microbiology of surgical site infections (SSIs) following skin cancer surgery.
LID - 10.1111/ans.17957 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUNDS: Surgical site infections (SSIs) represent one of the most common andpotentially preventable sources of morbidity and healthcare cost escalationassociated with skin cancer surgery. There is a lack of data reporting organisms cultured from SSIs in skin surgery, with guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxisbased on common skin pathogens rather than actual cultured organisms. In thisstudy, we sought to define the cultured microbiology of SSIs specific to skincancer surgery and test these against empiric treatment guidelines. METHODS: All consenting patients presenting to the Auckland regional skin cancer treatmentcentre over a 6-month period were included. Patients receiving any form ofantibiotics within a week prior to surgery were excluded. All wounds wereassessed postoperatively, with clinically significant infections identified asthose with a standardized wound infection score of 4 (range 0-7) and/orprescribed post-operative antibiotics within 3 weeks of surgery. Wound cultureswere recorded. RESULTS: About 104 clinically significant SSIs were identifiedfrom 333 lesions treated, with cultures available in 27%. Cultured organismsincluded MSSA (79%), MRSA (14%), coagulase-negative Staphylococci (11%), and'skin flora' (14%). Empiric guidelines inaccurately predicted effective treatmentin 14% of cases, exclusively due to MRSA. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge this isthe first comprehensive report of SSI microbiology following skin cancer surgery.The overwhelmingly predominant organisms were Staphylococcus sp. (76%), with the rate of MRSA approaching prevalence warranting empiric first-line treatment.These data help inform effective rationalized empiric antibiotic treatment, when indicated, for optimal outcome following skin surgery.

TI  - Dimensionality reduction boosts the peroxidase-like activity of bimetallic MOFsfor enhanced multidrug-resistant bacteria eradication.
LID - 10.1039/d2nr02828j [doi]
AB  - The antibacterial strategy using cutting-edge metal-organic framework (MOF)-basednanozymes can effectively solve the problem caused by antibiotic resistance toprotect human health and the environment; however it has been significantlylimited by the complicated modification method and non-ideal catalytic activity. Herein, we report a facile dimensionality-reduction strategy to improve thecatalytic activity of MOF-based nanozymes. By reducing the dimensionality oftwo-dimensional Co-TCPP(Fe) (Co-Fe NSs) to zero-dimensional Co-TCPP(Fe) (Co-FeNDs), the peroxidase-like activity of the prepared bimetallic Co-Fe NDs wasalmost tripled. Consequently, the bimetallic Co-Fe NDs can highly efficientlycatalyze the lower-concentration H2O2 into reactive oxygen species (ROS),resulting in a favorable antibacterial effect against methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Meanwhile, Co-Fe NDs can effectively promote wound healing and water environment disinfection with good biocompatibility. This work reveals the potential of a zero-dimensional bimetallic MOF-based nanozyme inresisting drug-resistant bacteria and holds great promise for future clinical andenvironmental applications.

TI  - Polymer-induced biofilms for enhanced biocatalysis.
LID - 10.1039/d2mh00607c [doi]
AB  - The intrinsic resilience of biofilms to environmental conditions makes them anattractive platform for biocatalysis, bioremediation, agriculture or consumerhealth. However, one of the main challenges in these areas is that beneficialbacteria are not necessarily good at biofilm formation. Currently, this problemis solved by genetic engineering or experimental evolution, techniques that canbe costly and time consuming, require expertise in molecular biology and/ormicrobiology and, more importantly, are not suitable for all types ofmicroorganisms or applications. Here we show that synthetic polymers can be used as an alternative, working as simple additives to nucleate the formation ofbiofilms. Using a combination of controlled radical polymerization and dynamiccovalent chemistry, we prepare a set of synthetic polymers carrying mildlycationic, aromatic, heteroaromatic or aliphatic moieties. We then demonstratethat hydrophobic polymers induce clustering and promote biofilm formation inMC4100, a strain of Escherichia coli that forms biofilms poorly, with aromaticand heteroaromatic moieties leading to the best performing polymers. Moreover, wecompare the effect of the polymers on MC4100 against PHL644, an E. coli strainthat forms biofilms well due to a single point mutation which increasesexpression of the adhesin curli. In the presence of selected polymers, MC4100 canreach levels of biomass production and curli expression similar or higher thanPHL644, demonstrating that synthetic polymers promote similar changes inmicrobial physiology than those introduced following genetic modification.Finally, we demonstrate that these polymers can be used to improve theperformance of MC4100 biofilms in the biocatalytic transformation of5-fluoroindole into 5-fluorotryptophan. Our results show that incubation withthese synthetic polymers helps MC4100 match and even outperform PHL644 in thisbiotransformation, demonstrating that synthetic polymers can underpin thedevelopment of beneficial applications of biofilms.

LID - 10.1080/15592294.2022.2105033 [doi]
AB  - Few recurrent DNA mutations are seen in aggressive canine B cell lymphomas(cBCL), suggesting other frequent drivers. The methylated island recovery assay(MIRA-seq) or methylated CpG-binding domain sequencing (MBD-seq) was used todefine the genome-wide methylation profiles in aggressive cBCL in GoldenRetrievers to determine if cBCL can be better defined by epigenetic changes than by DNA mutations. DNA hypermethylation patterns were relatively homogenous withincBCL samples in Golden Retrievers, in different breeds and in geographicalregions. Aberrant hypermethylation is thus suspected to be a central and earlyevent in cBCL lymphomagenesis. Distinct subgroups within cBCL in GoldenRetrievers were not identified with DNA methylation profiles. In comparison, the methylome profile of human DLBCL (hDLBCL) is relatively heterogeneous. Onlymoderate similarity between hDLBCL and cBCL was seen and cBCL likely cannot beaccurately classified into the subtypes seen in hDLBCL. Genes withhypermethylated regions in the promoter-TSS-first exon of cBCL compared to normalB cells often also had additional hyper- and hypomethylated regions distributedthroughout the gene suggesting non-randomized repeat targeting of key genes byepigenetic mechanisms. The prevalence of hypermethylation in transcription factorfamilies in aggressive cBCL may represent a fundamental step in lymphomagenesis.

TI  - Roles of phosphatidylserine and phospholipase C in the activation of TOR complex 2 signaling in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
LID - jcs.259988 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jcs.259988 [doi]
AB  - The target of rapamycin (TOR) forms two distinct complexes, TORC1 and TORC2, toexert its functions essential for cellular growth and homeostasis. TORC1signaling is regulated in response to nutrients such as amino acids and glucose; however, the mechanisms underlying the activation of TORC2 signaling are stillpoorly understood compared to TORC1 signaling. In the budding yeast Saccharomycescerevisiae, TORC2 targets protein kinases Ypk1, Ypk2, and Pkc1 forphosphorylation. Plasma membrane stress is known to activate the TORC2-Ypk1/2signaling. We have previously reported that methylglyoxal (MG), a metabolitederived from glycolysis, activates TORC2-Pkc1 signaling. In this study, we found that MG activates the TORC2-Ypk1/2 and TORC2-Pkc1 signaling, and thatphosphatidylserine is involved in the activation of both signaling pathways. Wealso demonstrated that the Rho-family GTPase Cdc42 contributes to the plasmamembrane stress-induced activation of TORC2-Ypk1/2 signaling. Furthermore, werevealed that phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, Plc1, contributes tothe activation of both TORC2-Ypk1/2 and TORC2-Pkc1 signaling.

TI  - A Flexible Anti-Biofilm Hygiene Coating for Water Devices.
LID - 10.1021/acsabm.2c00538 [doi]
AB  - Biofilm is a microbiome complex comprising different bacterial colonies thattypically adhere to device surfaces in water, which causes serious medical issuessuch as indwelling infections and outbreaks. Here, we developed anon-nanoparticle, flexible anti-biofilm hygiene coating consisting of lithocholicacid (LCA), zinc pyrithione (Zn), and cinnamaldehyde (Cn) (named as LCA-Zn-Cn)that largely prevents the bacteria adhesion to various water device surfaces suchas stainless steel and glass through a synergistic mechanism. The existingchelated groups on LCA and Cn attract plenty of bacteria via hydrophobicinteraction. Both the bactericidal reaction by grafting biocidal groups from bothLCA and Cn and the bacteriostatic reaction by inhibiting cell division via zincions (Zn) lead to a largely improved bacteria/biofilm prevention. Theantibacterial performance was assessed by using the JIS Z 2801/ISO 22196 method. The designed LCA-Zn-Cn coating displayed log10 reduction of 4.23 (99.9%reduction) of E. coli and log10 reduction of 3.51 (99.8% reduction) of E.faecalis on stainless steel, which are much higher than the control samples,demonstrating a promising colonization inhibition. In parallel, the polysulfoneencapsulated beads also showed >99% reduction efficiency in batch and >97-98%reduction efficiency in continuous column tests using the Lake Michigan water.Due to the strong cross-linked configuration, the coating still showed >90.9%bacterial reduction after 3000 abrasion cycles and over 99.9% bacteria reduction after a high flow velocity of 1.99 m/s test, which confirmed the enhancedmechanical durability. By applying either spray or dip-coating, the designedpolymer composite can be coated on a variety of irregular water devices with massproduction using an auto-controlled robot arm.

TI  - Assessment of exposure to dust, gaseous pollutants and endotoxins in sewagetreatment plants of Ahmedabad city, India.
LID - 10.3233/WOR-205208 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sewage treatment plant workers (STPs) are exposed to gaseouspollutants (H2S) and bioaerosols and their health is at risk. METHODS: Gaseouspollutants and bioaerosols (inhalable dust, 1,3 beta D-glucans and endotoxins)were evaluated in two sewage treatment plants (STPs) of Ahmedabad city, India.The concentration of H2S, CO, CH4 and Cl2 were monitored in two process areas of STPs using real-time gas detectors. The dust, 1,3 beta D-glucans and endotoxinswere evaluated as per standard methods. RESULTS: The mean concentration of H2Sexceeded the permissible exposure limit of 10 ppm, whereas the concentration ofother gaseous pollutants (CO, Cl2 and CH4) were below the permissible exposurelimits of Indian Factories Act, 1948. The inhalable dust concentration was alsowithin the permissible exposure limit of 10 mg/m3 as per Indian Factories Act,1948. CONCLUSIONS: Significant exposures to gaseous and bioaerosols were found inthe work environment of STPs. The paired t-test result showed a significantdifference between two STPs for H2S, 1,3 beta D-Glucans and endotoxins. STPs wereadvised to reduce the exposure to H2S and bioaerosols as per CPCB guidelinesapplicable to India to prevent health effects.

TI  - Progenitor with cardiometabolic disorders increases food intake, systemicinflammation and gut microbiota alterations in the second-generation offspring.
LID - 10.1039/d1fo02838c [doi]
AB  - This work presents the effects of the high-fat diet (H) consumed by theprogenitor (G0) on cardiometabolic disorders and intestinal microbiota in thesecond-generation offspring (F2). The rats submitted to H (G0H) or control (C)(G0C) diets, during mating, gestation and lactation, generated F2 offspring(F2-G0H and F2-G0C, respectively), which received only the C diet. Both, G0H and F2-G0H, showed changes in the intestinal microbiota, increased MAP, plasma TAGlevels, adiposity index and the inflammatory process in retroperitoneal fat andin the colon shown by increased TNF-alpha, MCP-1, MyD88 and CAV-1 geneexpression. In addition, F2-G0H showed increased food intake, leptin resistance, total cholesterol and plasma levels of MCP-1 and reduced adiponectin. Regardingmicrobial communities, a greater diversity was observed in 5 unique families ofbacteria that was correlated with cardiometabolic disorders. Overall, progenitorswith cardiometabolic disorders induce an increase in food intake, systemicinflammation and microbiota alterations in the F2-G0H offspring.

AB  - The development of new materials for food packaging applications is necessary to reduce the excessive use of disposable plastics and their environmental impact.Biodegradable polymers represent an alternative means of mitigating the problem. To add value to biodegradable materials and to enhance food preservation, theincorporation of active compounds into the polymer matrix is an affordablestrategy. Phenolic acids are plant metabolites that can be found in multipleplant extracts and exhibit antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Comparedwith other natural active compounds, such as essential oils, phenolic acids donot present a high sensorial impact while exhibiting similar minimal inhibitoryconcentrations against different bacteria. This study summarizes and discussesrecent studies about the potential of both phenolic acids/plant extracts andbiodegradable polymers as active food packaging materials, their properties,interactions, and the factors that could affect their antimicrobial efficiency.The molecular structure of phenolic acids greatly affects their potentialantioxidant and antimicrobial capacity, as well as their specific interactionswith polymer matrices and food substrates. These interactions, in turn, can lead to plasticizing or cross-linking effects. In the present study, the antioxidantand antimicrobial properties of different biodegradable films with phenolic acidshave been described, as well as the main factors affecting the active properties of these films as useful materials for active packaging development. More studiesapplying these active materials in real foods are required.

AB  - The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic provokes scientists to make a promptdevelopment of new effective therapeutic interventions for the battle againstSARS-CoV-2. A new series of N-(5-nitrothiazol-2-yl)-carboxamido derivatives were designed and synthesised based on the structural optimisation principle of theSARS-CoV Mpro co-crystallized WR1 inhibitor. Notably, compound 3b achieved themost promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity with an IC50 value of 174.7 microg/mL. Onthe other hand, compounds 3a, 3b, and 3c showed very promising SARS-CoV-2 Mproinhibitory effects with IC50 values of 4.67, 5.12, and 11.90 microg/mL,respectively. Compound 3b docking score was very promising (-6.94 kcal/mol) andits binding mode was nearly similar to that of WR1. Besides, the moleculardynamics (MD) simulations of compound 3b showed its great stability inside thebinding pocket until around 40 ns. Finally, a very promising SAR was concluded tohelp to design more powerful SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors shortly.

AB  - Invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) cells are unconventional T cells that respondto glycolipid antigens found in microbes in a CD1d-dependent manner. iNKT cellsexert innate-like functions and produce copious amounts of cytokines, chemokines and cytotoxic molecules within only minutes of activation. As such, iNKT cellscan fuel or dampen inflammation in a context-dependent manner. In addition, iNKT cells provide potent immunity against bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi.Although microbiota-iNKT cell interactions are not well-characterized, mountingevidence suggests that microbiota colonization early in life impacts iNKT cellhomeostasis and functions in disease. In this study, we showed that CD1d(-/-) andValpha14 Tg mice, which lack and have increased numbers of iNKT cells,respectively, had no significant alterations in gut microbiota compositioncompared to their littermate controls. Furthermore, specific iNKT cell activationby glycolipid antigens only resulted in a transient and minimal shift inmicrobiota composition when compared to the natural drift found in our colony.Our findings demonstrate that iNKT cells have little to no influence inregulating commensal bacteria at steady state.Abbreviations: iNKT: invariantNatural Killer T cell; alphaGC: alpha-galactosylceramide.

TI  - A lipopolysaccharide-dependent phage infects a pseudomonad phytopathogen and can evolve to evade phage resistance.
LID - 10.1111/1462-2920.16106 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial pathogens are major causes of crop diseases, leading to significantproduction losses. For instance, kiwifruit canker, caused by the phytopathogenPseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa), has posed a global challenge tokiwifruit production. Treatment with copper and antibiotics, whilst initiallyeffective, is leading to the rise of bacterial resistance, requiring newbiocontrol approaches. Previously, we isolated a group of closely related Psaphages with biocontrol potential, which represent environmentally sustainableantimicrobials. However, their deployment as antimicrobials requires furtherinsight into their properties and infection strategy. Here, we provide anin-depth examination of the genome of PhiPsa374-like phages and show that theyuse lipopolysaccharides (LPS) as their main receptor. Through proteomics andcryo-electron microscopy of PhiPsa374, we revealed the structural proteome andthat this phage possess a T = 9 capsid triangulation, unusual for myoviruses.Furthermore, we show that PhiPsa374 phage resistance arises in planta throughmutations in a glycosyltransferase involved in LPS synthesis. Lastly, through in vitro evolution experiments we showed that phage resistance is overcome bymutations in a tail fibre and structural protein of unknown function inPhiPsa374. This study provides new insight into the properties of PhiPsa374-like phages that informs their use as antimicrobials against Psa.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of low intensity (0.1-0.8Watt/cm(2)) pulsed ultrasound on chondrocyte cell proliferation and migration.METHODS: Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (frequency 3 MHz, duty cycle 25%, andpulse repetition frequency 150 Hz) for 5 minutes at different spatial averageintensities was applied on chondrocyte cells. First, the optimum dose withsignificantly increased proliferation was determined to be 0.5 W/cm(2) for 5minutes of duration. Then, 0.5 W/cm(2) ultrasound intensity was applied fordurations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 minutes, and healing was assessed by monitoring cell migration and proliferation. RESULTS: At the intensity of 0.5 W/cm(2) 48hours after the application, a statistically significant increase inproliferation (p = .0089) was observed in chondrocyte cells compared to thecontrol group. Proliferation was analyzed at 4, 8, 24, and 48 hours afterapplying 0.5 W/cm(2) ultrasound for durations of 2.5, 5, 7.5, and 10 minutes.Statistically significant increases were observed at 4 hours (p = .009), 8 hours (p = .032), 24 hours (p = .0084), and 48 hours (p = .00098) with 10 minutes ofexposure. For 7.5 min of exposure duration, significant increases were observedat 48 hours (p = .045). In migration for all parameters, no statisticallysignificant improvement (p > .05) was observed. CONCLUSION: It was shown that lowintensity pulsed ultrasound induces cartilage cell proliferation; therefore, itmay have a disease-modifying effect in the treatment of osteoarthritis. However, no positive effect was observed on cartilage cell migration.

AB  - Enterococci represent a significant part of the non-starter LAB microbiota ofartisanal cheeses produced mainly from raw milk. Common approaches to safetyevaluation of enterococci isolates include assessment of antimicrobial resistanceand virulence potential. Hence, a collection of 47 (n = 22, Serbia; n = 25,Slovenia) dairy enterococcal isolates, of which E. faecalis (n = 28), E. faecium (n = 11), E. durans (n = 5), E. casseliflavus (n = 2), and E. gallinarum (n = 1),was analyzed. The susceptibility to 12 antimicrobials was tested using a brothmicrodilution method, and the presence of the selected antimicrobial resistanceand virulence genes was investigated using PCR. Isolates were resistant totetracycline (TET) (25.5%), erythromycin (ERY) (17.0%), gentamycin andchloramphenicol (CHL) ( approximately 6%). No resistance to ampicillin (AMP),ciprofloxacin (CIP), daptomycin (DAP), linezolid (LZD), teicoplanin (TEI),tigecycline (TGC) and vancomycin (VAN) was detected. Among all the resistancedeterminants analyzed, ermB gene was detected most frequently. All 10 virulencegenes analyzed were detected with a distribution of cpd (72.3%), cob and ccf(70.2%), gelE (68.1%), hyl (59.6%), agg (53.2%) and esp (46.8%). The genesencoding cytolysin (cylA, cylM and cylB) were amplified to a lesser extent(21.3%, 21.3% and 12.8%, respectively). However, due to the limited number ofenterococci isolates analyzed in the present study, further studies are stillrequired in order to better document the safety status of dairy enterococci.

AB  - Drug-resistant bacteria are caused by antibiotic abuse and/or biofilm formationand have become a threat to the food industry. Carbon dot (CD)-basednanomaterials are a very promising tools for combating pathogenic and spoilagebacteria, and they possess exceptional and adjustable photoelectric and chemical properties. In view of the rapid development of CD-based nanomaterials and their increasing popularity in the food industry, a comprehensive and updated review isneeded to summarize their antimicrobial mechanisms and applications in foods.This review discusses the synthesis of CDs, antimicrobial mechanisms, and theirapplications for extending the shelf life of food. It includes the synthesis ofCDs using small molecules, polymers, and biomass. It also discusses the differentantimicrobial mechanisms of CDs and their use as antibacterial agents andcarriers/ligands. CD-based materials have proven effective against pathogenic andspoilage bacteria in food by inhibiting planktonic bacteria and biofilms.Optimization of the production parameters of CDs can help them achieve afull-spectral response, but degradability still requires further research.

TI  - Contact-Lens-Associated Keratitis-An Often Underestimated Risk.
LID - 10.3238/arztebl.m2022.0281 [doi]
LID - arztebl.m2022.0281 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Millions of people in Germany wear contact lenses every day.Deficient contactlens hygiene can lead to corneal infection.Contact-lens-associated keratitis usually has a highly acute presentation and cancause long-term visual loss. METHODS: This review is based on pertinentpublications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed, as well as on relevantmeta-analyses, Cochrane reviews, and reports by national and international healthcare authorities. RESULTS: 23-94% of contact-lens wearers report associateddiscomfort and eye problems. The annual incidence of contact-lens-associatedkeratitis is 2-4/10 000. It is due to bacteria in 90% of cases, and much lesscommonly to acanthamoebae and fungi. The pathogens generally arrive with thecontact lens on the surface of the eye and can penetrate into the corneal tissue because the tear film under the lens is not swept away from the ocular surface bythe eyelids, and corneal epithelial changes are often present as well. Cornealinfiltration that is diagnosed early is often self-limited, but advancedbacterial infection usually requires intense topical antibiotic treatment. Somesevere infections can only be eradicated by emergency corneal transplantation;this is the case in 20-30 % of fungal and acanthamoebic infections. CONCLUSION:The wearing of contact lenses, particularly soft ones, is associated with a risk of microbial keratitis if proper contact-lens hygiene is not exercised.Contact-lens-associated keratitis very rarely causes permanent damage to eyesight(0.6 cases per 10 000 contact-lens wearers per year). The use of contact lensesalways calls for meticulous care.

PG  - 4427804
LID - 10.1155/2022/4427804 [doi]
AB  - Onosma roots are widely used in traditional medicine to treat various diseasesthroughout the world. In this study, for the first time, we investigated thecomponent composition and biological activity of various extracts from the roots of Onosma gmelinii collected in the highlands of the Kakpakty Mountains of theAlmaty region (Republic of Kazakhstan). Extracts were obtained by three differentmethods: percolation extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction, andsupercritical carbon dioxide extraction. The component composition of theextracts was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS),naphthoquinones by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and spectrophotometricmethod. In this study, the presence of shikonin and its derivatives in theextracts was confirmed. The concentration of naphthoquinones during CO2extraction was about 40%, during ultrasonic extraction about 3%, and duringpercolation extraction about 1.3%. The GC-MS method identified 69 chemicalcompounds in the ultrasonic extract, 46 compounds in the CO2 extract, and 51compounds in the percolation extract. The extracts were tested on a panel ofbacteria and viruses: two Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 8739,Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027); nine Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcusaureus ATCC 6538-P, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC BAA-39, Staphylococcus epidermidisATCC 51625, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC19615, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC BAA-660, Enterococcus hirae ATCC 10541,Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 51575, Enterococcus faecium ATCC 700221); and twofungal species (Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Candida albicans ATCC 2091); fivesubtypes of influenza virus A (A/FPV/Weybridge/78 (H7N7), A/Swine/Iowa/15/30(H1N1), A/black-headed gull/Atyrau/743/04 (H13N6), A/FPV/Rostock/1934 (H7N1),A/Almaty/8/98 (H3N2)). The root extracts of Onosma gmelinii showed antibacterial activity in different degrees against all tested Gram-positive bacterial strains,while no inhibitory effect on Gram-negative bacteria was observed. The resultsindicated that the ultrasonic extract effectively inhibits the growth of themajority of tested Gram-positive bacteria (MBC from 18.3 to 293.0 microg/mL). CO2extract had the greatest bactericidal activity (MBC from 0.1 to 24.4 microg/mL). Percolation extract insignificantly inhibited bacterial growth (MBC from 2343.8to 4687.5 microg/mL). CO2 extract and ultrasonic extract significantly reducedthe activity of C. albicans. The results of the antiviral action showed that the ultrasonic extract has the greatest effectiveness against different subtypes ofthe influenza virus A, while other extracts did not show significant activity.

AB  - Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease caused by Brucella spp. When complicated,Brucella may affect any organ system, including the genitourinary system in theform of epidydimo-orchitis. Brucella orchitis is the second most common form ofcomplicated brucellosis. The present case is for an adolescent who is otherwisehealthy but presented with right testicular pain. Ultrasound imaging showedheterogeneous enlarged right testis with large heterogeneous mass and centralnecrosis. alpha-fetoprotein was normal and beta-human choriogonadotropin wasnegative. Malignancy and tuberculosis were excluded based on histopathology andmicrobiology of the tissue biopsy, respectively. The history of raw dairyconsumption and positive serology for B. melitensis and B. abortus establishedthe diagnosis of Brucella epidydimo-orchitis. Treatment was successful withdoxycycline and rifampin for four weeks. In pediatrics, it is important to ruleout malignancy and make every attempt to avoid orchidectomy by making necessaryinvestigations and involving infectious diseases consultation.

AB  - Background: Pyroptosis has been demonstrated to be an inflammatory form ofprogrammed cell death recently. However, the expression of pyroptosis-relatedgenes (PRGs) in colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and their correlations with prognosisremain unclear. Methods: Data of COAD patients were obtained from The CancerGenome Atlas (TCGA) database to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs).Univariate Cox regression analysis and the LASSO Cox regression analysis wereapplied to construct a gene signature. All COAD patients in TCGA cohort wereseparated into low-risk subgroup or high-risk subgroup via the risk score.Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves were adopted to assess its prognostic efficiency. COAD data from the GSE17537datasets was used for validation. A prognostic nomogram was established topredict individual survival. The correlation between PRGs and immune cellinfiltration in COAD was verified based on TIMER database. CIBERSORT analysis wasutilized on risk subgroup as defined by model. The protein and mRNA expressionlevel of PRGs were verified by HPA database and qPCR. Results: A total of 51differentially expressed PRGs were identified in TCGA cohort. Through univariate Cox regression analysis and LASSO Cox regression analysis, a prognostic modelcontaining 7 PRGs was constructed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients in the low-risk subgroup exhibited better prognosis compared to those inthe high-risk subgroup. Additionally, the area under the curve (AUC) of ROC is0.60, 0.63, and 0.73 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival in TCGA cohort and 0.63,0.65, and 0.64 in validation set. TIMER database showed a strong correlationbetween 7 PRGs and tumor microenvironment in COAD. Moreover, CIBERSORT showedsignificant differences in the infiltration of plasma cells, M0 macrophages,resting dendritic cells, and eosinophils between low-risk subgroup and high-risk subgroup. HPA database showed that protein expression level of SDHB, GZMA, BTK,EEF2K, and NR1H2 was higher in normal tissues. And the transcriptional level ofCASP5, BTK, SDHB, GZMA, and RIPK3 was high in normal tissues. Conclusions: Ourstudy identified a novel PRGs signature that could be used to predict theprognosis of COAD patients, which might provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of COAD patients.

AB  - The human skin hosts millions of bacteria, fungi, archaea, and viruses. Theseskin microbes play a crucial role in human immunological and physiologicalfunctions, as well as the development of skin diseases, including cancer when thebalance between skin commensals and pathogens is interrupted. Due to the linkagesbetween inflammation processes and skin microbes, and viral links to skin cancer,new theories have supported the role a dysbiotic skin microbiome plays in thedevelopment of cancer and cancer treatment-related skin toxicities. This reviewfocuses on the skin microbiome and its role in cancer treatment-related skintoxicities, particularly from chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy.The current literature found changes in the diversity and abundance of the skinmicrobiome during cancer treatments such as radiation therapy, including lowerdiversity of the skin microbiome, an increased Proteobacteria/Firmicutes ratio,and a higher abundance of pathogenic Staphylococcus aureus. These changes may be associated with the development and severity of treatment-related skintoxicities, such as acute radiation dermatitis, hand-foot syndrome inchemotherapy, and immunotherapy-induced rash. Several clinical guidelines haveissued potential interventions (e.g., use of topical corticosteroids,phototherapy, and non-pharmaceutical skin care products) to prevent and treatskin toxicities. The effectiveness of these promising interventions inalleviating treatment-related skin toxicities should be further tested amongcancer patients.

AB  - Chagas disease (CD) is caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, and it isendemic in Central, South America, Mexico and the South of the United States. It is an important cause of early mortality and morbidity, and it is associated withpoverty and stigma. A third of the cases evolve into chronic cardiomyopathy andgastrointestinal disease. The infection is transmitted vertically and byblood/organ donation and can reactivate with immunosuppression. Caseidentification requires awareness and screening programmes targeting thepopulation at risk (women in reproductive age, donors, immunocompromisedpatients). Treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is most effective in theacute phase and prevents progression to chronic phase when given to children.Treating women antenatally reduces but does not eliminate vertical transmission. Treatment is poorly tolerated, contraindicated during pregnancy, and has littleeffect modifying the disease in the chronic phase. Screening is easily performed with serology. Migration has brought the disease outside of the endemiccountries, where the transmission continues vertically and via blood andtissue/organ donations. There are more than 32 million migrants from LatinAmerica living in non-endemic countries. However, the infection is massivelyunderdiagnosed in this setting due to the lack of awareness by patients, healthauthorities and professionals. Blood and tissue donation screening policies have significantly reduced transmission in endemic countries but are not universallyestablished in the non-endemic setting. Antenatal screening is not commonly done.Other challenges include difficulties accessing and retaining patients in thehealthcare system and lack of specific funding for the interventions. Anystrategy must be accompanied by education and awareness campaigns directed topatients, professionals and policy makers. The involvement of patients and their communities is central and key for success and must be sought early and actively.This review proposes strategies to address challenges faced by non-endemiccountries.

AB  - Although, the cecum plays vital roles in absorption of water, electrolytes, andother small molecules, and harbors trillions of commensal bacteria to shape largeintestine immune functions, it is unknown the cecum development potentials atsingle cell level during the very crucial neonatal developmental period. Usingsinge cell RNA-seq and proteomics, we have characterized six major types of cecalcells: undifferentiated cells; immune cells (Ims); cecumocytes (CCs); goblet,Paneth like cells (PLCs), and enteroendocrine cells (EECs) with specific markers.CCs mature with a gradual decrease in proportion of cells; however, Ims developwith a continuing increase in proportion of cells. Meanwhile, goblet and EECcells reduced in proportion of cells from do to d14 or d21; PLCs increased inproportion of cells from d0 to d7 then decreased at d14 and d21. The cellsexhibit specific development and maturation trends controlled by transcriptional factors, ligand-receptor pairs, and other factors. As piglets grow, cecal contentand mucosal microbial diversity increases dramatically with population ofbeneficial microbiota, such as lactobacillus. Moreover, cecal mucosal-associated and cecal content microbiota are positively correlated and both show significant correlation with different types of cecal cells and plasma metabolites. This isthe first presentation of neonatal cecal cell development and maturationnaturally at single cell level with transcript, protein, microbiota andmetabolism perspectives. Furthermore, this study provides an important tool forthe determination of novel interventions in cecal drug delivery and metabolismstudies.

TI  - Jaw bone metastasis from Lung cancer as sole primary source: A systematic review.
PG  - e573-e593
LID - 10.4317/jced.59554 [doi]
AB  - Background: Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Lungcancer metastasis to oral region is very rare. Very few research work has beenconducted till date to analyse the jaw bone metastasis from Lung cancer as theprimary source. The goal of this research was to examine published cases of jawbone metastasis from lung cancer as the sole primary source from 1st December1961 to 31st December 2021 and to learn about their characteristics. Material andMethods: An electronic search of the published English literature was performedin PubMed/ Medline, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Research gate databases, usingkeywords like 'Lung cancer', OR/AND 'Lung carcinoma', OR/AND 'Metastasis', OR/AND'Primary', OR/AND 'Source', OR/AND 'Oral cavity' OR/AND 'Jaw', OR/ AND'Mandible', OR/AND 'Maxilla', OR/ AND 'Temporomandibular joint', OR/ AND'Condyle', OR/ AND 'Ramus', OR/ AND 'Maxillary sinus', AND Initial', OR/ AND'Treatment', OR/AND 'Prognosis', OR/ AND 'Follow-up', OR/AND 'Recurrence', OR/AND 'Survival rate'. We also searched all related journals manually. Referencelist of all articles was also checked. Data extracted were tabulated andsummarized. Results: In total, we found 60 relevant publications with 66 patientsin our research. The prognosis was poor, with a survival time of 1 week to 1.5years. The most prevalent diagnosed metastatic lung cancer to jaw bones wasadenocarcinoma and mandible was the predominant site. Conclusions: Jaw bonemetastasis from lung cancer is rare and has a bad prognosis. Because of theirresemblance to other jaw problems and late clinical signs, these lesions gounnoticed the majority of the time, making detection difficult. More cases needto be published in order to raise awareness of these lesions and gain a betterunderstanding of their characteristics. Key words:Jaw bone, lung cancer,metastasis, primary, prognosis.

PG  - 945724
LID - 10.3389/fmolb.2022.945724 [doi]
AB  - Manganese (Mn) plays a multifaceted role in the survival of pathogenic andsymbiotic bacteria in eukaryotic hosts, and it is also important for free-living bacteria to grow in stressful environments. Previous research has uncoveredcomponents of the bacterial Mn homeostasis systems that control intracellular Mn levels, many of which are important for virulence. Multiple studies have alsoidentified proteins that use Mn once it is inside the cell, including Mn-specificenzymes and enzymes transiently loaded with Mn for protection during oxidativestress. Emerging evidence continues to reveal proteins involved in maintaining Mnhomeostasis, as well as enzymes that can bind Mn. For some of these enzymes, Mnserves as an essential cofactor. For other enzymes, mismetallation with Mn canlead to inactivation or poor activity. Some enzymes may even potentially beregulated by differential metallation with Mn or zinc (Zn). This review focuseson new developments in regulatory mechanisms that affect Mn homeostasis andusage, additional players in Mn import that increase bacterial survival duringpathogenesis, and the interplay between Mn and other metals during Mn-responsive physiological processes. Lastly, we highlight lessons learned from fundamentalresearch that are now being applied to bacterial interactions within largermicrobial communities or eukaryotic hosts.

AB  - The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria acts as an additional diffusionbarrier for solutes and nutrients. It is perforated by outer membrane proteins(OMPs) that function most often as diffusion pores, but sometimes also as partsof larger cellular transport complexes, structural components of the cell wall,or even as enzymes. These OMPs often have large loops that protrude into theextracellular environment, which have promise for biotechnological applicationsand as therapeutic targets. Thus, understanding how modifications to these loops affect OMP stability and folding is critical for their efficient application. In this work, the small outer membrane protein OmpX was used as a model system toquantify the effects of loop insertions on OMP folding and stability. Theinsertions were varied according to both hydrophobicity and size, and theireffects were determined by assaying folding into detergent micelles in vitro bySDS-PAGE and in vivo by isolating the outer membrane of cells expressing theconstructs. The different insertions were also examined in molecular dynamicssimulations to resolve how they affect OmpX dynamics in its native outermembrane. The results indicate that folding of OMPs is affected by both theinsert length and by its hydrophobic character. Small insertions sometimes evenimproved the folding efficiency of OmpX, while large hydrophilic inserts reduced it. All the constructs that were found to fold in vitro could also do so in theirnative environment. One construct that could not fold in vitro was transported tothe OM in vivo, but remained unfolded. Our results will help to improve thedesign and efficiency of recombinant OMPs used for surface display.

AB  - The present study was purported to assess the activities: (i) antibacterial andsynergistic against three types of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that are susceptible to drug resistance and (ii) cytotoxic and synergistic oncolorectal adenocarcinoma cells, of thyme essential oil (TEo) in combination withtetracycline (Tcyc). Chemical composition of thyme essential oil was evaluated bygas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method, antioxidant capacity by2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate (DPPH) assay, antibacterial andsynergistic properties were determined by disk diffusion method and cytotoxicactivity by quantifying viable cells by using3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Thyme essential oil has an elevated antioxidant activity, antibacterial potentialagainst both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, especially on S. aureusand K. pneumoniae at the highest concentration tested (50microL/mL), also having a synergistic effect when combined with tetracycline (50microL/mL TEo with10microg/mL Tcyc). Essential oil-treated cells showed a dose-dependent reduction in colorectal adenocarcinoma cell viability, while combination with tetracycline leads to a significantly attenuated decrease in viability.

TI  - Overexpression of hsa-miR-30a-5p and non-obstructive azoospermia: A case-control study.
PG  - 399-404
LID - 10.18502/ijrm.v20i5.11054 [doi]
AB  - Background: Some previous human and animal studies have supported the idea thatKDM3A down-regulation might be the main cause of male infertility, especially in non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). The regulatory role of micro-RNAs (miRNA) has been investigated in the development of male infertility. Objective: Theexpression level of hsa-miR-30a-5p in azoospermia was evaluated to reveal itspossible association with the etiology of male infertility. Materials andMethods: In this case-control study, 30 men with azoospermia (19 of whom had NOA)were selected as the case individuals, and 11 men with obstructive azoospermia(OA) were selected as control individuals. The best miRNA with the strongestability to target the KDM3A gene was detected via comprehensive bioinformaticsanalysis. Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction was usedto assess the expression level of hsa-miR-30a-5p. After analyzing the data, theexpression level of hsa-miR-30a-5p wascompared between men with NOA and men with OA. Results: The findings supported the idea that hsa-miR-30a-5p is the miRNAwith the best ability to target the KDM3A transcript. The expression analysis of hsa-miR-30a-5p indicated a significant overexpression (p = 0.04) in men with NOA compared to in men with OA. Conclusion: Hsa-miR-30a-5p was overexpressed in menwith NOA compared to in control individuals. Hsa-miR-30a-5p could target theKDM3A transcript and may suppress its expression.

AB  - Since 2019, the coronavirus (COVID-19) has outbroken continuously, spreadinginternationally and threatening the public health. However, it was unknown howthe disorder at the single-cell level was associated with the pathogenesis ofCOVID-19. This study presented the disorders of macrophages, epithelial cells,CD8(+) T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells at the single-cell level in thecourses of COVID-19 and analyzed the immune response to cytokine storm. Compared with the healthy group, patients with COVID-19 had higher proportions ofmacrophages and lower proportions of T and NK cells, especially proportions ofmacrophages and epithelial cells with an increase during patients' conditionsfrom mild to severe. This study suggested that there were high levels ofpro-inflammatory and chemokine expressions in cells of COVID-19 and analyzed cellsubsets to explore its changes and pathways. It was worth noting that severalsubsets of macrophages, epithelial cells, CD8 T cells, and NK cells were involvedin inflammation pathways, including interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling pathway and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway. Moreover, the pathways interactingCOVID-19 and cytokine receptor with each other were remarkably enriched. Inaddition, these cell subsets played important roles in inflammation, and theirabnormal functions may cause COVID-19. In conclusion, this study provided animmune outlook for COVID-19 at the single-cell level and revealed differentpathways in immune response of COVID-19 single cells.

TI  - Host KIR/HLA-C Genotypes Determine HIV-Mediated Changes of the NK Cell Repertoireand Are Associated With Vpu Sequence Variations Impacting Downmodulation ofHLA-C.
PG  - 922252
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.922252 [doi]
AB  - NK cells play a pivotal role in viral immunity, utilizing a large array ofactivating and inhibitory receptors to identify and eliminate virus-infectedcells. Killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) represent a highlypolymorphic receptor family, regulating NK cell activity and determining theability to recognize target cells. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class Imolecules serve as the primary ligand for KIRs. Herein, HLA-C stands out as beingthe dominant ligand for the majority of KIRs. Accumulating evidence indicatedthat interactions between HLA-C and its inhibitory KIR2DL receptors(KIR2DL1/L2/L3) can drive HIV-1-mediated immune evasion and thus may contributeto the intrinsic control of HIV-1 infection. Of particular interest in thiscontext is the recent observation that HIV-1 is able to adapt to host HLA-Cgenotypes through Vpu-mediated downmodulation of HLA-C. However, ourunderstanding of the complex interplay between KIR/HLA immunogenetics, NKcell-mediated immune pressure and HIV-1 immune escape is still limited.Therefore, we investigated the impact of specific KIR/HLA-C combinations on theNK cell receptor repertoire and HIV-1 Vpu protein sequence variations of 122viremic, untreated HIV-1(+) individuals. Compared to 60 HIV-1(-) controls, HIV-1 infection was associated with significant changes within the NK cell receptorrepertoire, including reduced percentages of NK cells expressing NKG2A, CD8, and KIR2DS4. In contrast, the NKG2C(+) and KIR3DL2(+) NK cell sub-populations fromHIV-1(+) individuals was enlarged compared to HIV-1(-) controls. Stratificationalong KIR/HLA-C genotypes revealed a genotype-dependent expansion of KIR2DL1(+)NK cells that was ultimately associated with increased binding affinities betweenKIR2DL1 and HLA-C allotypes. Lastly, our data hinted to a preferential selection of Vpu sequence variants that were associated with HLA-C downmodulation inindividuals with high KIR2DL/HLA-C binding affinities. Altogether, our studyprovides evidence that HIV-1-associated changes in the KIR repertoire of NK cellsare to some extent predetermined by host KIR2DL/HLA-C genotypes. Furthermore,analysis of Vpu sequence polymorphisms indicates that differential KIR2DL/HLA-Cbinding affinities may serve as an additional mechanism how host genetics impact immune evasion by HIV-1.

AB  - The rampant increase in drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) remains a majorchallenge not only for treatment management but also for diagnosis, as well asdrug design and development. Drug-resistant mycobacteria affect the quality oflife owing to the delayed diagnosis and require prolonged treatment with multipleand toxic drugs. The phenotypic modulations defining the immune status of anindividual during tuberculosis are well established. The present study aims toexplore the phenotypic changes of monocytes & dendritic cells (DC) as well astheir subsets across the TB disease spectrum, from latency to drug-sensitive TB(DS-TB) and drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) using traditional immunophenotypic analysisand by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) analysis. Our resultsdemonstrate changes in frequencies of monocytes (classical, CD14(++)CD16(-),intermediate, CD14(++)CD16(+) and non-classical, CD14(+/-)CD16(++)) and dendriticcells (DC) (HLA-DR(+)CD11c(+) myeloid DCs, cross-presentingHLA-DR(+)CD14(-)CD141(+) myeloid DCs and HLA-DR(+)CD14(-)CD16(-)CD11c(-)CD123(+) plasmacytoid DCs) together with elevated Monocyte to Lymphocyte ratios(MLR)/Neutrophil to Lymphocyte ratios (NLR) and alteration of cytokine levelsbetween DS-TB and DR-TB groups. UMAP analysis revealed significant differentialexpression of CD14(+), CD16(+), CD86(+) and CD64(+) on monocytes and CD123(+) on DCs by the DR-TB group. Thus, our study reveals differential monocyte and DCsubset frequencies among the various TB disease groups towards modulating theimmune responses and will be helpful to understand the pathogenicity driven byMycobacterium tuberculosis.

AB  - There are many virulence factors of H. pylori that contribute in diverse ways to gastric disease. Therefore, designing multivalent epitope vaccines against manykey virulence factors virulence factors of H. pylori is a promising strategy tocontrol H. pylori infection. In previous studies, we constructed a multivalentepitope vaccine FVpE against four key virulence factors of H. pylori (Urease,CagA, VacA, and NAP), and oral immunization with the FVpE vaccine plus apolysaccharide adjuvant (PA) containing lycium barbarum polysaccharide andchitosan could provide protection against H. pylori infection in the Mongoliangerbil model. Oral vaccines have many advantages over injected vaccines, such as improved safety and compliance, and easier manufacturing and administration.However, the harsh gastrointestinal (GI) environment, such as gastric acid andproteolytic enzymes, limits the development of oral vaccines to some extent. Oralvaccines need a gastrointestinal delivery system with high safety, low price and promoting vaccine antigen to stimulate immune response in the gastrointestinalmucosa. Lactic acid bacteria are gastrointestinal probiotics that have uniqueadvantages as a delivery system for oral vaccines. In this study, a Mcell-targeting surface display system for L. lactis named plSAM was designed tohelp vaccine antigens to stimulate effective immune responses in thegastrointestinal tract, and a M cell-targeting recombinant L. lactis vaccineLL-plSAM-FVpE was constructed by using the surface display system plSAM.recombinant L. lactis vaccine LL-plSAM-FVpE could secretively express theSAM-FVpE protein and display it on the bacterial surface. Moreover, experimental results confirmed that LL-plSAM-FVpE had an enhanced M cell-targeting property.In addition, LL-plSAM-FVpE had excellent M cell-targeting property to promote thephagocytosis and transport of the antigen SAM-FVpE by gastrointestinal M cells.More importantly, oral immunization of LL-plSAM-FVpE or SAM-FVpE plus PA canstimulate IgG and sIgA antibodies and CD4(+) T cell immune responses against fourvirulence factors of H. pylori (Urease, CagA, VacA, and NAP), thus providingprotective immunity against H. pylori infection in mice. The M cell-targetingrecombinant L. lactis vaccine against various key H. pylori virulence factorscould be a promising vaccine candidate for controlling H. pylori infection.

LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.907481 [doi]
AB  - Marburg virus (MARV) is one of the most harmful zoonotic viruses with deadlyeffects on both humans and nonhuman primates. Because of its severe outbreakswith a high rate of fatality, the world health organization put it as a riskgroup 4 pathogen and focused on the urgent need for the development of effective solutions against that virus. However, up to date, there is no effective vaccine against MARV in the market. In the current study, the complete proteome of MARV(seven proteins) was analyzed for the antigenicity score and the virulence orphysiological role of each protein where we nominated envelope glycoprotein (Gp),Transcriptional activator (VP30), and membrane-associated protein (VP24) as thecandidates for epitope prediction. Following that, a vaccine construct wasdesigned based on CTL, HTL, and BCL epitopes of the selected protein candidatesand to finalize the vaccine construct, several amino acid linkers, beta-defensin adjuvant, and PADRE peptides were incorporated. The generated potential vaccinewas assessed computationally for several properties such as antigenicity,allergenicity, stability, and other structural features where the outcomes ofthese assessments nominated this potential vaccine to be validated for itsbinding affinity with two molecular targets TLR-8 and TLR-4. The binding scoreand the stability of the vaccine-receptor complex, which was deeply studiedthrough molecular docking-coupled dynamics simulation, supported the selection ofour designed vaccine as a putative solution for MARV that should be validatedthrough future wet-lab experiments. Here, we describe the computational approach for designing and analysis of this potential vaccine.

AB  - SARS-CoV2 infection in pregnancy and exposed newborns is poorly known. Weperformed a longitudinal analysis of immune system and determined solublecytokine levels in pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV2 and in their newborns. Women with confirmed SARS-CoV2 infection and their exposed uninfected newbornswere recruited from Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Maranon. Peripheralblood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), cord cells and plasma were collected at birthand 6 months later. Immunophenotyping of natural killer (NK), monocytes andCD4/CD8 T-cells were studied in cryopreserved PBMCs and cord cells bymultiparametric flow cytometry. Up to 4 soluble pro/anti-inflammatory cytokineswere assessed in plasma/cord plasma by ELISA assay. SARS-CoV2-infected mothersand their newborns were compared to matched healthy non-SARS-CoV2-infectedmothers and their newborns. The TNFalpha and IL-10 levels of infected motherswere higher at baseline than those of healthy controls. Infected mothers showedincreased NK cells activation and reduced expression of maturation markers thatreverted after 6 months. They also had high levels of Central Memory and lowEffector Memory CD4-T cell subsets. Additionally, the increased CD4- and CD8-Tcell activation (CD154 and CD38) and exhaustion (TIM3/TIGIT) levels at baselinecompared to controls remained elevated after 6 months. Regarding Treg cells, the levels were lower at infected mothers at baseline but reverted after 6 months. Nonewborn was infected at birth. The lower levels of monocytes, NK and CD4-T cells observed at SARS-CoV2-exposed newborns compared to unexposed controlssignificantly increased 6 months later. In conclusion, SARS-CoV2 infection duringpregnancy shows differences in immunological components that could lead newborns to future clinical implications after birth. However, SARS-CoV2 exposed6-months-old newborns showed no immune misbalance, whereas the infected mothersmaintain increased activation and exhaustion levels in T-cells after 6 months.

AB  - Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are normally born in the thymus and activated insecondary lymphoid tissues to suppress immune responses in the lymph node and at sites of inflammation. Tregs are also resident in various tissues or accumulatein damaged tissues, which are now called tissue Tregs, and contribute tohomeostasis and tissue repair by interacting with non-immune cells. We have shownthat Tregs accumulate in the brain during the chronic phase in a mouse cerebralinfarction model, and these Tregs acquire the characteristic properties of brain Tregs and contribute to the recovery of neurological damage by interacting withastrocytes. However, the mechanism of tissue Treg development is not fullyunderstood. We developed a culture method that confers brain Treg characteristicsin vitro. Naive Tregs from the spleen were activated and efficiently amplified byT-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation in the presence of primary astrocytes.Furthermore, adding IL-33 and serotonin could confer part of the properties ofbrain Tregs, such as ST2, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma(PPARgamma), and serotonin receptor 7 (Htr7) expression. Transcriptome analysisrevealed that in vitro generated brain Treg-like Tregs (induced brain Tregs;iB-Tregs) showed similar gene expression patterns as those in in vivo brainTregs, although they were not identical. Furthermore, in Parkinson's diseasemodels, in which T cells have been shown to be involved in disease progression,iB-Tregs infiltrated into the brain more readily and ameliorated pathologicalsymptoms more effectively than splenic Tregs. These data indicate that iB-Tregscontribute to our understanding of brain Treg development and could also betherapeutic for inflammatory brain diseases.

AB  - Anti-PD-1 immunotherapy has saved numerous lives of cancer patients; however, it only exerts efficacy in 10-15% of patients with colorectal cancer. Fecalmicrobiota transplantation (FMT) is a potential approach to improving theefficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, whereas the detailed mechanisms and theapplicability of this combination therapy remain unclear. In this study, weevaluated the synergistic effect of FMT with anti-PD-1 in curing colorectaltumor-bearing mice using a multi-omics approach. Mice treated with thecombination therapy showed superior survival rate and tumor control, compared to the mice received anti-PD-1 therapy or FMT alone. Metagenomic analysis showedthat composition of gut microbiota in tumor-bearing mice treated with anti-PD-1therapy was remarkably altered through receiving FMT. Particularly, Bacteroidesgenus, including FMT-increased B. thetaiotaomicron, B. fragilis, andFMT-decreased B. ovatus might contribute to the enhanced efficacy of anti-PD-1therapy. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis upon mouse plasma revealed severalpotential metabolites that upregulated after FMT, including punicic acid andaspirin, might promote the response to anti-PD-1 therapy via theirimmunomodulatory functions. This work broadens our understanding of the mechanismby which FMT improves the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy, which may contribute to the development of novel microbiota-based anti-cancer therapies.

AB  - Similar to other pathogens, bacteria have developed during their evolution avariety of mechanisms to overcome both innate and acquired immunity, accountingfor their ability to cause disease or chronic infections. The mechanismsexploited for this critical function act by targeting conserved structures orpathways that regulate the host immune response. A strategic potential target is the immunological synapse (IS), a highly specialized structure that forms at the interface between antigen presenting cells (APC) and T lymphocytes and isrequired for the establishment of an effective T cell response to the infectious agent and for the development of long-lasting T cell memory. While a variety ofbacterial pathogens are known to impair or subvert cellular processes essentialfor antigen processing and presentation, on which IS assembly depends, it is onlyrecently that the possibility that IS may be a direct target of bacterialvirulence factors has been considered. Emerging evidence strongly supports thisnotion, highlighting IS targeting as a powerful, novel means of immune evasion bybacterial pathogens. In this review we will present a brief overview of themechanisms used by bacteria to affect IS assembly by targeting APCs. We will thensummarize what has emerged from the current handful of studies that haveaddressed the direct impact of bacterial virulence factors on IS assembly in Tcells and, based on the strategic cellular processes targeted by these factors inother cell types, highlight potential IS-related vulnerabilities that could beexploited by these pathogens to evade T cell mediated immunity.

TI  - Drosophila Innate Immunity Involves Multiple Signaling Pathways and CoordinatedCommunication Between Different Tissues.
PG  - 905370
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.905370 [doi]
AB  - The innate immune response provides the first line of defense against invadingpathogens, and immune disorders cause a variety of diseases. The fruit flyDrosophila melanogaster employs multiple innate immune reactions to resistinfection. First, epithelial tissues function as physical barriers to preventpathogen invasion. In addition, macrophage-like plasmatocytes eliminate intrudersthrough phagocytosis, and lamellocytes encapsulate large particles, such as wasp eggs, that cannot be phagocytosed. Regarding humoral immune responses, the fatbody, equivalent to the mammalian liver, secretes antimicrobial peptides intohemolymph, killing bacteria and fungi. Drosophila has been shown to be a powerfulin vivo model for studying the mechanism of innate immunity and host-pathogeninteractions because Drosophila and higher organisms share conserved signalingpathways and factors. Moreover, the ease with which Drosophila genetic andphysiological characteristics can be manipulated prevents interference byadaptive immunity. In this review, we discuss the signaling pathways activated inDrosophila innate immunity, namely, the Toll, Imd, JNK, JAK/STAT pathways, andother factors, as well as relevant regulatory networks. We also review themechanisms by which different tissues, including hemocytes, the fat body, thelymph gland, muscles, the gut and the brain coordinate innate immune responses.Furthermore, the latest studies in this field are outlined in this review. Insummary, understanding the mechanism underlying innate immunity orchestration in Drosophila will help us better study human innate immunity-related diseases.

TI  - Lactobacillus reuteri 1 Enhances Intestinal Epithelial Barrier Function andAlleviates the Inflammatory Response Induced by Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli K88 via Suppressing the MLCK Signaling Pathway in IPEC-J2 Cells.
PG  - 897395
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.897395 [doi]
AB  - Intestinal epithelial barrier injury disrupts immune homeostasis and leads tomany intestinal disorders. Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) strains caninfluence immune system development and intestinal function. However, theunderlying mechanisms of L. reuteri LR1 that regulate inflammatory response andintestinal integrity are still unknown. The present study aimed to determine the effects of LR1 on the ETEC K88-induced intestinal epithelial injury on theinflammatory response, intestinal epithelial barrier function, and the MLCKsignal pathway and its underlying mechanism. Here, we showed that the 1 x 10(9)cfu/ml LR1 treatment for 4 h dramatically decreased interleukin-8 (IL-8) and IL-6expression. Then, the data indicated that the 1 x 10(8) cfu/ml ETEC K88 treatmentfor 4 h dramatically enhanced IL-8, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) expression. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope (SEM) dataindicated that pretreatment with LR1 inhibited the ETEC K88 that adhered onIPEC-J2 and alleviated the scratch injury of IPEC J2 cells. Moreover, LR1pretreatment significantly reversed the declined transepithelial electricalresistance (TER) and tight junction protein level, and enhanced the induction by ETEC K88 treatment. Additionally, LR1 pretreatment dramatically declined IL-8,IL-17A, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels compared with the ETEC K88 group. Then, ETECK88-treated IPEC-J2 cells had a higher level of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK),higher MLC levels, and a lower Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) level than thecontrol group, while LR1 pretreatment significantly declined the MLCK and MLCexpression and enhanced ROCK level in the ETEC K88-challenged IPEC-J2 cells.Mechanistically, depletion of MLCK significantly declined MLC expression inIPEC-J2 challenged with ETEC K88 compared to the si NC+ETEC K88 group. On theother hand, the TER of the si MLCK+ETEC K88 group was higher and the FD4 flux in the si MLCK+ETEC K88 group was lower compared with the si NC+ETEC K88 group. Inaddition, depletion of MLCK significantly enhanced Claudin-1 level and declinedIL-8 and TNF-alpha levels in IPEC-J2 pretreated with LR1 followed by challenging with ETEC K88. In conclusion, our work indicated that L. reuteri LR1 can decline inflammatory response and improve intestinal epithelial barrier function through suppressing the MLCK signal pathway in the ETEC K88-challenged IPEC-J2.

AB  - Deficiency of adenosine deaminase 2 (DADA2) is an inherited autosomal recessivedisease characterized by autoinflammation (recurrent fever), vasculopathy (livedoracemosa, polyarteritis nodosa, lacunar ischemic strokes, and intracranialhemorrhages, end organ vasculitis), immunodeficiency, lymphoproliferation, immunecytopenias, and bone marrow failure. Allogeneic hematopoietic celltransplantation (HCT) is curative for DADA2 as it reverses the hematological,immune and vascular phenotype of DADA2. The primary goal of HCT in DADA2, like inother non-malignant diseases, is engraftment with the establishment of normalhematopoiesis and normal immune function. Strategies in selecting a preparativeregimen should take into consideration the specific vulnerabilities toendothelial dysfunction and liver toxicity in DADA2 patients. Overcoming anincreased risk of graft rejection while minimizing organ toxicity,graft-versus-host disease, and infections can be particularly challenging inDADA2 patients. This review will discuss approaches to HCT in DADA2 patientsincluding disease-specific considerations, barriers to successful engraftment,post-HCT complications, and clinical outcomes of published patients with DADA2who have undergone HCT to date.

PG  - 941530
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.941530 [doi]
AB  - The gut microbiota has been identified as a predictive biomarker for variousdiseases. However, few studies focused on the diagnostic accuracy of gutmicrobiota derived-signature for predicting hepatic injuries in schistosomiasis. Here, we characterized the gut microbiomes from 94 human and mouse stool samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The diversity and composition of gut microbiomes in Schistosoma japonicum infection-induced disease changed significantly. Gutmicrobes, such as Bacteroides, Blautia, Enterococcus, Alloprevotella,Parabacteroides and Mucispirillum, showed a significant correlation with thelevel of hepatic granuloma, fibrosis, hydroxyproline, ALT or AST in S. japonicum infection-induced disease. We identified a range of gut bacterial features todistinguish schistosomiasis from hepatic injuries using the random forestclassifier model, LEfSe and STAMP analysis. Significant features Bacteroides,Blautia, and Enterococcus and their combinations have a robust predictiveaccuracy (AUC: from 0.8182 to 0.9639) for detecting liver injuries induced by S. japonicum infection in humans and mice. Our study revealed associations betweengut microbiota features and physiopathology and serological shifts ofschistosomiasis and provided preliminary evidence for novel gutmicrobiota-derived features for the non-invasive detection of schistosomiasis.

AB  - Our understanding of the immune responses that follow SARS-CoV-2 infection andvaccination has progressed considerably since the COVID-19 pandemic was firstdeclared on the 11(th) of March in 2020. Recovery from infection is associatedwith the development of protective immune responses, although over time thesebecome less effective against new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Consequently,reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 variants is not infrequent and has contributed to theongoing pandemic. COVID-19 vaccines have had a tremendous impact on reducinginfection and particularly the number of deaths associated with SARS-CoV-2infection. However, waning of vaccine induced immunity plus the emergence of new variants has necessitated the use of boosters to maintain the benefits ofvaccination in reducing COVID-19 associated deaths. Boosting is also beneficialfor individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and developed natural immunity, also enhancing responses immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants. This reviewsummarizes our understanding of the immune responses that follow SARS-CoV-2infection and vaccination, the risks of reinfection with emerging variants andthe very important protective role vaccine boosting plays in both vaccinated and previously infected individuals.

AB  - Commensal bacteria and other microorganisms that reside in the human body areclosely associated with the development and treatment of cancers. Recently, tumormicrobiome (TM) has been identified in a variety of cancers such as pancreatic,lung, and breast cancers. TM has different compositions in different tumors andhas different effects on tumors. TM plays an important role in the formation ofthe tumor microenvironment, regulation of local immunity, and modification oftumor cell biology, and directly affects the efficacy of drug treatment fortumors. TM is expected to be a biomarker for tumors, and engineeredtumor-targeting bacteria and anti-cancer microbial agents (GEN-001) have animportant role in the treatment of tumors. This paper reviews the relevantstudies on TM in recent years and describes its distribution in different tumors,its correlation with clinical features, its effect on local immunity, and theresearch directions of TM in tumor treatment.

PG  - 882706
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.882706 [doi]
AB  - Hemichannels (HCs)/gap junctions (GJs) and immunoglobulin (Ig)-likedomain-containing proteins (IGLDCPs) are involved in the innate-adaptive immuneresponse independently. Despite of available evidence demonstrating theimportance of HCs/GJs and IGLDCPs in initiating, implementing, and terminatingthe entire immune response, our understanding of their mutual interactions inimmunological function remains rudimentary. IGLDCPs include immune checkpointmolecules of the immunoglobulin family expressed in T and B lymphocytes, most of which are cluster of differentiation (CD) antigens. They also constitute theprincipal components of the immunological synapse (IS), which is formed on thecell surface, including the phagocytic synapse, T cell synapse, B cell synapse,and astrocytes-neuronal synapse. During the three stages of the immune response, namely innate immunity, innate-adaptive immunity, and adaptive immunity, HCs/GJs and IGLDCPs are cross-activated during the entire process. The present reviewsummarizes the current understanding of HC-released immune signaling factors thatinfluence IGLDCPs in regulating innate-adaptive immunity. ATP-induced "eat me"signals released by HCs, as well as CD31, CD47, and CD46 "don't eat me" signalingmolecules, trigger initiation of innate immunity, which serves to regulatephagocytosis. Additionally, HC-mediated trogocytosis promotes antigenpresentation and amplification. Importantly, HC-mediated CD4(+) T lymphocyteactivation is critical in the transition of the innate immune response toadaptive immunity. HCs also mediate non-specific transcytosis of antibodiesproduced by mature B lymphocytes, for instance, IgA transcytosis in ovariancancer cells, which triggers innate immunity. Further understanding of theinterplay between HCs/GJs and IGLDCPs would aid in identifying therapeutictargets that regulate the HC-Ig-like domain immune response, thereby providing a viable treatment strategy for immunological diseases. The present reviewdelineates the clinical immunology-related applications of HC-Ig-like domaincross-activation, which would greatly benefit medical professionals andimmunological researchers alike. HCs/GJs and IGLDCPs mediate phagocytosis viaATP; "eat me and don't eat me" signals trigger innate immunity; HC-mediatedtrogocytosis promotes antigen presentation and amplification in innate-adaptiveimmunity; HCs also mediate non-specific transcytosis of antibodies produced bymature B lymphocytes in adaptive immunity.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is still a major burden for global health despite effective vaccines. With the reduction of social distancing measures, infection rates are increasing in children, while data on the pediatric immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is still lacking. Although the typical disease course in children has been mild, emerging variants may present new challenges in this age group. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 51 convalescent children, 24 seronegative siblings from early 2020, and 51 unexposed controls were stimulated withSARS-CoV-2-derived peptide MegaPools from the ancestral and beta variants. Flowcytometric determination of activation-induced markers and secreted cytokineswere used to quantify the CD4+ T cell response. The average time after infection was over 80 days. CD4+ T cell responses were detected in 61% of convalescentchildren and were markedly reduced in preschool children. Cross-reactive T cells for the SARS-CoV-2 beta variant were identified in 45% of cases after infectionwith an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 variant. The CD4+ T cell response was accompaniedmost predominantly by IFN-gamma and Granzyme B secretion. An antiviral CD4+ Tcell response was present in children after ancestral SARS-CoV-2 infection, whichwas reduced in the youngest age group. We detected significant cross-reactivityof CD4+ T cell responses to the more recently evolved immune-escaping betavariant. Our findings have epidemiologic relevance for children regarding novelviral variants of concern and vaccination efforts.

AB  - MicroRNA-7 (miR-7) is a highly conserved short non-coding RNA involved in variousbioprocesses via the regulation of multiple target genes. To enrich our knowledgeof the functions of miR-7 in innate immune regulation in echinoderms, we firstinvestigated the targeting relationship between miR-7 and PAK1 in the seacucumber Apostichopus japonicus and then explored the functions of miR-7, thePAK1 gene, and the miR-7/PAK1 axis in the pathogen-induced immune response of A. japonicus. Our results showed that miR-7 can bind to the 3'UTR of PAK1 andnegatively regulate the expression of PAK1 in A. japonicus. Overexpression andinhibition of miR-7 and inhibition of the expression of PAK1 can alterphagocytosis, cellular agglutination, and lysozyme contents in A. japonicus. BothmiR-7 and the PAK1 gene are involved in immune defense against Vibrio splendidus infection; the miR-7/AjPAK1 axis showed immune regulatory function at 48 to 72 h post-infection (hpi) after V. splendidus infection in A. japonicus. In summary,the results of this study established that miR-7 regulates the pathogen-inducedimmune response by targeting PAK1 in A. japonicus.

AB  - Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) significantly improves clinical outcomes and reduces mortality of infants/children living with HIV. However, the ability of infected cells to establish latent viral reservoirs shortly afterinfection and to persist during long-term ART remains a major barrier to cure. Inaddition, while early ART treatment of infants living with HIV can limit the sizeof the virus reservoir, it can also blunt HIV-specific immune responses and does not mediate clearance of latently infected viral reservoirs. Thus, adjunctiveimmune-based therapies that are geared towards limiting the establishment of the virus reservoir and/or mediating the clearance of persistent reservoirs are ofinterest for their potential to achieve viral remission in the setting ofpediatric HIV. Because of the differences between the early life and adult immunesystems, these interventions may need to be tailored to the pediatric settings.Understanding the attributes and specificities of the early life immune milieuthat are likely to impact the virus reservoir is important to guide thedevelopment of pediatric-specific immune-based interventions towards viralremission and cure. In this review, we compare the immune profiles of pediatricand adult HIV elite controllers, discuss the characteristics of cellular andanatomic HIV reservoirs in pediatric populations, and highlight the potentialvalues of current cure strategies using immune-based therapies for long-termviral remission in the absence of ART in children living with HIV.

AB  - Human gastric autoimmunity [autoimmune gastritis (AIG)] is characterized byinflammation of the gastric mucosa and parietal cell loss. The gastric parietalcell proton pump H(+)/K(+)-adenosine triphosphatase (H(+)/K(+)-ATPase) is themajor autoantigen in AIG. Our work aimed to investigate the gastricH(+)/K(+)-ATPase-specific T helper 17 (Th17) responses in AIG and seruminterleukin (IL)-17 cytokine subfamily in AIG patients, in healthy subjects[healthy controls (HCs)], and in patients with iron deficiency anemia (IDA)without AIG. We analyzed the activation of gastric lamina propria mononuclearcells (LPMCs) by H(+)/K(+)-ATPase and the IL-17A and IL-17F cytokine productionin eight patients with AIG and four HCs. Furthermore, we compared serum levels ofIL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, IL-17E, IL-22, and IL-23 in 43 AIG patients, in 47 HCs,and in 20 IDA patients without AIG. Gastric LPMCs from all AIG patients, but not those from HCs, were activated by H(+)/K(+)-ATPase and were able to proliferateand produce high levels of IL-17A and IL-17F. AIG patients have significantlyhigher serum IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-17E (393.3 +/- 410.02 pg/ml, 394.0 +/-378.03 pg/ml, 300.46 +/- 303.45 pg/ml, 34.92 +/- 32.56 pg/ml, respectively) than those in HCs (222.99 +/- 361.24 pg/ml, 217.49 +/- 312.1 pg/ml, 147.43 +/- 259.17 pg/ml, 8.69 +/- 8.98 pg/ml, respectively) and those in IDA patients without AIG(58.06 +/- 107.49 pg/ml, 74.26 +/- 178.50 pg/ml, 96.86 +/- 177.46 pg/ml, 10.64+/- 17.70 pg/ml, respectively). Altogether, our results indicate that IL-17A and IL-17F are produced in vivo in the stomach of AIG patients following activationwith H(+)/K(+)-ATPase and that serum IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-17E levels aresignificantly elevated in AIG patients but not in patients without AIG. Thesedata suggest a Th17 signature in AIG and that IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-17Emay represent a relevant tool for AIG management.

AB  - Background: Placental malaria (PM) is associated with a higher susceptibility of infants to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria. A hypothesis of immune tolerancehas been suggested but no clear explanation has been provided so far. Our goalwas to investigate the involvement of inhibitory receptors LILRB1 and LILRB2,known to drive immune evasion upon ligation with pathogen and/or host ligands, inPM-induced immune tolerance. Method: Infants of women with or without PM wereenrolled in Allada, southern Benin, and followed-up for 24 months. Antibodieswith specificity for five blood stage parasite antigens were quantified by ELISA,and the frequency of immune cell subsets was quantified by flow cytometry. LILRB1or LILRB2 expression was assessed on cells collected at 18 and 24 months of age. Findings: Infants born to women with PM had a higher risk of developingsymptomatic malaria than those born to women without PM (IRR=1.53, p=0.040), and such infants displayed a lower frequency of non-classical monocytes (OR=0.74,p=0.01) that overexpressed LILRB2 (OR=1.36, p=0.002). Moreover, infants born towomen with PM had lower levels of cytophilic IgG and higher levels of IL-10during active infection. Interpretation: Modulation of IgG and IL-10 levels couldimpair monocyte functions (opsonisation/phagocytosis) in infants born to womenwith PM, possibly contributing to their higher susceptibility to malaria. Thelong-lasting effect of PM on infants' monocytes was notable, raising questionsabout the capacity of ligands such as Rifins or HLA-I molecules to bind to LILRB1and LILRB2 and to modulate immune responses, and about the reprogramming ofneonatal monocytes/macrophages.

AB  - The association of Jumonji domain-containing 6 (JMJD6) with the prognosis ofvarious types of cancer has been demonstrated, except in intrahepaticcholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The present study aimed to clarify the impact of JMJD6 on ICC. The liver specimens of 51 patients who underwent surgery for ICC wereanalyzed for JMJD6 expression using immunohistochemistry staining. Therelationship between clinicopathological factors and JMJD6 expression wasinvestigated. The cellular activity was also evaluated in JMJD6 knocked downcells with Transwell migration assay and viability assay. In theimmunohistochemistry staining of clinical samples, high expression of JMJD6 wasseen in 32 of 51 samples. High expression was also associated with improvedoverall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P=0.0033 and 0.048,respectively). Further analyses revealed that higher JMJD6 expression was one of the improved independent prognostic factors of OS and RFS. Expression of JMJD6was knocked down in commercial culture cell lines of ICC, and RNA and proteinwere extracted to analyze the downstream gene expression using RNA-sequencing andwestern blotting. JMJD6 knockdown was associated with higher programmeddeath-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in RNA-sequencing and western blotting. Inaddition, PD-L1 expression was higher in JMJD6 low expression clinical sampleswhen measured using immunohistochemistry staining. In conclusion, high expressionof JMJD6 was an independent favorable prognostic factor of ICC. JMJD6 mayinfluence the prognosis of ICC through the regulation of PD-L1 expression.

AB  - A 45-year-old Japanese man underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealedspotty redness at the gastric fornix, mucosal swelling, diffuse redness in thecorpus, and mucosal atrophy in the gastric angle and antrum. Histologicalexamination showed rod-shaped bacteria that appeared larger than Helicobacterpylori. The patient tested positive for rapid urease test, and serum anti-H.pylori IgG antibody test results were negative. Further examination of thebacteria revealed that H. suis antibody test was positive, and the presence of H.suis was confirmed using H. suis-specific real-time PCR. H. suis was successfullyeradicated after triple therapy with vonoprazan, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin.This case reinforces the notion that non-H. pylori Helicobacter species such asH. suis and H. heilmannii may be involved in the pathogenesis of active gastritisin patients who test negative for H. pylori antibodies.

PG  - 586-596
LID - 10.22038/IJBMS.2022.64787.14266 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Human T leukemia virus type one (HTLV-1) causes two life-threatening diseases in around five percent of infected subjects, a T cell malignancy and aneurodegenerative disease. TAX and HBZ are the main virulence agents implicatedin the manifestation of HTLV-1-associated diseases. Therefore, this study aims toproduce these HTLV-1 factors as recombinant Fc fusion proteins to study thestructures, their immunogenic properties as vaccines, and their capability toproduce specific neutralization antibodies. Materials and Methods: TAX and HBZsequences were chosen from the NCBI-nucleotide database, then designed as humanFc chimers and cloned into Pichia pastoris. Produced proteins were purified byHiTrap affinity chromatography and subcutaneously injected into rabbits. RabbitAbs were purified by batch chromatography, and their neutralization activitiesfor the HTLV-1-infected MT-2 cell line were assessed. Furthermore, the protectiveabilities of recombinant proteins were evaluated in Tax or HBZ immunized rabbits by MT-2 cell line inoculation and measurement of HTLV-1-proviral load. Results:Specific Abs against Tax and HBZ can eliminate 2 million MT-2 cells in 1/1000dilution in vitro. In challenging assays, the immunization of the animals usingTax or HBZ had no protective activity as HTLV-1 PVL was still positive.Conclusion: The result suggests that recombinant TAX and HBZ: hFcgamma1 proteins can produce a proper humoral immune response. Therefore, they could be considereda passive immunotherapy source for HTLV-1-associated diseases, while total TAXand HBZ proteins are unsuitable as HTLV-1 vaccine candidates.

TI  - A case report of Enterobacter cloacae endocarditis in a patient with a history ofcotton fever.
PG  - ytac258
LID - 10.1093/ehjcr/ytac258 [doi]
AB  - Background: Cotton fever is a self-limited, febrile syndrome occurring after the injection of trace amounts of drugs, in particular heroin, extracted from reused cotton filters. It is characterized by non-specific findings, such as fever,tachycardia, and leucocytosis. The leading pathophysiologic explanation suggests it is the result of direct inoculation of the bloodstream with endotoxins fromGram-negative bacilli of the genus Enterobacter, known to colonize all parts ofthe cotton plant. Only one prior case report has suggested cotton fever as apotential risk factor of infective endocarditis (IE). Case summary: We describe acase of a 57-year-old patient with a history of intravenous heroin usecomplicated by self-reported episodes of cotton fever. His presentation wasnotable for Enterobacter cloacae IE with bilateral septic pulmonary emboli.Transthoracic echocardiography findings included new tricuspid regurgitation and two mobile echodensities on the right atrial implantable cardioverterdefibrillator (ICD) lead. Despite broad antibiotic coverage and extraction of theICD leads, the patient passed away from septic shock. Discussion: The presentcase report is only the second published report of endocarditis in a patient witha history of cotton fever. In both cases, bacteria of the Enterobacter genus wereisolated in patients' blood cultures. This evidence supports the endotoxin theoryas the leading pathophysiologic explanation for cotton fever and suggests cotton fever as a risk factor for Gram-negative IE. In the inpatient setting it informs proper antibiotic coverage, whereas in the outpatient setting it supports harmreduction interventions in the form of sterile cotton balls.

AB  - Crematogaster matsumurai (Forel 1901) is an important arboreal ant speciescommonly found on Phyllostachys heterocycla (Carr.) in Lishui, Zhejiang, China.This study analyzed the mitochondrial genome sequence of C. matsumurai anddiscussed its phylogenetic relationship in Hymenoptera. The circularmitochondrial genome was 16,028 bp long, including a standard set of 22 transfer RNAs (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs),which showed the typical insect mitochondrial genome arrangement. The AT and GCcontents of the mitochondrial genome sequence were 76.92% and 23.08%,respectively. The maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis based on wholemitochondrial genome sequences showed that C. matsumurai is closest toCrematogaster teranishii.

TI  - Chemical Synthesis and Immunological Evaluation of Fragments of theMultiantennary Group-Specific Polysaccharide of Group B Streptococcus.
PG  - 1724-1735
LID - 10.1021/jacsau.2c00302 [doi]
AB  - Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a Gram-positive bacterium and the most commoncause of neonatal blood and brain infections. At least 10 different serotypesexist, that are characterized by their different capsular polysaccharides. TheGroup B carbohydrate (GBC) is shared by all serotypes and therefore attractive beused in a glycoconjugate vaccine. The GBC is a highly complex multiantennarystructure, composed of rhamnose rich oligosaccharides interspaced with glucitolphosphates. We here report the development of a convergent approach to assemble apentamer, octamer, and tridecamer fragment of the termini of the antennae.Phosphoramidite chemistry was used to fuse the pentamer and octamer fragments to deliver the 13-mer GBC oligosaccharide. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopyof the generated fragments confirmed the structures of the naturally occurringpolysaccharide. The fragments were used to generate model glycoconjugate vaccine by coupling with CRM197. Immunization of mice delivered sera that was shown to becapable of recognizing different GBS strains. The antibodies raised using the13-mer conjugate were shown to recognize the bacteria best and the serum raisedagainst this GBC fragment-mediated opsonophagocytic killing best, but in acapsule dependent manner. Overall, the GBC 13-mer was identified to be a highlypromising antigen for incorporation into future (multicomponent) anti-GBSvaccines.

AB  - Hepatic abscesses are a seldom finding although they are the most common type of intraabdominal abscess. We find that this localized collection of pus can be aresult of bacteria, ameba, or fungi. This study will mainly focus on the firsttype, the pyogenic liver abscess (PLA), in which management is predicated on sizeof abscess. There is no standard definition as to what constitutes a small orlarge hepatic abscess. Here, we present a case of a 10 cm PLA found in the right lobe of the liver. We aimed to discuss the relevant epidemiology,pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and management of PLAs.

PG  - 3715806
LID - 10.1155/2022/3715806 [doi]
AB  - Carrageenan, a sulfated polysaccharide, was produced by certain species of marinered seaweeds, which have been used as a significant source of food, feed, andantibiotic agent throughout history due to their alleged human health benefits.The present study aimed to derive the polysaccharides from Hypnea valentiae anddescribe the biological applications. Carrageenan was characterized by FT-IR,C-NMR, AFM, and their antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticoagulant capabilities;furthermore, the larvicidal effect of methanol extract was generated from theseaweed against Aedes aegypti larvae at various concentrations. The moleculardocking experiments were carried out computationally for finding the molecularinsight of the macromolecules and small molecules' interaction using GLIDEdocking by using Schrodinger software. Antibacterial zones of inhibition indifferent concentrations are compared with the 40 mg/mL higher activity againstbacterial pathogens. Carrageenan is strong in all antioxidant activities, withthe overall antioxidant (70.1 +/- 0.61%) of radical at 250 mug/mL concentrationbeing exhibited. The DPPH scavenging is effective in the inhibition of (65.74 +/-0.58%) radical at a concentration of 160 mug/mL and the hydroxyl scavenging(65.72 +/- 0.60%) of activity at a concentration of 125 mug/mL being exhibited.Anticoagulant activities (APPT and PT) of carrageenan fraction were tested. H.valentiae and heparin sulphate shows higher activity of APTT (106.50 IU at 25mug/mL) in comparison with the PT test (57.86 IU at 25 mug/mL) and the methanolextraction of higher larvicidal activity on A. aegypti (LC50 = 99.675 mug/mL). Inthis study, the carrageenan was exploited through in vitro and in silicomolecular docking studies against antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anticoagulantproperties. The results were establishing the potentiality of the carrageenanwhich is an alternative source to control the mosquitocidal property in thefuture. Moreover, molecular docking of carrageenan against multiple targetsresults in -7 to -6 Kcal/mol binding score. Findings of carrageen from in vitroto in silico studies are needed for further validation of clinical pieces ofevidence.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of endoscopic tympanic membranecatheterization and ofloxacin ear drops in the treatment of secretory otitismedia in infants and toddlers. Methods: A total of 80 children suffering fromsecretory otitis media who underwent treatment in our hospital from July 2018 to April 2020 were divided into the control group (n = 40) and experimental group (n= 40) by randomization. The control group was treated with endoscopic tympanicmembrane catheterization alone, while the experimental group was treated withofloxacin ear drops based on the same treatment as the control group. Thetreatment effect, air conduction hearing level, clearance rate of pathogenicbacteria secreted by the ear canal, recurrence rate, and adverse reactions werecompared between the two groups. Results: The treatment in the experimental groupled to a significantly better outcome than that in the control group (P < 0.05). After treatment, a substantially improved air conduction hearing level in theexperimental group was observed (P < 0.001). A chi-square test showed asignificantly higher clearance rate of pathogenic bacteria secreted from the ear canal of the children in the experimental group compared to that of the controlgroup (P < 0.05). The treatment in the experimental group resulted in a lowerrecurrence rate and adverse reaction rate as compared to the control group (P <0.05). Conclusion: Concurrent endoscopic tympanic membrane catheterization andofloxacin ear drops showed excellent efficacy in the treatment of secretoryotitis media in infants and toddlers. The therapy offers promising solutions for the improvement of hearing level, increase of clearance rate of pathogenicbacteria secreted from the ear canal, and decrease of disease recurrence andadverse reactions during treatment.

PG  - 907386
LID - 10.3389/fnut.2022.907386 [doi]
AB  - Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) play important roles in promoting animal health,however, their impact on intestinal health remains elusive. This study wasintended to evaluate the effects of different doses of SeNPs on the intestinalhealth, especially the development of goblet cells in the broiler jejunum. Atotal of 480 1-day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly allotted to 5treatments with 6 replications of 16 chicks each. Birds were fed with lowselenium corn-soybean meal-based diets supplemented with 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, or 0.4mg/kg of SeNPs. On d 21, dietary supplementation of SeNPs effectively reduced themortality of broilers. The villus height and the villus height/crypt depth ratio of the jejunum showed significant quadratic effects with the increasingconcentration of SeNPs (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression of zonula occluden-1(ZO-1), ZO-2, claudin-3, and claudin-5 in the jejunum decreased linearly with theincreasing dose of SeNPs (P < 0.05). The mRNA expression levels of interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta), IL-18, and the concentration of reactive oxygen species (ROS) inthe jejunum decreased linearly with the increase of SeNPs concentration (P <0.05). Compared with the control group, the number of goblet cells in the jejunumwas significantly increased by adding 0.1 and 0.4 mg/kg SeNPs(P < 0.05). Inaddition, the mRNA expression of Mucin2 (Muc2) showed a significant quadraticrelationship that increased after adding 0.1 mg/kg SeNPs (P < 0.05). DietarySeNPs also linearly reduced the expression of v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-myc) (P < 0.05). The mean density of TUNEL positive cells in the 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg SeNPs groups were lower than the control group (P < 0.05). Similarly, the mRNA expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2),Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), cysteinylaspartate specific proteinase-1 (Caspase-1), toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2), andmyeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in the jejunum decreased linearly with the increase of SeNPs concentration (P < 0.05). Results show that supplementationwith 0.2 mg/kg SeNPs may decrease intestinal oxidative stress and inflammation bymodifying the activation of NLRP3 signaling pathway, which can effectivelypromote intestinal goblet cells of 21-day-old broilers.

AB  - Changes in dietary composition affect the rumen microbiota in ruminants. However,information on the effects of dietary concentrate-to-forage ratio changes on yak rumen bacteria and metabolites is limited. This study characterized the effect ofthree different dietary concentrate-to-forage ratios (50:50, C50 group; 65:35,C65 group; 80:20, C80 group) on yak rumen fluid microbiota and metabolites using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)analyses. Rumen fermentation parameters and the abundance of rumen bacteria were affected by changes in the dietary concentrate-to-forage ratio, and there was astrong correlation between them. At the genus level, higher relative abundancesof norank_f__F082, NK4A214_group, Lachnospiraceae_NK3A20_group, Acetitomaculum,and norank_f__norank_o__Clostridia_UCG-014 were observed with a high dietaryconcentrate-to-forage ratio (P < 0.05). Combined metabolomic and enrichmentanalyses showed that changes in the dietary concentrate-to-forage ratiosignificantly affected rumen metabolites related to amino acid metabolism,protein digestion and absorption, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, and purine metabolism. Compared with the C50 group, 3-methylindole, pantothenic acid,D-pantothenic acid, and 20-hydroxy-leukotriene E4 were downregulated in the C65group, while spermine and ribose 1-phosphate were upregulated. Compared to theC50 group, Xanthurenic acid, tyramine, ascorbic acid, D-glucuronic acid,6-keto-prostaglandin F1a, lipoxin B4, and deoxyadenosine monophosphate wereupregulated in the C80 group, while 3-methylindole and 20-hydroxy-leukotriene E4 were downregulated. All metabolites (Xanthurenic acid, L-Valine,N-Acetyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde, N-Acetyl-L-glutamic acid, Tyramine,6-Keto-prostaglandin F1a, Lipoxin B4, Xanthosine, Thymine, Deoxyinosine, and Uricacid) were upregulated in the C80 group compared with the C65 group. Correlation analysis of microorganisms and metabolites provided new insights into thefunction of rumen bacteria, as well as a theoretical basis for formulating morescientifically appropriate feeding strategies for yak.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the impact of four unifloral honeys on thefood-borne pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, byanalyzing the honeys' antibacterial and biofilm degradation effects, as well astheir antioxidant activity and element content. Linden and milkweed honeysrepresented light colored honeys, while goldenrod and chestnut honeys the darker ones. The botanical origin of the honeys and the relative frequency of theirpollen types were established with melissopalynological analysis. The antioxidantcapacities were calculated by two single electron transfer based methods (TRC -Total Reducing Capacity and TEAC - Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity) and a hydrogen atom transfer based assay (ORAC - Oxygen Radical Absorbance). The amountof four main macro- and two microelements was quantified. The antibacterialactivity was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and membranedegradation assays. Furthermore, the biofilm degradation power of the samples wasstudied as well. The light colored linden honey with the lowest TRC and TEAC, butwith the highest ORAC antioxidant activity and high element content showed thebest antibacterial and biofilm degradation effects. Meanwhile, the dark coloredchestnut honey with significantly higher single electron transfer basedantioxidant capacities, with high element content, but lower ORAC showedsignificantly higher MIC and lower membrane degradation activity than lindenhoney. In case of biofilm degradation, both honey types gave similarly highinhibitory effect. Goldenrod honey was similarly effective regarding its MICproperties like chestnut honey, but had significantly lower antioxidant potentialand ability to disrupt bacterial membranes and biofilms. Milkweed honey was thehoney type with the lowest bioactivity and element content. The honeys,unequivocally characterized by their antioxidant characters and element content, displayed different antibacterial and biofilm degradation effects. In addition,some honey traits were found to be good predictors of the antimicrobial potentialof honeys: ORAC assay showed correlation with the MIC values of both bacteria,and strict correlation was found between the mineral content and the antibiofilm activity of the studied honeys. Our studies indicate that unifloral honeys, such as linden and chestnut honeys, are plant-derived products with great potential asantimicrobial agents in food preservation, exhibiting remarkable antibacterialactivity against food-borne pathogens.

AB  - Nowadays, effective cancer therapy is a global concern, and recent advances innanomedicine are crucial. Cancer is one of the major fatal diseases and a leadingcause of death globally. Nanotechnology provides rapidly evolving deliverysystems in science for treating diseases in a site-specific manner using natural bioactive compounds, which are gaining widespread attention. Nanotechnologycombined with bioactives is a very appealing and relatively new area in cancertreatment. Natural bioactive compounds have the potential to be employed as achemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of cancer, in addition to theirnutritional benefits. Alginate, pullulan, cellulose, polylactic acid, chitosan,and other biopolymers have been effectively used in the delivery of therapeutics to a specific site. Because of their biodegradability, biopolymeric nanoparticles(BNPs) have received a lot of attention in the development of new anticancer drugdelivery systems. Biopolymer-based nanoparticle systems can be made in a variety of ways. These systems have developed as a cost-effective and environmentallyfriendly solution to boost treatment efficacy. Effective drug delivery systemswith improved availability, increased selectivity, and lower toxicity are needed.Recent research findings and current knowledge on the use of BNPs in theadministration of bioactive chemicals in cancer therapy are summarized in thisreview.

AB  - Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection remains a public health concern worldwide. The diagnosis and treatment of disseminated M. tuberculosis is verydifficult, so we shared our experiences and lessons learned in this case report. Case Presentation: A 36-year-old female with a history of epilepsy presented toour hospital with fever, upper abdominal pain, muscle soreness in limbs for 7days, and shortness of breath for 4 days. On admission, she presented with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and liver dysfunction. Due to the criticalnature of her clinical presentation, the patient was admitted directly to theIntensive Care Unit (ICU), received mechanical ventilation in prone position and VV-ECMO treatment. Her condition improved gradually, and the ECMO was removedafter 7 days and she was weaned off the ventilator after 8 days. However, herfever recurred and she underwent PET-CT examination, liver contrast ultrasound,acid-fast staining and second-generation sequencing of cerebrospinal fluid, whichconfirmed M. tuberculosis infection. Conclusion: This case report brieflydescribed the treatment and diagnosis of a critically ill patient with intra and extra-pulmonary tuberculosis infection. Timely and appropriate treatment iscrucial to save lives, but the timing of ECMO treatment needs to be carefullyconsidered for patients with ARDS caused by tuberculosis.

AB  - Nocardia endophthalmitis is a relatively uncommon form of endophthalmitis seen inclinical patients. In general, Nocardia endophthalmitis tends to carry a poorprognosis. Here, we report a 3-year-old child who was admitted to the hospitaldue to a rupture of the left eye. The suturing and anterior chamber formationwere performed immediately. Approximately, 16 days after the operation, massivewhitish plump and tufted exudates gathered in the pupil area and at the bottom ofthe anterior chamber, and the child was diagnosed with endophthalmitis. Theinfection was initially considered to be caused by fungal pathogens for that the hyphae and spores were observed in the smear. However, the isolate obtained after4 days of culturation was identified as actinomycetes using MALDI-TOF. We furtherclassified it as Nocardia huaxiensis by next-generation sequencing (NGS) based onthe MinION platform. Amikacin and sulfamethoxazole tablets were used to controlthe infection and the ocular inflammation subsided gradually. Intraocular lens(IOL) implantation is planned to be performed at an appropriate future time toimprove his vision. Nocardia endophthalmitis is rare and usually caused by oculartrauma or surgery. In conclusion, Nocardia huaxiensis should be considered as an emerging pathogen and deserves more attention.

AB  - A high incidence of dementia (60-80%) and a high rate of memory loss are two ofthe most common symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which affects the elderly. Researchers have recommended that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Indianmedicines can be used to prevent and cure AD. Several studies have linkedneuroinflammation linked to amyloid-beta (Abeta) deposition in the brain to thepathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders. As a result, more research isneeded to determine the role of inflammation in neurodegeneration. Increasedmicroglial activation, cytokine production, reactive oxygen species (ROS), andnuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) all play a role in the inflammatory process ofAD. This review focuses on the role of neuroinflammation in neuroprotection andthe molecular processes used by diverse natural substances, phytochemicals, andherbal formulations in distinct signaling pathways. Currently, researchers arefocusing on pharmacologically active natural compounds with theanti-neuroinflammatory potential, making them a possible contender for treatingAD. Furthermore, the researchers investigated the limits of past studies on TCM, Indian Ayurveda, and AD. Numerous studies have been carried out to examine theeffects of medicinal whole-plant extracts on AD. Clinical investigations haveshown that lignans, flavonoids, tannins, polyphenols, triterpenoids, sterols, andalkaloids have anti-inflammatory, antiamyloidogenic, anticholinesterase, andantioxidant properties. This review summarizes information about numerousmedicinal plants and isolated compounds used in the treatment of AD and a list offurther references.

PG  - 75-80
LID - 10.4103/jgid.jgid_276_21 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Infections associated with catheter in the upper urinary tract(CUUT), which include the double-J stent and the percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN)tube, get particularly infected in patients with specific risk factors fordeveloping an infection. Methods: A retrospective observational study was carriedout by compiling data from the hospital information system of a tertiary carecenter from 2019 to 2021 to evaluate infections in patients with catheter in the upper urinary tract. Result: A total of 200 pus samples of double-J stent (96 pussamples) and PCN tube (104 pus samples) were included in our study. Amongpatients with nephrostomy tube, the most frequently isolated microorganisms were Escherichia coli, followed by Pseudomonas spp. In those with a double-J stent,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by E. coli were the most commonly isolatedmicroorganisms. We found 55.72% of cases of Enterobacteriaceae-producingcarbapenemases in patients with a percutaneous catheter. 66.07% ofEnterobacteriaceae in patients with double-J and nephrostomy stents areextended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The percentage of cultureswith multiple-drug resistance (MDR) microorganisms was 38.54% in patients withdouble-J stents and 37.75% in nephrostomy tubes. The presence of prior urinarytract infection (P = 0.010), presence of urinary catheter before admission (P =0.005), increased time with single urinary catheter in-situ (P < 0.001), andincreased length of hospital stay (P = 0.036) were risk factors for isolation of MDR microorganisms. Conclusion: Pseudomonas spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa arecommonly infecting both the CUUT. E. coli infections are more commonly infecting the nephrostomy tubes. MDR microorganisms are frequent, mainly in patients withprior urinary tract infection, presence of urinary catheter before admission, andprolonged use of a single catheter.

PG  - 64-68
LID - 10.4103/jgid.jgid_110_21 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Hyponatremia is a frequent finding in hospitalized patients and is associated with poor clinical outcomes. While hyponatremia is known to commonlyoccur in certain infections, its association with melioidosis has not beenstudied previously. We studied incidence and impact of hyponatremia on clinicaloutcomes in melioidosis. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of asingle-center hospital registry of culture-positive patients with melioidosishospitalized during a 10-year period (January 01, 2010, through January 31,2021). Hyponatremia was defined as serum sodium of <135 mmol/L, and severehyponatremia as serum sodium <120 mmol/L. The association of hyponatremia within-hospital mortality, need for intensive care unit (ICU) stay and mechanicalventilation was studied. Results: Of 201 patients with melioidosis, 169 (84.1%)had hyponatremia, with severe hyponatremia in 35 (17.4%) patients. Older age(adjusted odds ratios [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.00-1.06; P =0.049) and acute kidney injury (AKI) (adjusted OR 3.30, 95% CI: 1.19-9.19; P =0.02) were independently associated with hyponatremia. Twenty-two patients hadbeen evaluated for cause of hyponatremia and of these, 11 (50%) had syndrome ofinappropriate antidiuresis. Severe hyponatremia was associated with in-hospitalmortality (adjusted OR 3.75, 95% CI: 1.37-10.27; P = 0.01), need for ICU stay(adjusted OR 7.04, 95% CI: 2.88-17.19; P < 0.001) and mechanical ventilation(adjusted OR 3.99, 95% CI: 1.54-10.32; P = 0.004). Conclusion: Hyponatremiaoccurs in 84.1% of hospitalized patients with melioidosis. Older age and AKI are associated with a higher incidence of hyponatremia. The presence of severehyponatremia is an independent predictor of in-hospital mortality, need formechanical ventilation and ICU stay.

AB  - Introduction: Co-infection with different agents such as bacterial, viral, andRickettsia is being increasingly recognized due to greater availability andutilization of the diagnostic tests among malaria patients. Methods: Consecutive admitted malarial cases were included and were subjected to test for generalinvestigations, bacteria, typhoid, dengue, chikungunya, and rest for specificdiagnosis. All patients were followed up till discharge or death and appropriate statistical tests were performed. Results: A total of 152 malaria patients wererecruited and 27 (18.8%) had concurrent infections. It included 40.7% dengueonly, 18.7% pneumonia, 11.1% urinary tract infection (UTI), 7.4% enteric fever,3.7% leptospirosis, chikungunya, and tuberculous meningitis each, and 3.7% eachof dengue with pneumonia and UTI. The organisms isolated were Streptococcuspneumoniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, andMycobacterium tuberculosis. The mean duration of fever was 6.33 +/- 3.63 dayswith a range of 3-20 days. Blood culture grew in 2 cases S. typhi and K.pneumonia,e. Dengue co-infections had significantly higher clinical andlaboratory features of dengue and complications such as bleeding, jaundice, andcholecystitis, whereas rest concurrent infections had a significantly higherproportion of nausea and vomiting, convulsion, altered sensorium, productivecough, urinary symptoms, shock, acute kidney injury, anemia, and mean neutrophil count. There was significantly higher mortality among malaria-dengue concurrentinfection group with 2 (15.4%) than malaria mono-infection group 3 (2.4%).Conclusion: Co-infections with malaria are not uncommon, especially dengue fever and other bacterial infections. The dominant clinical picture is of thesuperimposed infection. Decision should be clinically guided adjunct withspecific diagnostic tests, and timely treatment has favorable outcome.

AB  - Introduction: Ivermectin, hydroxychloroquine (HQ), and darunavir/ritonavir arewidely prescribed as an oral treatment for severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection despite their uncertainty of clinicalbenefit. The objective is to determine the safety and the efficacies of twotreatment regimens against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We conducted anopen-labeled, randomized, controlled trial to compare the efficacy between a3-day course of once-daily high-dose oral ivermectin plus zinc sulfate (Group A) and a combination of HQ, darunavir/ritonavir, and zinc sulfate (HQ +antiretroviral, Group B) for 5 days in asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infection.The study period was between December 2020 and April 2021. Results: Overall, 113 patients were randomized and analyzed (57 patients in Group A and 56 patients in Group B). The median duration to achieve the virological outcome of eitherundetected or cycle threshold (Ct) for N gene of SARS-CoV-2 by real-timepolymerase chain reaction was 6 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.3-6.7)versus 7 days (95% CI: 5.4-8.6) in Group A and Group B, respectively (P = 0.419) in the modified intention-to-treat population. All patients were discharged from hospital quarantine as planned. Two patients in Group A and one patient in Group B were considered clinically worsening and received 10 days of favipiravirtreatment. There was no serious adverse event found in both groups. Conclusion:We demonstrated that both treatment regimens were safe, but both treatmentregimens had no virological or clinical benefit. Based on this result and currentdata, there is no supporting evidence for the clinical benefit of ivermectin for coronavirus-19.

AB  - The survival rate of colorectal cancer patients is adversely affected by theselection of tumors resistant to conventional anti-cancer drugs such as5-fluorouracil (5FU). Although there is mounting evidence that commensal gutmicrobiota is essential for effective colon cancer treatment, the detailedmolecular mechanisms and the role of gut microbial metabolites remain elusive.The goal of this study is to decipher the impact and mechanisms of gut microbial metabolite, urolithin A (UroA) and its structural analogue, UAS03 on reversal of 5FU-resistant (5FUR) colon cancers. Methods: We have utilized the SW480 andHCT-116 parental (5FU-sensitive) and 5FUR colon cancer cells to examine thechemosensitization effects of UroA or UAS03 by using both in vitro and in vivomodels. The effects of mono (UroA/UAS03/5FU) and combinatorial therapy(UroA/UAS03 + 5FU) on cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration and invasion,regulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) mediators, expression andactivities of drug transporters, and their regulatory transcription factors were examined using molecular, cellular, immunological and flowcytometric methods.Further, the anti-tumor effects of mono/combination therapy (UroA or UAS03 or 5FUor UroA/UAS03 + 5FU) were examined using pre-clinical models of 5FUR-tumorxenografts in NRGS mice and azoxymethane (AOM)-dextran sodium sulfate(DSS)-induced colon tumors. Results: Our data showed that UroA or UAS03 incombination with 5FU significantly inhibited cell viability, proliferation,invasiveness as well as induced apoptosis of the 5FUR colon cancer cells comparedto mono treatments. Mechanistically, UroA or UAS03 chemosensitized the 5FURcancer cells by downregulating the expression and activities of drug transporters(MDR1, BCRP, MRP2 and MRP7) leading to a decrease in the efflux of 5FU. Further, our data suggested the UroA or UAS03 chemosensitized 5FUR cancer cells to 5FUtreatment through regulating FOXO3-FOXM1 axis. Oral treatment with UroA or UAS03 in combination with low dose i.p. 5FU significantly reduced the growth of5FUR-tumor xenografts in NRGS mice. Further, combination therapy significantlyabrogated colonic tumors in AOM-DSS-induced colon tumors in mice. Conclusions: Insummary, gut microbial metabolite UroA and its structural analogue UAS03chemosensitized the 5FUR colon cancers for effective 5FU chemotherapy. This studyprovided the novel characteristics of gut microbial metabolites to havesignificant translational implications in drug-resistant cancer therapeutics.

AB  - Megapodius reinwardt, the orange-footed scrubfowl, belongs to a small family ofbirds that inhabits the Indo-Australian region. Megapodes are unique inincubating their eggs in mounds using heat from microbial decomposition oforganic materials and solar radiation. Little is known about the microorganismsinvolved in the decomposition of organic matter in mounds. To determine thesource of microbes in the mounds, we used 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequencing tocharacterize the microbial communities of mound soil, adjacent soil and scrubfowlfaeces. We found that the microbial communities of scrubfowl faeces weresubstantially different from those of the mounds and surrounding soils,suggesting that scrubfowls probably do not use their faeces to inoculate theirmounds although a few microbial sequence variants were present in both faeces andmound samples. Further, the mound microbial community structure was significantlydifferent to the adjacent soils. For example, mounds had a high relativeabundance of sequence variants belonging to Thermomonosporaceae, a thermophilicsoil bacteria family able to degrade cellulose from plant residues. It is notclear whether members of Thermomonosporaceae disproportionately contribute to thegeneration of heat in the mound, or whether they simply thrive in the warm mound environment created by the metabolic activity of the mound microbial community.The lack of clarity in the literature between designations of heat-producing(thermogenic) and heat-thriving (thermophilic) microbes poses a challenge tounderstanding the role of specific bacteria and fungi in incubation.

PG  - e13770
LID - 10.7717/peerj.13770 [doi]
AB  - Background: Panax notoginseng is an important herbal medicine in China, wherethis crop is cultivated by replanting of seedlings. Root rot disease threatensthe sustainability of P. notoginseng cultivation. Water flooding (WF) is widelyused to control numerous soilborne diseases, and biogas slurry shows positiveeffects on the soil physiochemical properties and microbial community structureand has the potential to suppress soilborne pathogens. Hence, biogas slurryflooding (BSF) may be an effective approach for alleviating root rot disease ofP. notoginseng; however, the underlying mechanism needs to be elucidated.Methods: In this study, we conducted a microcosm experiment to determine if BSFcan reduce the abundance of pathogens in soil and, alleviate root rot of P.notoginseng. Microcosms, containing soil collected from a patch of P. notoginsengshowing symptoms of root rot disease, were subjected to WF or BSF at twoconcentrations for two durations (15 and 30 days), after which the changes intheir physicochemical properties were investigated. Culturable microorganisms andthe root rot ratio were also estimated. We next compared changes in the microbialcommunity structure of soils under BSF with changes in WF and untreated soilsthrough high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA (16S) and fungalinternal transcribed spacer (ITS) genes amplicon. Results: WF treatment did notobviously change the soil microbiota. In contrast, BSF treatment significantlyaltered the physicochemical properties and reshaped the bacterial and fungalcommunities, reduced the relative abundance of potential fungal pathogens(Fusarium, Cylindrocarpon, Alternaria, and Phoma), and suppressed culturablefungi and Fusarium. The changes in the microbial community structure correspondedto decreased root rot ratios. The mechanisms of fungal pathogen suppression byBSF involved several factors, including inducing anaerobic/conductive conditions,altering the soil physicochemical properties, enriching the anaerobic andculturable bacteria, and increasing the phylogenetic relatedness of the bacterialcommunity. Conclusions: BSF application can reshape the soil microbial community,reduce the abundance of potential pathogens, and alleviate root rot in P.notoginseng. Thus, it is a promising practice for controlling root rot disease inP. notoginseng.

AB  - Bioimaging techniques are of increasing importance in clinical and relatedfields, which also have been successfully applied in the in vivo/in vitro imagingsystem. Due to the vital factor of enzymes in biological systems,enzyme-activated fluorophores, which could turn "on" the fluorescence signal froman "off" state, offer non-invasive and effective potential for the accuratebioimaging of particular cells, tissues, or bacteria. Comparing with thetraditional imaging probes, enzyme-activated organic small fluorophores canvisualize living cells within small animals with high sensitivity, high imagingresolution, non-invasiveness, and real-time feedback. In this mini review,well-designed enzyme-activated organic fluorescent probes with multiple functionsare exclusively reviewed through the latest development and progress, focusing onprobe design strategy, fluorescence property, enzyme activation process, andbioimaging applications. It is worth noting that multi-enzyme-activatedstrategies, which could avoid the production of "false-positive" signals incomplex biological systems, effectively provide high selective and real-timebioimaging, indicating the exciting potential of intraoperative fluorescenceimaging and diagnosis tools.

AB  - Phage has high specificity for its host recognition. As a natural enemy ofbacteria, it has been used to treat super bacteria many times. Identifying phage proteins from the original sequence is very important for understanding therelationship between phage and host bacteria and developing new antimicrobialagents. However, traditional experimental methods are both expensive andtime-consuming. In this study, an ensemble learning-based feature selectionmethod is proposed to find important features for phage protein identification.The method uses four types of protein sequence-derived features, quantifies theimportance of each feature by adding perturbations to the features to influencethe results, and finally splices the important features among the four types offeatures. In addition, we analyzed the selected features and their biologicalsignificance.

AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is an important crop that is mainly used in the foodindustry. This study using the metabolome and microbiome investigates theresistance factors of wild tea plant resources against tea gray blight disease,which is caused by Pestalotiopsis theae (Sawada) Steyaert. According to theinteraction analysis of tea leaves and pathogenic fungus, the resistance of wild tea plant resource "R1" (Resistance 1) to tea gray blight disease wassignificantly higher than that of wild tea plant resource "S1" (Susceptibility1). The difference between "R1" and "S1" in the metabolome was obvious. Therewere 145 metabolites that significantly changed. The phenolic acids andflavonoids were the major increased categories in "R1," and it included4-O-glucosyl-sinapate and petunidin-3-o-(6"-o-p-coumaroyl) rutinoside. Sixmetabolic pathways were significantly enriched, including aminoacyl-tRNAbiosynthesis, flavone, and flavonol biosynthesis. In terms of bacteria, there wasno significant difference between "S1" and "R1" in the principal componentanalysis (PCA). Pseudomonas was the major bacterial genus in "S1" and "R1." Inaddition, each of the two resources had its own predominant genus: Cellvibiriowas a predominant bacterial genus in "S1" and Candidatus_competibacter was apredominant bacterial genus in "R1." In terms of fungi, the fungal diversity and the abundance of the two tea plant resource samples could be distinguishedclearly. The fungal component of "S1" was more abundant than that of "R1" at the genus level. Toxicocladosporium was the predominant fungal genus of "S1," andFilobasidium was the predominant fungal genus of "R1." The relative abundance of unclassified-norank-norank-Chloroplast and Penicillium were significantlydifferent between "S1" and "R1." Penicillium was identified as a potentialbiomarker. They correlated with some metabolites enriched in "S1" or "R1," suchas L-arginine and quercetin-3-o-(2"-o-rhamnosyl) rutinoside-7-o-glucoside.Overall, phenolic acids, flavonoids, and Penicillium could be functionalmetabolites or microorganisms that contributed to improving the resistance ofwild tea plant resources to tea gray blight disease.

AB  - Two years after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), in December 2019, the first infections were identified in Wuhan city of China.SARS-CoV-2 infection caused a global pandemic and accordingly, 5.41 milliondeaths worldwide. Hence, developing a safe and efficient vaccine for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) seems to be an urgent need. Attempts to produce efficientvaccines inexhaustibly are ongoing. At present time, according to the COVID-19vaccine tracker and landscape provided by World Health Organization (WHO), there are 161 vaccine candidates in different clinical phases all over the world. Inbetween, protein subunit vaccines are types of vaccines that contain a viralprotein like spike protein or its segment as the antigen assumed to elicithumoral and cellular immunity and good protective effects. Previously, thistechnology of vaccine manufacturing was used in a recombinant influenza vaccine(RIV4). In the present work, we review protein subunit vaccines passing theirphase 3 and 4 clinical trials, population participated in these trials, vaccines manufactures, vaccines efficiency and their side effects, and other features ofthese vaccines.

TI  - The Unique Seed Protein Composition of Quality Protein Popcorn Promotes Growth ofBeneficial Bacteria From the Human Gut Microbiome.
PG  - 921456
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.921456 [doi]
AB  - The effects of fiber, complex carbohydrates, lipids, and small molecules fromfood matrices on the human gut microbiome have been increasingly studied. Muchless is known about how dietary protein can influence the composition andfunction of the gut microbial community. Here, we used near-isogenic maize lines of conventional popcorn and quality-protein popcorn (QPP) to study the effects ofthe opaque-2 mutation and associated quality-protein modifiers on the human gutmicrobiome. Opaque-2 blocks the synthesis of major maize seed proteins(alpha-zeins), resulting in a compensatory synthesis of new seed proteins thatare nutritionally beneficial with substantially higher levels of the essentialamino acids lysine and tryptophan. We show that QPP lines stimulate greateramounts of butyrate production by human gut microbiomes in in vitro fermentation of popped and digested corn from parental and QPP hybrids. In human gutmicrobiomes derived from diverse individuals, bacterial taxa belonging to thebutyrate-producing family Lachnospiraceae, including the genera Coprococcus andRoseburia were consistently increased when fermenting QPP vs. parental popcornlines. We conducted molecular complementation to further demonstrate thatlysine-enriched seed protein can stimulate growth and butyrate production bymicrobes through distinct pathways. Our data show that organisms such asCoprococcus can utilize lysine and that other gut microbes, such as Roseburiaspp., instead, utilize fructoselysine produced during thermal processing(popping) of popcorn. Thus, the combination of seed composition in QPP andinteraction of protein adducts with carbohydrates during thermal processing canstimulate the growth of health-promoting, butyrate-producing organisms in thehuman gut microbiome through multiple pathways.

AB  - Understanding phage-host relationships is crucial for the study of virus biology and the application of phages in biotechnology and medicine. However, informationconcerning the range of hosts for bacterial and archaeal viruses is scatteredacross numerous databases and is difficult to obtain. Therefore, here we present PHD (Phage & Host Daily), a web application that offers a comprehensive,up-to-date catalog of known phage-host associations that allows users to selectviruses targeting specific bacterial and archaeal taxa of interest. Our servicecombines the latest information on virus-host interactions from seven sourcedatabases with current taxonomic classification retrieved directly from thegroups and institutions responsible for its maintenance. The web application alsoprovides summary statistics on host and virus diversity, their pairwiseinteractions, and the host range of deposited phages. PHD is updated daily andavailable at http://phdaily.info or http://combio.pl/phdaily.

AB  - Powdered infant formula (PIF) can be contaminated with Cronobacter sakazakii,which can cause severe illnesses in infants. Synbiotics, a combination ofprobiotics and prebiotics, could act as an alternative control measure for C.sakazakii contamination in PIF and within the infant gut, but synbiotics have notbeen well studied for their ability to inhibit C. sakazakii. Using a Simulator ofthe Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem (SHIME((R))) inoculated with infantfecal matter, we demonstrated that a potential synbiotic, consisting of sixlactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains and Vivinal GOS, can inhibit the growth of C. sakazakii in an infant possibly through either the production of antimicrobialmetabolites like acetate, increasing species diversity within the SHIMEcompartments to compete for nutrients or a combination of mechanisms. Using atriple SHIME set-up, i.e., three identical SHIME compartments, the first SHIME(SHIME 1) was designated as the control SHIME in the absence of a treatment,whereas SHIME 2 and 3 were the treated SHIME over 2, 1-week treatment periods.The addition of the potential synbiotic (LAB + VGOS) resulted in a significantdecrease in C. sakazakii levels within 1 week (p < 0.05), but in the absence of atreatment the significant decline took 2 weeks (p < 0.05), and the LAB treatment did not decrease C. sakazakii levels (p >/= 0.05). The principal componentanalysis showed a distinction between metabolomic profiles for the control andLAB treatment, but similar profiles for the LAB + VGOS treatment. The addition ofthe potential synbiotic (LAB + VGOS) in the first treatment period slightlyincreased species diversity (p >/= 0.05) compared to the control and LAB, whichmay have had an effect on the survival of C. sakazakii throughout the treatmentperiod. Our results also revealed that the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was negatively correlated with Cronobacter when no treatments were added (rho =-0.96; p < 0.05). These findings suggest that C. sakazakii could be inhibited by the native gut microbiota, and inhibition can be accelerated by the potentialsynbiotic treatment.

AB  - As much as 400 Tg of carbon from airborne semivolatile aromatic hydrocarbons isdeposited to the oceans every year, the largest identified source ofanthropogenic organic carbon to the ocean. Microbial degradation is a key sink ofthese pollutants in surface waters, but has received little attention in polarenvironments. We have challenged Antarctic microbial communities from thesea-surface microlayer (SML) and the subsurface layer (SSL) with polycyclicaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at environmentally relevant concentrations. PAHdegradation rates and the microbial responses at both taxonomical and functional levels were assessed. Evidence for faster removal rates was observed in the SML, with rates 2.6-fold higher than in the SSL. In the SML, the highest removal rateswere observed for the more hydrophobic and particle-bound PAHs. After 24 h ofPAHs exposure, particle-associated bacteria in the SML showed the highest number of significant changes in their composition. These included significantenrichments of several hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria, especially the fast-growing genera Pseudoalteromonas, which increased their relative abundances by eightfold.Simultaneous metatranscriptomic analysis showed that the free-living fraction of SML was the most active fraction, especially for members of the orderAlteromonadales, which includes Pseudoalteromonas. Their key role in PAHsbiodegradation in polar environments should be elucidated in further studies.This study highlights the relevant role of bacterial populations inhabiting thesea-surface microlayer, especially the particle-associated habitat, as relevantbioreactors for the removal of aromatic hydrocarbons in the oceans.

PG  - 866705
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.866705 [doi]
AB  - The emergence and spread of new HIV-1 variants pose a challenge for theeffectiveness of antiretrovirals (ARV) targeting Pol proteins. During viralevolution, non-synonymous mutations have fixed along the viral genome, leading toamino acid (aa) changes that can be variant-specific (V-markers). Those V-markersfixed in positions associated with drug resistance mutations (DRM), or R-markers,can impact drug susceptibility and resistance pathways. All available HIV-1 Polsequences from ARV-naive subjects were downloaded from the United States LosAlamos HIV Sequence Database, selecting 59,733 protease (PR), 6,437retrotranscriptase (RT), and 6,059 integrase (IN) complete sequences ascribed to the four HIV-1 groups and group M subtypes and circulating recombinant forms(CRFs). Using a bioinformatics tool developed in our laboratory (EpiMolBio), weinferred the consensus sequences for each Pol protein and HIV-1 variant toanalyze the aa conservation in Pol. We analyzed the Wu-Kabat protein variability coefficient (WK) in PR, RT, and IN group M to study the susceptibility of eachsite to evolutionary replacements. We identified as V-markers thevariant-specific aa changes present in >75% of the sequences in variants with >5 available sequences, considering R-markers those V-markers that corresponded toDRM according to the IAS-USA2019 and Stanford-Database 9.0. The mean aaconservation of HIV-1 and group M consensus was 82.60%/93.11% in PR,88.81%/94.07% in RT, and 90.98%/96.02% in IN. The median group M WK was 10 in PR,4 in RT, and 5 in IN. The residues involved in binding or catalytic sites showed a variability <0.5%. We identified 106 V-markers: 31 in PR, 28 in RT, and 47 inIN, present in 11, 12, and 13 variants, respectively. Among them, eight (7.5%)were R-markers, present in five variants, being minor DRM with little potentialeffect on ARV susceptibility. We present a thorough analysis of Pol variabilityamong all HIV-1 variants circulating to date. The relatively high aa conservationobserved in Pol proteins across HIV-1 variants highlights their critical role in the viral cycle. However, further studies are needed to understand the V-markers'impact on the Pol proteins structure, viral cycle, or treatment strategies, andperiodic variability surveillance studies are also required to understand PR, RT,and IN evolution.

AB  - We have previously studied carbapenem non-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa(CNPA) strains from intensive care units (ICUs) in a referral hospital inJakarta, Indonesia (Pelegrin et al., 2019). We documented that CNPA transmissionsand acquisitions among patients were variable over time and that these were notsignificantly reduced by a set of infection control measures. Three high riskinternational CNPA clones (sequence type (ST)235, ST823, ST357) dominated, andcarbapenem resistance was due to carbapenemase-encoding genes and mutations inthe porin OprD. Pelegrin et al. (2019) reported core genome analysis of thesestrains. We present a more refined and detailed whole genome-based analysis ofmajor clones represented in the same dataset. As per our knowledge, this is thefirst study reporting Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (wgSNP) analysis ofPseudomonas strains. With whole genome-based Multi Locus Sequence Typing (wgMLST)of the 3 CNPA clones (ST235, ST357 and ST823), three to eleven subgroups with up to 200 allelic variants were observed for each of the CNPA clones. Furthermore,we analyzed these CNPA clone clusters for the presence of wgSNP to redefine CNPA transmission events during hospitalization. A maximum number 35350 SNPs(including non-informative wgSNPs) and 398 SNPs (ST-specific_informative-wgSNPs) were found in ST235, 34,570 SNPs (including non-informative wgSNPs) and 111 SNPs (ST-specific_informative-wgSNPs) in ST357 and 26,443 SNPs (includingnon-informative SNPs) and 61 SNPs (ST-specific_informative-wgSNPs) in ST823.ST-specific_Informative-wgSNPs were commonly noticed in sensor-response regulatorgenes. However, the majority of non-informative wgSNPs was found in conservedhypothetical proteins or in uncharacterized proteins. Of note, antibioticresistance and virulence genes segregated according to the wgSNP analyses. Atotal of 8 transmission chains for ST235 strains followed by 9 and 4 possibletransmission chains for ST357 and ST823 were traceable on the basis of pairwisedistances of informative-wgSNPs (0 to 4 SNPs) among the strains. The presentstudy demonstrates the value of detailed whole genome sequence analysis forhighly refined epidemiological analysis of P. aeruginosa.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.921549 [doi]
AB  - In the cold regions of China, lignin-rich corn straw accumulates at high levelsdue to low temperatures. The application of psychrotrophic lignin-degradingbacteria should be an effective means of overcoming the low-temperature limit forlignin degradation and promoting the utilization of corn straw. However, thisapplication is limited by the lack of suitable strains for decomposition oflignin; furthermore, the metabolic mechanism of psychrotrophic lignin-degradingbacteria is unclear. Here, the whole genome of the psychrotrophiclignin-degrading bacterium Arthrobacter sp. C2, isolated in our previous work,was sequenced. Comparative genomics revealed that C2 contained unique genesrelated to lignin degradation and low-temperature adaptability. DyP mayparticipate in lignin degradation and may be a cold-adapted enzyme. Moreover, DyPwas proven to catalyze lignin Calpha-Cbeta bond cleavage. Deletion andcomplementation of the DyP gene verified its ability to catalyze the first-stepreaction of lignin degradation. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed thatthe transcriptional expression of the DyP gene was upregulated, and the geneticcompensation mechanism allowed C2DeltaDyP to degrade lignin, which provided novelinsights into the survival strategy of the psychrotrophic mutant strainC2DeltadyP. This study improved our understanding of the metabolic mechanism ofpsychrotrophic lignin-degrading bacteria and provided potential applicationoptions for energy-saving production using cold-adapted lignin-degrading enzymes.

PG  - 881508
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.881508 [doi]
AB  - Background: Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare genetic disorder characterizedby the development of pigmented spots and gastrointestinal polyps and increasedsusceptibility to cancers. It remains unknown whether gut microbiota dysbiosis islinked to PJS. Aim: This study aimed to assess the structure and composition ofthe gut microbiota, including both bacteria and fungi, in patients with PJS andinvestigate the relationship between gut microbiota dysbiosis and PJSpathogenesis. Methods: The bacterial and fungal composition of the fecalmicrobiota was analyzed in 23 patients with PJS (cases), 17 first-degreeasymptomatic relatives (ARs), and 24 healthy controls (HCs) using 16S (MiSeq) andITS2 (pyrosequencing) sequencing for bacteria and fungi, respectively.Differential analyses of the intestinal flora were performed from the phylum tospecies level. Results: Alpha-diversity distributions of bacteria and fungiindicated that the abundance of both taxa differed between PJS cases andcontrols. However, while the diversity and composition of fecal bacteria in PJScases were significantly different from those in ARs and HCs, fungal flora wasmore stable. High-throughput sequencing confirmed the special characteristics andbiodiversity of the fecal bacterial and fungal microflora in patients with PJS.They had lower bacterial biodiversity than controls, with a higher frequency ofthe Proteobacteria phylum, Enterobacteriaceae family, and Escherichia-Shigellagenus, and a lower frequency of the Firmicutes phylum and the Lachnospiraceae andRuminococcaceae families. Of fungi, Candida was significantly higher in PJS casesthan in controls. Conclusion: The findings reported here confirm gut microbiotadysbiosis in patients with PJS. This is the first report on the bacterial andfungal microbiota profile of subjects with PJS, which may be meaningful toprovide a structural basis for further research on intestinal microecology inPJS.

AB  - Depending on their tree species composition, forests recruit different soilmicrobial communities. Likewise, the vertical nutrient gradient along soilprofiles impacts these communities and their activities. In forest soils,bacteria and fungi commonly compete, coexist, and interact, which is challenging for understanding the complex mechanisms behind microbial structuring. Usingamplicon sequencing, we analyzed bacterial and fungal diversity in relation toforest composition and soil depth. Moreover, employing random forest models, weidentified microbial indicator taxa of forest plots composed of either deciduous or evergreen trees, or their mixtures, as well as of three soil depths. Weexpected that forest composition and soil depth affect bacterial and fungaldiversity and community structure differently. Indeed, relative abundances ofmicrobial communities changed more across soil depths than in relation to forest composition. The microbial Shannon diversity was particularly affected by soildepth and by the proportion of evergreen trees. Our results also reflected thatbacterial communities are primarily shaped by soil depth, while fungi wereinfluenced by forest tree species composition. An increasing proportion ofevergreen trees did not provoke differences in main bacterial metabolicfunctions, e.g., carbon fixation, degradation, or photosynthesis. However,significant responses related to specialized bacterial metabolisms were detected.Saprotrophic, arbuscular mycorrhizal, and plant pathogenic fungi were related to the proportion of evergreen trees, particularly in topsoil. Prominent microbialindicator taxa in the deciduous forests were characterized to be r-strategists,whereas K-strategists dominated evergreen plots. Considering simultaneouslyforest composition and soil depth to unravel differences in microbialcommunities, metabolic pathways and functional guilds have the potential toenlighten mechanisms that maintain forest soil functionality and provideresistance against disturbances.

AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of gut bacteria in thedevelopment of malignancy, while relatively little research has been done on gut mycobiota. As a part of the gut microbiome, the percentage of gut mycobiota isnegligible compared to gut bacteria. However, the effect of gut fungi on humanhealth and disease is significant. This review systematically summarizes theresearch progress on mycobiota, especially gut fungi, in patients with head andneck cancer (HNC), esophageal cancer (EC), gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer(CRC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), pancreatic cancer, melanoma, breastcancer, and lung carcinoma-induced cachexia. Moreover, we also describe, for the first time in detail, the role of the fungal recognition receptors, C-type lectinreceptors (CLRs) (Dectin-1, Dectin-2, Dectin-3, and Mincle) and their downstream effector caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9), in tumors toprovide a reference for further research on intestinal fungi in the diagnosis andtreatment of malignant tumors.

AB  - Natural products from actinomycetes serve as a crucial source of clinicalpharmaceuticals, especially antibiotics and anticancer agents. Among them,polycyclic xanthones belong to a growing group of highly oxygenated aromaticpolyketides with a xanthone-containing angular hexacyclic framework. Thesebiosynthetically unique small molecules are of great interest due to their widespectrum of biological activities, especially the remarkable antibacterialactivity against gram-positive bacteria and the significant antineoplasticeffects toward various cancer cells at nanomolar concentrations. Their complexstructures and significant bioactivities have aroused considerable attention inthe chemical and biological communities in recent decades. This review covers theisolation, the biosynthesis, and the biological studies toward these structurallycomplex and biologically active molecules.

AB  - Systemic characterization of the human gut microbiota highlighted its vasttherapeutic potential. Despite having enormous potential, the non-availability oftheir culture representatives created a bottleneck to understand the concept ofmicrobiome-based therapeutics. The present study is aimed to isolate and evaluatethe probiotic potential of a human gut isolate. Physiochemical, morphological,and phylogenetic characterization of a human gut isolate identifies it as arod-shaped gram-negative microbe taxonomically affiliated with the Cytobacillusgenus, having an optimal growth at 37 degrees C in a partially alkalineenvironment (pH 8.0). This human gut isolate showed continuous growth in thepresence of salts (up to 7% NaCl and 10% KCl), antibiotics, metals and metalloids[silver nitrate (up to 2 mM); lead acetate (up to 2 mM); sodium arsenate (up to10 mM); potassium dichromate (up to 2 mM)], gastric and intestinal conditions,diverse temperature (25-50 degrees C), and pH (5-9) conditions making it fit tosurvive in the highly variable gut environment. Genomic characterizationidentified the presence of gene clusters for diverse bio-catalytic activity,stress response, and antimicrobial activity, as well as it indicated the absence of pathogenic gene islands. A combination of functional features likeanti-amylase, anti-lipase, glutenase, prolyl endopeptidase, lactase, bile salthydrolase, cholesterol oxidase, and anti-pathogenic activity is indicative of itsprobiotic potential in various disorders. This was further substantiated by theCaCo-2 cell line assay confirming its cellular adherence and biosafety.Conclusively, human gut isolate possessed significant probiotic potential thatcan be used to promote animal and human health.

AB  - Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming the new standard for bacterialhigh-resolution typing and the performance of laboratories is being evaluated in interlaboratory comparisons. The use of the Illumina Nextera XT librarypreparation kit has been found to be associated with poorer performance due to a GC-content-dependent coverage bias. The bias is especially strong when sequencinglow GC-content species. Here, we have made an in-depth analysis of the Nextera XTcoverage bias problem using data from a proficiency test of the low GC-contentspecies Campylobacter jejuni. We have compared Nextera XT with Nextera Flex/DNAPrep and examined the consequences on downstream WGS analysis when usingdifferent quantities of raw data. We have also analyzed how the coverage biasrelates to differential usage of tagmentation cleavage sites. We found that thetagmentation site was characterized by a symmetrical motif with a central AT-richregion surrounded by Gs and Cs. The Gs and Cs appeared to be the main determinantfor cleavage efficiency and the genomic regions that were associated with lowcoverage only contained low-efficiency cleavage sites. This explains why lowGC-content genomes and regions are more subjected to coverage bias. Wefurthermore extended our analysis to other datasets representing other bacterial species. We visualized how the coverage bias was large in low GC-content species such as C. jejuni, C. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes,whereas species with neutral GC-content such as Salmonella enterica andEscherichia coli were only affected in certain regions. Species with highGC-content such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa werehardly affected at all. The coverage bias associated with Nextera XT was notfound when Nextera Flex/DNA Prep had been used.

TI  - Cable Bacteria Activity Modulates Arsenic Release From Sediments in a Seasonally Hypoxic Marine Basin.
PG  - 907976
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.907976 [doi]
AB  - Eutrophication and global change are increasing the occurrence of seasonalhypoxia (bottom-water oxygen concentration <63 muM) in coastal systems worldwide.In extreme cases, the bottom water can become completely anoxic, allowing sulfideto escape from the sediments and leading to the development of bottom-watereuxinia. In seasonally hypoxic coastal basins, electrogenic sulfur oxidation bylong, filamentous cable bacteria has been shown to stimulate the formation of an iron oxide layer near the sediment-water interface, while the bottom waters areoxygenated. Upon the development of bottom-water anoxia, this iron oxide"firewall" prevents the sedimentary release of sulfide. Iron oxides also act asan adsorption trap for elements such as arsenic. Arsenic is a toxic trace metal, and its release from sediments can have a negative impact on marine ecosystems.Yet, it is currently unknown how electrogenic sulfur oxidation impacts arseniccycling in seasonally hypoxic basins. In this study, we presented results from a seasonal field study of an uncontaminated marine lake, complemented with along-term sediment core incubation experiment, which reveals that cable bacteria have a strong impact on the arsenic cycle in a seasonally hypoxic system.Electrogenic sulfur oxidation significantly modulates the arsenic fluxes over aseasonal time scale by enriching arsenic in the iron oxide layer near thesediment-water interface in the oxic period and pulse-releasing arsenic duringthe anoxic period. Fluxes as large as 20 mumol m(-2) day(-1) were measured, whichare comparable to As fluxes reported from highly contaminated sediments. Sincecable bacteria are recognized as active components of the microbial community in seasonally hypoxic systems worldwide, this seasonal amplification of arsenicfluxes is likely a widespread phenomenon.

AB  - Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram-positive facultative intracellular bacteriumwith a broad host range. With its housekeeping sigma factor and four alternative ones (namely SigB, SigC, SigH, and SigL), L. monocytogenes can express genes inresponse to changing environments. However, the roles of these sigma factors inintracellular survival are still unclear. The objectives of this study were tocharacterize the role of each alternative sigma factor on L. monocytogenesinvasion and growth inside human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma Caco-2cells. We used L. monocytogenes 10403S wild type and its 15 alternative sigmafactor deletion mutants at a multiplicity of infection of 100 and 1 in invasionand intracellular growth assays in the Caco-2 cells, respectively. At 1.5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h post-infection, Caco-2 cells were lysed, and intracellular L. monocytogenes were enumerated on brain-heart infusion agar. Colony-forming andgrowth rates were compared among strains. The results from phenotypiccharacterization confirmed that (i) SigB is the key factor for L. monocytogenesinvasion and (ii) having only SigA (DeltasigBCHL strain) is sufficient to invade and multiply in the host cell at similar levels as the wild type. Our previousstudy suggested the negative role of SigL in bile stress response. In this study,we have shown that additional deletion of the rpoN (or sigL) gene to DeltasigB,DeltasigC, or DeltasigH could restore the impaired invasion efficiencies of thesingle mutant, suggesting the absence of SigL could enhance host invasion.Therefore, we further investigated the role of SigL during extracellular andintracellular life cycles. Using RNA sequencing, we identified 118 and 16SigL-dependent genes during the extracellular and intracellular life cycles,respectively. The sigL gene itself was induced by fivefolds prior to theinvasion, and 5.3 folds during Caco-2 infection, further suggesting the role ofSigL in intracellular growth.

PG  - 929346
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.929346 [doi]
AB  - The intestinal barrier is a structure that prevents harmful substances, such asbacteria and endotoxins, from penetrating the intestinal wall and entering human tissues, organs, and microcirculation. It can separate colonizing microbes fromsystemic tissues and prevent the invasion of pathogenic bacteria. Pathologicalconditions such as shock, trauma, stress, and inflammation damage the intestinal barrier to varying degrees, aggravating the primary disease. Intestinalprobiotics are a type of active microorganisms beneficial to the health of thehost and an essential element of human health. Reportedly, intestinal probiotics can affect the renewal of intestinal epithelial cells, and also make cellconnections closer, increase the production of tight junction proteins andmucins, promote the development of the immune system, regulate the release ofintestinal antimicrobial peptides, compete with pathogenic bacteria for nutrientsand living space, and interact with the host and intestinal commensal flora torestore the intestinal barrier. In this review, we provide a comprehensiveoverview of how intestinal probiotics restore the intestinal barrier to providenew ideas for treating intestinal injury-related diseases.

AB  - Bacteria often change their genetic and physiological traits to survive in harsh environments. To determine whether, in various strains of Burkholderia glumae,genomic diversity is associated with the ability to adapt to ever-changingenvironments, whole genomes of 44 isolates from different hosts and regions were analyzed. Whole-genome phylogenetic analysis of the 44 isolates revealed sixclusters and two divisions. While all isolates possessed chromosomes 1 and 2,strains BGR80S and BGR81S had one chromosome resulting from the merging of thetwo chromosomes. Upon comparison of genomic structures to the prototype BGR1,inversions, deletions, and rearrangements were found within or betweenchromosomes 1 and/or 2 in the other isolates. When three isolates-BGR80S, BGR15S,and BGR21S, representing clusters III, IV, and VI, respectively-were grown inLuria-Bertani medium, spontaneous null mutations were identified in qsmR encodinga quorum-sensing master regulator. Six days after subculture, qsmR mutants werefound at detectable frequencies in BGR15S and BGR21S, and reached approximately40% at 8 days after subculture. However, the qsmR mutants appeared 2 days aftersubculture in BGR80S and dominated the population, reaching almost 80%. No qsmRmutant was detected at detectable frequency in BGR1 or BGR13S. The spontaneousqsmR mutants outcompeted their parental strains in the co-culture. Daily additionof glucose or casamino acids to the batch cultures of BGR80S delayed emergence ofqsmR mutants and significantly reduced their incidence. These results indicatethat spontaneous qsmR mutations are correlated with genomic structures andnutritional conditions.

TI  - Salmonella Phages Affect the Intestinal Barrier in Chicks by Altering theComposition of Early Intestinal Flora: Association With Time of Phage Use.
PG  - 947640
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.947640 [doi]
AB  - Phages show promise in replacing antibiotics to treat or prevent bacterialdiseases in the chicken breeding industry. Chicks are easily affected by theirenvironment during early growth. Thus, this study investigated whether oralphages could affect the intestinal barrier function of chicks with a focus on thececal microbiome. In a two-week trial, forty one-day-old hens were randomlydivided into four groups: (1) NC, negative control; (2) Phage 1, 10(9) PFUphage/day (days 3-5); (3) Phage 2, 10(9) PFU phage/day (days 8-10); and (4) AMX, 1 mg/mL amoxicillin/day (days 8-10). High-throughput sequencing results of cecal contents showed that oral administration of phages significantly affectedmicrobial community structure and community composition, and increased therelative abundance of Enterococcus. The number of different species in the Phage 1 group was much higher than that in the Phage 2 group, and differences in alpha and beta diversity also indicated that the magnitude of changes in thecomposition of the cecal microbiota correlated with the time of phage use.Particularly in the first stage of cecal microbiota development, oraladministration of bacteriophages targeting Salmonella may cause substantialchanges in chicks, as evidenced by the results of the PICRUSt2 software function prediction, reminding us to be cautious about the time of phage use in chicks andto avoid high oral doses of phages during the first stage. Additionally, thePhage 2 samples not only showed a significant increase in the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium and Subdoligranulum, but also improved the intestinalmorphology (jejunum) and increased the mRNA expression level of occludin andZO-1. We concluded that phages do not directly interact with eukaryotic cells.The enhancement of intestinal barrier function by phages in chicks may be relatedto changes in the intestinal flora induced by phages. This implies that phagesmay affect intestinal health by regulating the intestinal flora. This studyprovides new ideas for phage prevention of intestinal bacterial infections andpromotes large-scale application of phages in the poultry industry.

AB  - Fermented foods have been an important component of the human diet from the time immemorial. It contains a high amount of probiotics that have been associated to a wide range of health benefits, including improved digestion and immunity. This review focuses on the indigenously prepared prebiotic- and probiotic-containingfunctional fermented rice (named Xaj-pani) by the Ahom Community from Assam, inNortheast India, including all the beneficial and potential effects on humanhealth. Literature was searched from scientific databases such as PubMed,ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. Glutinous rice (commonly known as bora rice of sali variety) is primarily employed to prepare beverages that are recoveredthrough the filtration process. The beer is normally consumed during religiousrites, festivals and ritual practices, as well as being used as a refreshinghealthy drink. Traditionally, it is prepared by incorporating a variety ofmedicinal herbs into their starter culture (Xaj-pitha) inoculum which is rich in yeasts, molds and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and then incorporated in alcoholicbeverage fermentation. The Ahom communities routinely consume this traditionally prepared alcoholic drink with no understanding of its quality and shelf life.Additionally, a finally produced dried cake, known as vekur pitha act as a sourceof Saccharomyces cerevisiae and can be stored for future use. Despite the rampantuse in this community, the relationship between Xaj-pani's consumption,immunological response, infectious and inflammatory processes remains unknown in the presence of factors unrelated or indirectly connected to immune function.Overall, this review provides the guidelines to promote the development ofprebiotic- and probiotic-containing functional fermented rice that couldsignificantly have an impact on the health of the consumers.

AB  - With the increasing bacterial resistance to traditional antibiotics, there is an urgent need for the development of alternative drugs or adjuvants of antibiotics to enhance antibacterial efficiency. The combination of antimicrobial peptides(AMPs) and traditional antibiotics is a potential alternative to enhanceantibacterial efficiency. In this study, we investigated the synergisticbactericidal effect of AMPs, including chicken (CATH-1,-2,-3, and -B1), mice(CRAMP), and porcine (PMAP-36 and PR-39) in combination with conventionalantibiotics containing ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, and erythromycinagainst Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteritidis, and Escherichia coli. The results showed that the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of CATH-1,-3 andPMAP-36 was lower than 10 muM, indicating that these three AMPs had goodbacterial activity against S. aureus, S. enteritidis, and E. coli. Then, thesynergistic antibacterial activity of AMPs and antibiotics combination wasdetermined by the fractional bactericidal concentration index (FBCI). The resultsshowed that the FBCI of AMPs (CATH-1,-3 and PMAP-36) and erythromycin was lowerthan 0.5 against bacterial pathogens, demonstrating that they had a synergisticbactericidal effect. Furthermore, the time-killing kinetics of AMPs (CATH-1,-3and PMAP-36) in combination with erythromycin showed that they had a continuouskilling effect on bacteria within 3 h. Notably, the combination showed lowerhemolytic activity and cytotoxicity to mammal cells compared to erythromycin and peptide alone treatment. In addition, the antibacterial mechanism of CATH-1 anderythromycin combination against E. coli was studied. The results of the scanningelectron microscope showed that CATH-1 enhanced the antibacterial activity oferythromycin by increasing the permeability of bacterial cell membrane. Moreover,the results of bacterial migration movement showed that the combination of CATH-1and erythromycin significantly inhibits the migration of E. coli. Finally, drugresistance analysis was performed and the results showed that CATH-1 delayed the emergence of E. coli resistance to erythromycin. In conclusion, the combinationof CATH-1 and erythromycin has synergistic antibacterial activity and reduces theemergence of bacterial drug resistance. Our study provides valuable informationto develop AMPs as potential substitutes or adjuvants for traditionalantibiotics.

AB  - Bacterial wilt caused by Ralstonia solanacearum is a fatal disease that affectsthe production of tomatoes and many other crops worldwide. As an effectivestrategy to manage bacterial wilt, biological control agents using plantgrowth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are being developed. In this study, wescreened 2,3-butanediol (BDO)-producing PGPR to control tomato bacterial wilt andinvestigated the action mechanism of the disease control agent. Of the 943strains isolated from soil, Klebsiella pneumoniae strain JCK-2201 produced thehighest concentration of 2,3-BDO. The culture broth of K. pneumoniae JCK-2201 didnot show any direct activity on R. solanacearum in vitro, but a 100-fold dilutioneffectively controlled tomato bacterial wilt with a control value of 77% in vivo.Fermentation utilizing K. pneumoniae JCK-2201 was optimized to produce 48 g/L of meso-2,3-BDO, which is 50% of the sucrose conversion efficiency. In addition, thecontrol efficacy and mechanism of meso-2,3-BDO produced by JCK-2201 in tomatobacterial wilt were determined by comparative analysis with Bacilluslicheniformis DSM13 producing meso-2,3-BDO and B. licheniformis DSM13 DeltaalsSthat did not produce 2,3-BDO, as the step of converting pyruvate toalpha-acetolactate was omitted. Tomato seedlings treated with the K. pneumoniaeJCK-2201 (500-fold dilution) and B. licheniformis DSM13 (100-fold dilution)culture broth produced meso-2,3-BDO that significantly reduced R.solanacearum-induced disease severity with control values of 55% and 63%,respectively. The formulated meso-2,3-BDO 9% soluble concentrate (SL; 1,000-fold dilution) showed 87% control against tomato bacterial wilt in the fieldcondition. Klebsiella pneumoniae JCK-2201 and B. licheniformis DSM13 treatmentinduced the expression of plant defense marker genes, such as LePR1, LePR2,LePR5, LePR3, and PI-II, in the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid signalingpathways at 4 days after inoculation. These results show that 2,3-BDO-producingbacteria and 2,3-BDO are potential biological control agents that act throughinduction of resistance for controlling tomato bacterial wilt.

TI  - Bartonella taylorii: A Model Organism for Studying Bartonella Infection in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 913434
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.913434 [doi]
AB  - Bartonella spp. are Gram-negative facultative intracellular pathogens that infectdiverse mammals and cause a long-lasting intra-erythrocytic bacteremia in theirnatural host. These bacteria translocate Bartonella effector proteins (Beps) intohost cells via their VirB/VirD4 type 4 secretion system (T4SS) in order tosubvert host cellular functions, thereby leading to the downregulation of innate immune responses. Most studies on the functional analysis of the VirB/VirD4 T4SS and the Beps were performed with the major zoonotic pathogen Bartonella henselae for which efficient in vitro infection protocols have been established. However, its natural host, the cat, is unsuitable as an experimental infection model. Invivo studies were mostly confined to rodent models using rodent-specificBartonella species, while the in vitro infection protocols devised for B.henselae are not transferable for those pathogens. The disparities of in vitroand in vivo studies in different species have hampered progress in ourunderstanding of Bartonella pathogenesis. Here we describe the murine-specificstrain Bartonella taylorii IBS296 as a new model organism facilitating the study of bacterial pathogenesis both in vitro in cell cultures and in vivo inlaboratory mice. We implemented the split NanoLuc luciferase-based translocation assay to study BepD translocation through the VirB/VirD4 T4SS. We found increasedeffector-translocation into host cells if the bacteria were grown on tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates and experienced a temperature shift immediately beforeinfection. The improved infectivity in vitro was correlating to an upregulationof the VirB/VirD4 T4SS. Using our adapted infection protocols, we showedBepD-dependent immunomodulatory phenotypes in vitro. In mice, the implementedgrowth conditions enabled infection by a massively reduced inoculum withouthaving an impact on the course of the intra-erythrocytic bacteremia. Theestablished model opens new avenues to study the role of the VirB/VirD4 T4SS and the translocated Bep effectors in vitro and in vivo.

AB  - Precocious puberty mostly stems from endocrine disorders. However, more and more studies show that a high-fat diet (HFD) is closely related to precocious puberty,but its mechanism is unknown. Since gut microbiota is associated with hormonesecretion and obesity, it inspires us to detect the mechanism of gut microbiotain triggering precocious puberty. The model of precocious puberty was establishedby feeding female mice with an HFD from 21 days old. After puberty, the serumhormone levels, gut microbiome sequencing, and metabolomics were collected. DNAwas extracted from feces, and the V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene wasamplified, followed by microbial composition analysis. Subsequently, associationsbetween precocious puberty and the microbiota were determined. We found that (1) HFD after weaning caused precocious puberty, increased serum estradiol, leptin,deoxycholic acid (DCA), and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in thehypothalamus; (2) Through correlation analysis, we found that GnRH was positivelycorrelated with Desulfovibrio, Lachnoclostridium, GCA-900066575, Streptococcus,Anaerotruncus, and Bifidobacterium, suggesting that these bacteria may have arole in promoting sexual development. (3) "HFD-microbiota" transplantationpromoted the precocious puberty of mice. (4) Estrogen changes the composition andproportion of gut microbiota and promotes precocious puberty. Therefore, theeffect of HFD on precocious puberty is regulated by the interaction of gutmicrobiota and hormones.

AB  - Nematodes in the genus Phasmarhabditis can infect and kill slugs and snails,which are important agricultural pests. This useful trait has been commercializedby the corporation BASF after they mass produced a product labeled Nemaslug(R).The product contains Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, which has been cultured with Moraxella osloensis, a bacterial strain that was originally thought to beresponsible for causing mortality in slugs and snails. The exact mechanismleading to death in a Phasmarhabditis infected host is unknown but may involvecontributions from nematode-associated bacteria. The naturally occurringmicrobial community of Phasmarhabditis is unexplored; the previousPhasmarhabditis microbial community studies have focused on laboratory grown orcommercially reared nematodes, and in order to obtain a deeper understanding ofthe parasite and its host interactions, it is crucial to characterize the naturalmicrobial communities associated with this organism in the wild. We sampledPhasmarhabditis californica, Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita, and Phasmarhabditispapillosa directly from their habitats in Central and Southern Californianurseries and garden centers and identified their native microbial community via 16S amplicon sequencing. We found that the Phasmarhabditis microbial communitywas influenced by species, location, and possibly gastropod host from which thenematode was collected. The predominant bacteria of the Phasmarhabditis isolates collected included Shewanella, Clostridium perfringens, Aeromonadaceae,Pseudomonadaceae, and Acinetobacter. Phasmarhabditis papillosa isolates exhibitedan enrichment with species belonging to Acinetobacter or Pseudomonadaceae.However, further research must be performed to determine if this is due to thelocation of isolate collection or a species specific microbial community pattern.More work on the natural microbial community of Phasmarhabditis is needed todetermine the role of bacteria in nematode virulence.

This studyreports on the facile synthesis of colloidal ferric oxide nanoparticles as novel nano-fertilizer to promote vegetation and to suppress Fusarium wilt disease intomato plant. Disease index, protection percent, photosynthetic pigments, andmetabolic indicators of resistance in plant as response to induction of systemic resistance (SR) were recorded. Results illustrated that Fe2O3 NPs had antifungal activity against F. oxysporum. Fe2O3 NPs (at 20 microg/mL) was the best treatmentand reduced percent disease indexes by 15.62 and gave highly protection againstdisease by 82.15% relative to untreated infected plants. Fe2O3 NPs treatments in either (non-infected or infected) plants showed improvements in photosyntheticpigments, osmolytes, and antioxidant enzymes activity. The beneficial effects of the synthesized Fe2O3 NPs were extended to increase not only photosyntheticpigments, osmolytes contents but also the activities of peroxidase (POD),polyphenol oxidase (PPO), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), enzymes of the healthy and infected tomato plants in comparison with control. For,peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activities it was found that, application ofFe2O3 NPs (10 microg/mL) on challenged plants offered the best treatments whichincreased the activities of POD by (34.4%) and PPO by (31.24%). On the otherhand, application of Fe2O3 NPs (20 microg/mL) on challenged plants offered thebest treatments which increased the activities of CAT by (30.9%), and SOD by(31.33%).

AB  - A process development from a traditional grain-based fermentation to a definedwater kefir fermentation using a co-culture of one lactic acid bacterium and one yeast was elaborated as a prerequisite for an industrially scalable,controllable, and reproducible process. Further, to meet a healthy lifestyle, alow ethanol-containing product was aimed for. Five microbialstrains-Hanseniaspora valbyensis, Dekkera bruxellensis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Liquorilactobacillus nagelii, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides-were used in pairs inorder to examine their influence on the fermentation progress and the properties of the resulting water kefir products against grains as a control. Thereby, thecombination of H. valbyensis and L. mesenteroides provided the best-rated waterkefir beverage in terms of taste and low ethanol concentrations at the same time.As a further contribution to harmonization and reduction of complexity, the usageof dried figs in the medium was replaced by fig syrup, which could have beenproven as an adequate substitute. However, nutritional limitations were facedafterward, and thus, an appropriate supplementation strategy for yeast extractwas established. Finally, comparative trials in 5-L scale applying grains as wellas a defined microbial consortium showed both water kefir beverages characterizedby a pH of 3.14, and lactic acid and aromatic sensory properties. The productresulting from co-culturing outperformed the grain-based one, as the ethanollevel was considerably lower in favor of an increased amount of lactic acid. The possibility of achieving a water kefir product by using only two species showshigh potential for further detailed research of microbial interactions and thusfunctionality of water kefir.

TI  - Qingchang Wenzhong Decoction Prevents the Occurrence of Intestinal Tumors byRegulating Intestinal Microbiota and Gasdermin E.
PG  - 917323
LID - 10.3389/fphys.2022.917323 [doi]
AB  - Background: Intestinal tumors are the third most common malignant tumorsworldwide, accounting for approximately 10% of all new cancer cases worldwide.Cancer prevention is a promising way to limit the intestinal tumor incidencerate; however, challenges remain. Qingchang Wenzhong decoction (QCWZD) canclinically treat mild to moderate ulcerative colitis symptoms. Moreover, themechanism by which it prevents intestinal tumors has not been clarified. In this study, we explored the mechanism by which QCWZD prevents the occurrence ofintestinal tumors. Methods: To study the preventive mechanism of QCWZD onintestinal tumors, we used two model mice with azoxymethane/dextran sodiumsulfate (AOM/DSS)- and Apc(min/+)-induced intestinal tumor formation. The twomodels exhibited colitis-associated cancer and familial adenomatous polyposis,respectively. Colon and small intestine tissues were collected and analyzed basedon histopathology and immunohistochemistry analyses. Fecal samples werecollected, and 16S rRNA sequencing was used to analyze the correlation betweenintestinal microbiota and the prevention of intestinal tumors. Results: In theAOM/DSS mice, the QCWZD reduced the number and size of tumors, as well as tumorload. Similarly, in the Apc(min/+) mice, QCWZD can also reduce the number oftumors and the tumor load. The results of 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed thatQCWZD altered the composition of intestinal microbiota in mice, a phenomenon thatmay prevent the occurrence of intestinal tumors by aiding the increase in theabundance of beneficial bacteria, such as Ralstonia and Butyricicoccus, andreducing that of pathogenic bacteria, such as Desulfobacterota and Bacteroides,in the intestine. Further, immunohistochemistry reveald that QCWZD can improvethe expression of intestinal barrier-related proteins and inhibitpyroptosis-related proteins. Conclusions: QCWZD has the potential to prevent the occurrence of intestinal tumors. The anti-tumor activity may be achieved byregulating the intestinal microbiota, improving the function of the intestinalbarrier, and inhibiting GSDME mediated pyroptosis.
